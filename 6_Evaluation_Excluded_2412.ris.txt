AB  - Cancer care has been profoundly impacted by the global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19), resulting in unprecedented challenges. Supportive care is an essential component of cancer treatment, seeking to prevent and manage chemotherapy complications such as febrile neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia/bleeding, thromboembolic events and nausea/vomiting, all of which are common causes of hospitalisation. These adverse events are an essential consideration under routine patient management, but particularly so during a pandemic, a setting in which clinicians aim to minimise patients' risk of infection and need for hospital visits. Professional medical oncology societies have been providing updated guidelines to support health care professionals with the management, treatment and supportive care needs of their patients with cancer under the threat of COVID-19. This paper aims to review the recommendations made by the most prominent medical oncology societies for devising and modifying supportive care strategies during the pandemic.

AB  - The unique clinical features of COVID-19 disease present a formidable challenge in the understanding of its pathogenesis. Within a very short time, our knowledge regarding basic physiologic pathways that participate in SARS CoV-2 invasion and subsequent organ damage have been dramatically expanded. In particular, we now better understand the complexity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the important role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 in viral binding. Furthermore, the critical role of its major product, angiotensin (Ang) 1-7, in maintaining microcirculatory balance and in the control of activated pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant pathways, generated in this disease, have been clarified. The kalikrein-bradykinin (BK) system and chymase are intensively interwoven with RAAS through many pathways with complex reciprocal interactions. Yet, so far, very little attention has been paid to a possible role of these physiologic pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease, even though BK and chymase exert many physiologic changes characteristic to this disorder. Herein we outline the current knowledge regarding the reciprocal interactions of RAAS, BK and chymase that are probably turned-on in COVID-19 disease and participate in its clinical features. Interventions affecting these systems, such as the inhibition of chymase or blocking BKB1R/BKB2R might be explored as potential novel therapeutic strategies in this devastating disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compile current published reports on nosocomial outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evaluate the role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in transmission, and evaluate outbreak management practices. METHODS: Narrative literature review. SHORT CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a large burden on hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide, which increases the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreaks to "non-COVID" patients or residents, who represent the highest-risk population in terms of mortality, as well as HCWs. To date, there are several reports on nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, and although the attack rate is variable, it can be as high as 60%, with high mortality. There is currently little evidence on transmission dynamics, particularly using genomic sequencing, and the role of HCWs in initiating or amplifying nosocomial outbreaks is not elucidated. There has been a paradigm shift in management practices of viral respiratory outbreaks, that includes widespread testing of patients (or residents) and HCWs, including asymptomatic individuals. These expanded testing criteria appear to be crucial in identifying and controlling outbreaks.

AB  - The stormy clouds of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak caused a rapidly spreading epidemic still hanging over the sphere. Any steps to transition toward a new normal should be guided by health authorities, together with economic and societal considerations. There are various items mainly falling into three classifications, including patient worry, clinical demand, and economic recession. Social distancing, lay-offs, and decreased number of patients with health insurance may lead to a prolonged period to retrieve normalcy. To return to a new normal, an individualized management model should be developed for each laboratory based on staff, instruments, services, crowding, physical space, hospital base unit, or outpatient clinic. Continuous training of different occupational staffs is among the key parameters in maintaining this readiness. The proposed response model should have internal and systemic integrity as well as coherence among the included items in two intra- and inter-unit management categories, namely thinking globally and acting locally.

AB  - Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has infected more than ten million persons worldwide. Therefore, researchers are trying to address various aspects that may help in diagnosis this pneumonia. Image segmentation is a necessary pr-processing step that implemented in image analysis and classification applications. Therefore, in this study, our goal is to present an efficient image segmentation method for COVID-19 Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed image segmentation method depends on improving the density peaks clustering (DPC) using generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The DPC is faster than other clustering methods, and it provides more stable results. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal number of clustering centers automatically without visualization. So, GEV is used to determine the suitable threshold value to find the optimal number of clustering centers that lead to improving the segmentation process. The proposed model is applied for a set of twelve COVID-19 CT images. Also, it was compared with traditional k-means and DPC algorithms, and it has better performance using several measures, such as PSNR, SSIM, and Entropy.

AB  - Introduction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) achieved response rates around 20% in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 8% of patients becoming long-term survivors. Outcomes have improved with the addition of chemotherapy to immunotherapy or the combination of anti-PD(L)1 with anti-CTLA-4 agents. Areas covered. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs varied across clinical trials and real-life studies. The onset of irAEs was 10 weeks. Toxic deaths from irAEs following anti-PD(L)1 administration resulted mainly from pneumonitis. Some irAEs such as rash and thyroiditis were probably associated with better clinical outcomes, though confounding biases exist. Investigations are on-going to determine ideal biomarkers to predict the occurrence, to screen for and to diagnose irAEs. Expert opinion. Prevention, anticipation, detection, treatment and careful monitoring are the five principles that characterize our management of irAEs. Distinguishing immune-induced pneumonitis from progression, pseudo progression, hyper progression or other etiologies (COVID-19) can be particularly challenging in lung cancer due to the baseline vulnerable pulmonary function and thus requires caution and teamwork. We treat patients according to institutional and international guidelines and we only rechallenge them with ICIs after resolution of the AE and corticosteroid tapering.

AB  - Background: Higher education quality is an essential measurement for any country's development, since education is a significant source of new sciences and its applications. This importance works as one of the cornerstones toward public health. The sudden change from traditional classroom teaching and learning to online education and learning process did not give educators the time to adjust the teaching material or, for that matter, did not give the program administrators the time to prepare for the needed documents toward the accreditation. This situation creates a dilemma for all members involved in certification. This research is addressing this issue from the accreditation point of view. Design: Brainstorming methodology is used to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the academic/health accreditation. Methods: Cause and effect diagram (Fishbone diagram) is used to present the ideas presented by institutional participants related to the effect of COVID-19 on the accreditations processes. Conclusions: The study shows that COVID-19 pandemics have dramatic influence on accreditation processes, which may lead to change and/or adjust the rules and the requirements of the educational institutions due to changes in the fulfillment of the accreditation by the institutions during this period.

AB  - Background: In restorative dentistry, the use of high-speed air turbine, which generates aerosols, can be associated with the transmission of airborne diseases. New laser technologies could be useful in reducing the amount of aerosols, but there is a lack of scientific research on this topic. Material and Methods: This is a descriptive study to analyze the amount of aerosols produced after class I cavity preparation using high-speed air turbine (group 1) and Er,Cr:YSGG laser with two different parameters (groups 2 and 3). Fluorescein dye was incorporated into the coolant reservoir in order to visualize the production of aerosols during each procedure. Tooth preparation was performed in a typodont with human lower molar tooth under rubber dam isolation. The procedure was carried out in a transparent plastic box to avoid aerosols dispersion. Sixteen grade I cellulose filter discs were distributed along the surfaces of the box. The area contaminated with aerosols in the filters was measured using ultraviolet illumination. Results: In group 1, the contaminated surface area covered with fluorescein dye reached 77.3% (1349 cm2) of the total; in group 2 (laser with 80% water) we observed 7.3% (128 cm2) and in group 3 (laser with 40% water) it was 3.8% (68 cm2). The reduction in water parameter from 80% to 40% coincided with 48% reduction of the contaminated area on the filter discs. Focusing on the surfaces of the box, we noted that the mean contamination on the left side was more than on the right side in all three experimental groups. In group 1 using air turbine, we measured a mean of 102.6[±7.5 SD]cm2 on the left side, compared to 70.6[±32.3 SD]cm2 on the right side. In laser groups 2 and 3, a mean of 12.8[±14.9 SD]cm2 and 6.8 [±5.7SD]cm2, respectively, was described on the left surface versus 0 cm2 of surface contamination on the right surface. Conclusions: The contaminated area during the procedure of class I cavity preparation, is reduced by 70% using Er,Cr:YSGG laser compared to high-speed turbine. A slightly higher contamination was observed between laser groups with 80% versus 40% water. The use of Er,Cr:YSGG laser in restorative dentistry can be a valid treatment alternative to reduce aerosols production compared to conventional high-speed rotary instruments. Key words:Er,Cr:YSGG laser, Aerosols, SARS-CoV-2, Rotary instruments, conservative dentistry.

AB  - Background & Objective: The world is facing COVID-19 pandemic, and medical education system and consequently the evaluation of students at different levels have been overshadowed. Residency students are among those affected. In the present study, we aim to share our experiences regarding holding exams for pathology residents before and during the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The online exam, which consisted of 30 multiple-choice questions, was designed and held in April 2020 to evaluate pathology residents. To assess the quality of the exam, indices such as the number of questions, highest and lowest scores, the average score, the standard deviation, the variance, Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient, standard error of measurement, discrimination index, difficulty index, number/percentage of questions on three difficulty levels of easy, normal, hard were reviewed and analyzed. Results and Discussion: The average score of the participants in the January exam which was held in the university's exam center was 16.23 (±5.03), while the average score in the online exam which was held after the onset of the pandemic was 20.86 (±5.18). The average discrimination indices in the first and second exams were 0.36 and 0.38, respectively, and the average difficulty indices in the first and second exams were 0.54 and 0.70, respectively. We found the administration of this online examination would be a positive experience. By sharing it, we hope to pave the way for similar ventures in the other departments.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic thrust health care professionals around the globe to the frontlines to care for those affected by this medical crisis. While many surgical and procedural medical subspecialties experienced drastic declines in patient visits during this time, the demand for psychiatric services was more stable. In response to statewide stay at home orders, third-year residents in the psychiatry outpatient clinic described in this article quickly transitioned to telepsychiatry to continue providing care to their patients. While providing care from home, these residents experienced a number of challenges that serve as important lessons for enhancing competence in telepsychiatry services.

AB  - The rapid outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that was first identified in Wuhan, China is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The 3CL protease (3CLpro) is the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the viral replication and therefore considered as an attractive drug target since to date there is no specific and effective vaccine available against this virus. In this paper, we reported molecular docking-based virtual screening (VS) of 2000 compounds obtained from the ZINC database and 10 FDA-approved (antiviral and anti-malaria) on 3CLpro using AutoDock Vina to find potential inhibitors. The screening results showed that the top four compounds, namely ZINC32960814, ZINC12006217, ZINC03231196, and ZINC33173588 exhibited high affinity at the 3CLpro binding pocket. Their free energy of binding (FEB) were -12.3, -11.9, -11.7, and -11.2 kcal/mol while AutoDock Vina scores were -12.61, -12.32, -12.01, and -11.92 kcal/mol, respectively. These results were better than the co-crystallized ligand N3, whereby its FEB was -7.5 kcal/mol and FDA-approved drugs. Different but stable interactions were obtained between the four identified compounds with the catalytic dyad residues of the 3CLpro. In conclusion, novel 3CLpro inhibitors from the ZINC database were successfully identified using VS and molecular docking approach, fulfilling the Lipinski rule of five, and having low FEB and functional molecular interactions with the target protein. The findings suggests that the identified compounds may serve as potential leads that act as COVID-19 3CLpro inhibitors, worthy for further evaluation and development.

AB  - The rapidly developing pandemic, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently spread across 213 countries and territories. This pandemic is a dire public health threat-particularly for those suffering from hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, or diabetes; without approved treatments, it is likely to persist or recur. To facilitate the rapid discovery of inhibitors with clinical potential, we have applied ligand- and structure-based computational approaches to develop a virtual screening methodology that allows us to predict potential inhibitors. In this work, virtual screening was performed against two natural products databases, Super Natural II and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Additionally, we have used an integrated drug repurposing approach to computationally identify potential inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 in databases of drugs (both approved and withdrawn). Roughly 360,000 compounds were screened using various molecular fingerprints and molecular docking methods; of these, 80 docked compounds were evaluated in detail, and the 12 best hits from four datasets were further inspected via molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, toxicity and cytochrome inhibition profiles were computationally analyzed for the selected candidate compounds.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is now a global public health concern and has had an enormous adverse impact in both developed and developing countries. In Africa, in August 2020, the total number of confirmed cases was 1 022 401 cases, with 704 704 recovered and 22 501 deaths. People with co-morbidities are at increased risk of complications and COVID-19-related death. Evidence on the burden and outcome among patients with co-morbid diseases has not been published in Africa, so this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify these.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is now a global public health concern and has had an enormous adverse impact in both developed and developing countries. In Africa, in August 2020, the total number of confirmed cases was 1 022 401 cases, with 704 704 recovered and 22 501 deaths. People with co-morbidities are at increased risk of complications and COVID-19-related death. Evidence on the burden and outcome among patients with co-morbid diseases has not been published in Africa, so this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify these. Observational studies reporting on the burden and outcome of COVD-19 among patients with co-morbid diseases in Africa will be included and a search of online databases PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, HINARI, Cochrane Library, World Health Organization COVID-19 database, Africa Wide Knowledge and Web of Science will be applied. Two independent authors will carry out data extraction and assess the risk of bias using a predetermined and structured method of data collection.

AB  - A novel coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread globally. Several treatments have been proposed, many of which have proven ineffective. Consequently, there is a need to review the published evidence of drug clinical trials to guide future prescribing. A systematic review of published clinical trials and retrospective observational studies was carried out. The search was made using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Articles published between January 2020 and October 2020 and written in the English language were retrieved and included in the study. Researches that used traditional medicine, in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies, as well as reviews were excluded. Seventy-three relevant articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were finally selected and reviewed. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin produced no clinical evidence of efficacy in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT). However, retrospective observational studies reported the efficacy of remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir in reducing viral load, although there have been concerns with lopinavir/ritonavir and, more recently, remdesivir. Recently, tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone significantly relieved lung inflammation and decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, convalescent plasma was effective in boosting strong immunity among patients with mild COVID-19. There is currently no single worldwide approved therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19 despite the initial hype with medicines, including hydroxychloroquine. Nonetheless, dexamethasone has shown promise in symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma in boosting immunity. New treatments are currently being researched, and the findings will be reported accordingly to provide evidence-based guidance for prescribers and policymakers.

AB  - In this COVID-19 pandemic, a non-contact handheld infrared thermometer is frequently used for fever screening. However, the handheld thermometer performance depends on the operator and the distance to the forehead. To address these problems, we present an infrared thermometer on the wall (iThermowall). The iThermowall is a low-cost non-contact thermometer, adapted for the use of fever screening in public areas without an operator. The hardware can measure human body temperature automatically when the distance between the sensor and forehead is adequate. Temperature measurement validation of the iThermowall was conducted by T-test analysis. The results show that the P-values for all the test is more significant than 0.05, means that the mean Celsius temperature for both groups (reference thermometer and iThermowall) are similar. This article provides the 3-D printable open-source and the full source code firmware for the developing and under-resourced communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of human factors/ergonomics (HFE) is well established in all high-reliability systems but only applied in the healthcare sector relatively recently. Across many sectors, low-/middle-income countries (LMICs) lag behind more economically developed countries in their application of this safety science, due to resource and, in some cases, awareness and expertise. Most previous applications of HFE related to occupational ergonomics rather than healthcare safety. METHODS: The paper details how the reputation of HFE is being developed within healthcare communities of Latin America (LatAm), through increasing awareness and understanding of its role as safety science in the healthcare sector. It starts by articulating the need for HFE and then provides examples from Mexico, Colombia and Peru. RESULTS: The practical examples for research and education illustrate a developing awareness of the relevance of HFE to the healthcare sectors in LatAm and an appreciation of its worth to improve health service quality and patient safety through healthcare community engagement. A new LatAm Network of HFE in Healthcare Systems (RELAESA) was formed in 2019, which has provided a platform for HFE advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a real opportunity in LatAm and other LMIC health services to make more rapid and sustainable progress in healthcare-embedded HFE than has been experienced within healthcare services of more developed nations.

AB  - Around the world, the antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) is currently being used to treat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Investigating the chemical and physical properties of compounds used alone or in combination to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is of vital and pressing importance. The purpose of this study was to characterize the charge transfer (CT) complexation of AZM with iodine in four different solvents: CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, and C6H5Cl. AZM reacted with iodine at a 1:1 M ratio (AZM to I2) in the CHCl3 solvent and a 1:2 M ratio in the other three solvents, as evidenced by data obtained from an elemental analysis of the solid CT products and spectrophotometric titration and Job's continuous variation method for the soluble CT products. Data obtained from UV-visible and Raman spectroscopies indicated that AZM strongly interacted with iodine in the CH2Cl2, CCl4, and C6H5Cl solvents by a physically potent n→σ* interaction to produce a tri-iodide complex formulated as [AZM·I+]I3-. XRD and TEM analyses revealed that, in all solvents, the AZM-I2 complex possessed an amorphous structure composed of spherical particles ranging from 80 to 110 nm that tended to aggregate into clusters. The findings described in the present study will hopefully contribute to optimizing the treatment protocols for COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented burden on healthcare resources and this includes treatment of heart failure and valvular heart diseases (VHD). Percutaneous procedures have broadened the number of patients with VHD who could be treated. However, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged their implementation. The risk of in-hospital infection, resources reallocation, reduced access to hospital caused a substantial delay of VHD treatment with an increased risk of clinical worsening and mortality. Now, the pandemic is not ended and subsequent waves are likely. Reorganization of our healthcare resources is needed, including a proper algorithm for patients' prioritization, based on the severity of their valve disease, their life expectancy, complexity of the intervention, and the resources available. A wider use of telemedicine for patients' selection and follow-up and any measurement that can shorten the duration of the hospital stay must be adopted. Patients' and healthcare staff screening for COVID-19 and all needed procedures to prevent infection will continue to be mandatory. Percutaneous procedures, compared to surgery, are associated with a lower risk of infection and a lower need for in-hospital resources, including a shorter duration of hospital stay. This may favour their adoption when the risk of viral infection is high.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract viruses are the second most common cause for olfactory dysfunction. As we learn more about the effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with the recognition that olfactory dysfunction is a key symptom of this disease process, there is now a greater need for evidence-based management for post infectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD). OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence based practical guide to the management of PIOD (including post-covid cases) for both primary care practitioners and hospital specialists. METHODS: A systematic review was performed on the treatment options available for the management of PIOD. The written systematic review was then circulated among the members of the Clinical Olfactory Working Group (COWoG) for their perusal prior to round table expert discussion of the treatment options. The group also undertook a survey to determine their current clinical practice with regards to treatment of PIOD. RESULTS: The search resulted in 467 citations from which 107 articles were fully reviewed and analysed for eligibility; 40 citations fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 11 of which were randomised controlled trials. In total, 15 of the articles specifically looked at PIOD whilst the other 25 included other aetiologies for olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The COWoG members made an overwhelming recommendation for olfactory training and none recommended monocycline antibiotics. The diagnostic role of oral steroids is discussed and there were some in favour of vitamin A drops. Further research is needed to confirm the place of other therapeutic options.

AB  - Hydroxychloroquine has gained much attention as one of the candidate drugs that can be repurposed as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high transmissibility and presence of asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic transmission, there is need for a chemoprophylactic agent to protect the high-risk population. In this review, we dissect the currently available evidence on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis from a clinical and pharmacological point of view. In vitro studies on Vero cells show that hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by affecting viral entry and viral transport via endolysosomes. However, this efficacy has failed to replicate in in vivo animal models as well as in most clinical observational studies and clinical trials assessing pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers. An analysis of the pharmacology of HCQ in COVID-19 reveals certain possible reasons for this failure-a pharmacokinetic failure due to failure to achieve adequate drug concentration at the target site and attenuation of its inhibitory effect due to the presence of TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells. Currently, many clinical trials on HCQ prophylaxis in HCW are ongoing; these factors should be taken into account. Using higher doses of HCQ for prophylaxis is likely to be associated with increased safety concerns; thus, it may be worthwhile to focus on other possible interventions.

AB  - COVID-19 is a buzz word nowadays. The deadly virus that started in China has spread worldwide. The fundamental principle is "if the disease can travel faster information has to travel even faster". The sequence of events reveals the upheaval need to strengthen the ability of the early warning system, risk reduction, and management of national and global risks. Digital contact tracing apps like Aarogya setu (India) and Pan-European privacy preserving proximity tracing (German) has somehow helped but they are more effective in the initial stage and less relevant in the community spread phase. Thus, there is a need to devise a Decision Support System (DSS) based on machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we have attempted to propose an Additive Utility Assumption Approach for Criterion Comparison in Multi-criterion Intelligent Decision Support system for COVID-19. The dataset of Covid-19 has been taken from government link for validating the results. In this paper, an additive utility assumption-based approach for multi-criterion decision support system (MCDSS) with an accurate prediction of identified risk factors on certain well-defined input parameters is proposed and validated empirically using the standard SEIR model approach (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered). The results includes comparative analysis in tabular form with already existing approaches to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach including the parameters such as Precision, Recall and F-Score. Other advanced parameters such as, MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient), ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) and PRC (Precision Recall) have also been considered for validation and the graphs are illustrated using Jupyter notebook. The statistical analysis of the most affected top eight states of India is undertaken effectively using the Weka software tool and IBM Cognos software to correctly predict the outbreak of pandemic situation due to Covid-19. Finally, the article has immense potential to contribute to the COVID-19 situation and may prove to be instrumental in propelling the research interest of researchers and providing some useful insights for the current pandemic situation.

AB  - Human infectious diseases are contributed equally by the host immune system's efficiency and any pathogens' infectivity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2, one needs to unravel the intricacies of host immune response to the virus, the viral pathogen's mode of transmission, and alterations in specific biological pathways in the host allowing viral survival. This review critically analyzes recent research using high-throughput "omics" technologies (including proteomics and metabolomics) on various biospecimens that allow an increased understanding of the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The altered biomolecule profile facilitates an understanding of altered biological pathways. Further, we have performed a meta-analysis of significantly altered biomolecular profiles in COVID-19 patients using bioinformatics tools. Our analysis deciphered alterations in the immune response, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism and other pathways that cumulatively result in COVID-19 disease, including symptoms such as hyperglycemic and hypoxic sequelae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been mirrored by diffusion of misinformation and conspiracy theories about its origins (such as 5G cellular networks) and the motivations of preventive measures like vaccination, social distancing, and face masks (for example, as a political ploy). These beliefs have resulted in substantive, negative real-world outcomes but remain largely unstudied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey (n=660). Participants were asked about the believability of five selected COVID-19 narratives, their political orientation, their religious commitment, and their trust in science (a 21-item scale), along with sociodemographic items. Data were assessed descriptively, then latent profile analysis was used to identify subgroups with similar believability profiles. Bivariate (ANOVA) analyses were run, then multivariable, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with membership in specific COVID-19 narrative believability profiles. RESULTS: For the full sample, believability of the narratives varied, from a low of 1.94 (SD=1.72) for the 5G narrative to a high of 5.56 (SD=1.64) for the zoonotic (scientific consensus) narrative. Four distinct belief profiles emerged, with the preponderance (70%) of the sample falling into Profile 1, which believed the scientifically accepted narrative (zoonotic origin) but not the misinformed or conspiratorial narratives. Other profiles did not disbelieve the zoonotic explanation, but rather believed additional misinformation to varying degrees. Controlling for sociodemographics, political orientation and religious commitment were marginally, and typically non-significantly, associated with COVID-19 belief profile membership. However, trust in science was a strong, significant predictor of profile membership, with lower trust being substantively associated with belonging to Profiles 2 through 4. CONCLUSIONS: Belief in misinformation or conspiratorial narratives may not be mutually exclusive from belief in the narrative reflecting scientific consensus; that is, profiles were distinguished not by belief in the zoonotic narrative, but rather by concomitant belief or disbelief in additional narratives. Additional, renewed dissemination of scientifically accepted narratives may not attenuate belief in misinformation. However, prophylaxis of COVID-19 misinformation might be achieved by taking concrete steps to improve trust in science and scientists, such as building understanding of the scientific process and supporting open science initiatives.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 poses a serious threat to public health. The protocol developed at the Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale (Italy) is based on clinical data, laboratory tests, chest echography and HRCT. Several therapeutic options are considered, since patients vary in disease severity, evolution and co-morbidities and because so far there are no clear indications about therapeutic strategy based on randomized clinical trial. In this protocol chest echography has a central role in categorizing patient status, follow-up and decision-making.

AB  - Personal protective equipment (PPE) plays a fundamental role in the prevention of spread to Health Care Professionals (HCP) ; especially in a surgical setting. This scoping review of surgery guidelines was performed to appraise the quality of appropriate PPE recommendations and propose a strategy to optimize the PPE usage. This rapid scoping review of guidelines on surgery during COVID-19 was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews protocol. Important databases were searched from January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, for relevant studies produced by a national/international academic association/organization, in English literature, using relevant keywords. Quality of evidence was graded according to GRADE guidelines. The searches yielded a total of 1725 studies, out of these 41 guidelines on surgery during COVID-19 matching with pre-defined criteria were evaluated. The level of evidence was uniformly rated "low," as assessed by GRADE guidelines and recommendations provided by them were mostly non-specific covering a narrow range of items. The crucial issue of optimization of PPE was not addressed at all. Economic implications demand optimization of PPE and conservation of resources. A simple decision-making algorithm addressing all the limitations of guidelines can be constructed, which allows HCPs to safeguard themselves and at the same time optimize/ conserving resources.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus for which no known effective antiviral drugs are available. In the present study, to accelerate the discovery of potential drug candidates, bioinformatics-based in silico drug discovery approaches are utilized. We performed multiple sequence alignments of the Spike (S) protein with 75 sequences of different viruses from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. This provided us with insights into the evolutionarily conserved domains that can be targeted using drugs or specific antibodies. Further, we analyzed the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 core proteins, i.e., S and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), to elucidate how the virus infection can utilize hemoglobin to decrease the blood oxygen level. Moreover, after a comprehensive literature survey, more than 60 antiviral drugs were chosen. The candidate drugs were then ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike and RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The present multidimensional study further advances our understanding of the novel viral molecular targets and potential of computational approaches for therapeutic assessments. The present study can be a steppingstone in the selection of potential drug candidates to be used either as a treatment or as a reference point when designing a new drug/antibody/inhibitory peptide/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background: Reduced time allocation, changes in teaching methods and Covid-19 have resulted in undergraduate anatomy teaching being marginalised.This has implications on patient safety, litigation, student satisfaction and surgical workforce planning. Aims: The aim of this study is to survey a cohort of recent English medical graduates to attain their perspective on anatomy training and to propose an innovative solution to solve existing problems in undergraduate anatomy training. Methods: An online survey was sent out to 40 foundation doctors to offer insights into their undergraduate anatomy training. We asked participants to rate their perceived importance of anatomy, the importance offered to anatomy teaching at undergraduate level, preparation for clinical practice and future career plans. Results: 22 participants responded to the online survey. All trained across England with equal spread between Northern and Southern medical schools. All participants perceived anatomy to be either important or very important in the survey. 20/22 felt that their undergraduate anatomy teaching was given very low to average importance by their institutions. 8/22 were confident or very confident with their anatomy knowledge on beginning clinical practice. Of the 22, 5 planned surgical careers, 10 did not know or gave other responses and 7 wanted to do General Practice. 16/22 said anatomy training had or will impact their decision on choosing a speciality. Conclusion: The current literature and above survey highlight the deficiencies that current doctors are facing.We suggest implementation of a standardised anatomy curriculum and the development of an online anatomy course.

AB  - Regarding the urgency of therapeutic measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of available drugs with FDA approval is preferred because of the less time and cost required for their development. In silico drug repurposing is an accurate way to speed up the screening of the existing FDA-approved drugs to find a therapeutic option for COVID-19. The similarity in SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 fusion mechanism to host cells can be a key point for Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by HIV fusion inhibitors. Accordingly, in this study, an HIV-1 fusion inhibitor called Enfuvirtide (Enf) was selected. The affinity and essential residues involving in the Enf binding to the S2 protein of SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1 gp41 protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as a negative control, was evaluated using molecular docking. Eventually, Enf-S2 and Enf-gp41 protein complexes were simulated by molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of binding affinity and stability. Based on the most important criteria such as docking score, cluster size, energy and dissociation constant, the strongest interaction was observed between Enf with the S2 protein. In addition, MD results confirmed that Enf-S2 protein interaction was remarkably stable and caused the S2 protein residues to undergo the fewest fluctuations. In conclusion, it can be stated that Enf can act as a strong SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor and demonstrates the potential to enter the clinical trial phase of COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Effective and efficient management of human betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus infection i.e., COVID-19 pandemic, required sensitive and selective sensors with short sample-to-result durations for performing desired diagnostics. In this direction, one appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at low level i.e., femtomolar (fM) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research is focused on the fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody specific to spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein are monitored. Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein with significantly low as limit of detection (LoD) was achieved as ~4.2 fM. We envisage that outcomes of this research will pave the way toward the use of toroidal metasensors as practical technologies for rapid and precise screening of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and spike proteins in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and site of infection.

AB  - The emergence of a new coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for severe respiratory disease in humans termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), became a new global threat for health and the economy. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about a 29,800-nucleotide-long plus-strand RNA that can form functionally important secondary and higher-order structures called cis-acting RNA elements. These elements can interact with viral proteins, host proteins, or other RNAs and be involved in regulating translation and replication processes of the viral genome and encapsidation of the virus. However, the cis-acting RNA elements and their biological roles in SARS-CoV-2 as well as their comparative analysis in the closely related viral genome have not been well explored, which is very important to understand the molecular mechanism of viral infection and pathogenies. In this study, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify the cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Initially, we aligned the full genomic sequence of six different CoVs, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed to understand their evolutionary relationship. Next, we predicted the cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome using the structRNAfinder tool. Then, we annotated the location of these cis-acting RNA elements in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. After that, we analyzed the sequence conservation patterns of each cis-acting RNA element among the six CoVs. Finally, the presence of cis-acting RNA elements across different CoV genomes and their comparative analysis was performed. Our study identified 12 important cis-acting RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; among them, Corona_FSE, Corona_pk3, and s2m are highly conserved across most of the studied CoVs, and Thr_leader, MAT2A_D, and MS2 are uniquely present in SARS-CoV-2. These RNA structure elements can be involved in viral translation, replication, and encapsidation and, therefore, can be potential targets for better treatment of COVID-19. It is imperative to further characterize these cis-acting RNA elements experimentally for a better mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Comorbidities in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) not only increase morbidity and mortality but also confound disease activity, limit drug usage and increase chances of severe infections or drug-associated adverse effects. Most RMDs lead to accelerated atherosclerosis and variable manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Literature on COVID-19 in patients with RMDs, and the effects of various comorbidities on COVID-19 was reviewed. The initial data of COVID-19 infections in RMDs have not shown an increased risk for severe disease or the use of different immunosuppression. However, there are some emerging data that patients with RMDs and comorbidities may fare worse. Various meta-analyses have reiterated that pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, lung disease or obesity predispose to increased COVID-19 mortality. All these comorbidities are commonly encountered in the various RMDs. Presence of comorbidities in RMDs pose a greater risk than the RMDs themselves. A risk score based on comorbidities in RMDs should be developed to predict severe COVID-19 and death. Additionally, there should be active management of such comorbidities to mitigate these risks. The pandemic must draw our attention towards, and not away from, comorbidities.

AB  - New studies of COVID-19 are constantly updating best practices in clinical care. Often, it is impractical to apply recommendations based on high-income country investigations to resource limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We present a set of pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in LMICs. In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers. We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of "enhanced" or "intermediate" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE. If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, if there is high clinical suspicion for VTE, even in the absence of testing. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or Direct oral anticoagulants for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers. In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible to use, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE. We suggest D-dimer measurement, if available and affordable, at the time of admission for risk stratification, or when clinical suspicion for VTE is high. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we make no recommendation on the use of serial D-dimer monitoring for the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving intravenous therapeutic UFH, we recommend serial monitoring of partial thromboplastin time or anti-factor Xa level, based on local laboratory capabilities. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving LMWH, we suggest against serial monitoring of anti-factor Xa level. We suggest serial monitoring of platelet counts in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE, to assess risk of bleeding or development of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created an unprecedented threat to public health. The pandemic has been sweeping the globe, impacting more than 200 countries, with more outbreaks still lurking on the horizon. At the time of the writing, no approved drugs or vaccines are available to treat COVID-19 patients, prompting an urgent need to decipher mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and develop curative treatments. To fight COVID-19, researchers around the world have provided specific tools and molecular information for SARS-CoV-2. These pieces of information can be integrated to aid computational investigations and facilitate clinical research. This paper reviews current knowledge, the current status of drug development and various resources for key steps toward effective treatment of COVID-19, including the phylogenetic characteristics, genomic conservation and interaction data. The final goal of this paper is to provide information that may be utilized in bioinformatics approaches and aid target prioritization and drug repurposing. Several SARS-CoV-2-related tools/databases were reviewed, and a web-portal named OverCOVID (http://bis.zju.edu.cn/overcovid/) is constructed to provide a detailed interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 basics and share a collection of resources that may contribute to therapeutic advances. These information could improve researchers' understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and help to accelerate the development of new antiviral treatments.

AB  - The emergence and global impact of COVID-19 has focused the scientific and medical community on the pivotal influential role of respiratory viruses as causes of severe pneumonia, on the understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms, and on potential treatment for COVID-19. The latter concentrates on four different strategies: (i) antiviral treatments to limit the entry of the virus into the cell and its propagation, (ii) anti-inflammatory treatment to reduce the impact of COVID-19 associated inflammation and cytokine storm, (iii) treatment using cardiovascular medication to reduce COVID-19 associated thrombosis and vascular damage, and (iv) treatment to reduce the COVID-19 associated lung injury. Ideally, effective COVID-19 treatment should target as many of these mechanisms as possible arguing for the search of common denominators as potential drug targets. Leukotrienes and their receptors qualify as such targets: they are lipid mediators of inflammation and tissue damage and well-established targets in respiratory diseases like asthma. Besides their role in inflammation, they are involved in various other aspects of lung pathologies like vascular damage, thrombosis, and fibrotic response, in brain and retinal damages, and in cardiovascular disease. In consequence, leukotriene receptor antagonists might be potential candidates for COVID-19 therapeutics. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the potential involvement of leukotrienes in COVID-19, and the rational for the use of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast as a COVID-19 therapeutic.

Birth stories have frequently been used as a way for women to describe their experiences with the birthing process. In this uncertain time, birth stories can provide valuable insight into how pregnancy and birth stressors during a pandemic can impact the patient's overall experience. This study sought to describe and understand pregnant and new mothers' lived experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Researchers extracted relevant YouTube birth stories using predetermined search terms and inclusion criteria. The mothers' birth stories were narrated in their second or third trimester or those who had recently given birth during the study period. Birth stories were analyzed using an inductive and deductive approach to capture different aspects of the birthing experience. Results Overall, eighty-three birth stories were analyzed. Within these birth stories, four broad themes and twelve subthemes emerged. Key themes included a sense of loss, hospital experiences, experiences with healthcare providers, and unique experiences during birth and postpartum. The birth stories revealed negative and positive birth experiences. Particularly, mothers were frustrated with constantly changing policies within the healthcare setting that negatively affected their birthing experience. On the other hand, support from healthcare professionals, having their partners in the delivery room, and having a positive mindset was instrumental in having a positive birth experience. Conclusion Results from this study provided a detailed description of women's lived experience with giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers need to provide clear communication and compassionate patient-centered care to relieve women's anxiety about uncertain and unpredictable policy as the pandemic continues to evolve.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoneAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NAAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The unprecedented surge of nephrology inpatients needing kidney replacement therapy placed hospital systems under extreme stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we describe the formation of a cross campus "New-York Presbyterian COVID-19 Kidney Replacement Therapy Task Force" with intercampus physician, nursing, and supply chain representation. We describe several strategies including the development of novel dashboards to track supply/demand of resources, urgent start peritoneal dialysis, in-house preparation of kidney replacement fluid, the use of unconventional personnel resources to ensure the safe and continued provision of kidney replacement therapy in the face of the unanticipated surge. These approaches facilitated equitable sharing of resources across a complex healthcare-system and allowed for the rapid implementation of standardized protocols at each hospital.

AB  - In 2019, a new virus -SARS-COV2 emerged in china which infected many people affecting mainly the respiratory system. SARS-COV2 gets transmitted by inhalation of droplets from infected persons. Symptoms start to appear after the incubation period of the virus which ranges from 2 to 14 days. In most people, symptoms are usually mild such as fever, sore throat, cough, chest tightness and fatigue. In other people, the disease might progress into severe pneumonia leading to several fatal consequences. Treatment is usually supportive and the role of antiviral is not established yet. Home isolation for mild cases is important for the prevention of the transmission of infection. Although the rate of transmission of this virus is faster than other viruses from the family such as MERS-CoV, it has a lower fatality rate. The main difference in the genome structure of this family which make it distinguishable from other viruses is its use of (+) ssRNA as its genetic material which is comprised of 5' cap located at one end and 3' polyadenylation tract at the other end. During infection of an exposed host cell, viral-encoded protease cleaves the polyprotein that results from translation of 5' open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, culminating in releasing of multiple nonstructural proteins such as helicase (Hel), adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rep). These proteins are responsible for the replication process in addition to the syntheses of the sub genomic mRNA used as transcription templet strand. In this review article we discussed the transmission pathways, genetic sequence and current treatment approach of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The nucleotide analogue prodrug remdesivir was among the first antiviral therapies to be tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for COVID-19. We performed a meta-analysis to understand efficacy and safety. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases (from January 1, 2020 to November 5, 2020). We included RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of remdesivir to control/placebo in COVID-19. Two independent investigators abstracted data, assessed the quality of evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 4 RCTs with 7334 patients with COVID-19 were included. At a follow-up of 28-29 days from randomization, very low certainty evidence showed that use of remdesivir compared with control group (placebo and/or standard of care) was not associated with a significant decrease in time to clinical improvement (standardized mean difference -0.80 day; [CI, -2.12, 0.53]). However, moderate certainty of evidence showed that remdesivir was associated with higher rates of recovered patients (risk difference [RD] 0.07 [0.05, 0.08]) and discharged patients (RD 0.07 [0.03, 0.11]) and lower rates of developing serious adverse events (RD -0.05 [-0.10, -0.01]) compared with control. Moderate and very low certainty of evidence showed there was no significant difference in deaths at 28-29 days follow-up (RD -0.01 [-0.03, 0.01]) and developing any adverse events (RD 0.01 [-0.17, 0.19]) between both groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients given remdesivir are more likely to demonstrate recovery and were associated with higher rates of hospital discharge, but not with significant reduction in mean time to clinical improvement or mortality.

AB  - The new type of corona virus (SARS-COV-2) emerging in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly to the world and has become a pandemic. In addition to having a significant impact on daily life, it also shows its effect in different areas, including public health and economy. Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral drug available to prevent the COVID-19 disease. Therefore, determination of protein interactions of new types of corona virus is vital in clinical studies, drug therapy, identification of preclinical compounds and protein functions. Protein-protein interactions are important to examine protein functions and pathways involved in various biological processes and to determine the cause and progression of diseases. Various high-throughput experimental methods have been used to identify protein-protein interactions in organisms, yet, there is still a huge gap in specifying all possible protein interactions in an organism. In addition, since the experimental methods used include cloning, labeling, affinity purification mass spectrometry, the processes take a long time. Determining these interactions with artificial intelligence-based methods rather than experimental approaches may help to identify protein functions faster. Thus, protein-protein interaction prediction using deep-learning algorithms has been employed in conjunction with experimental method to explore new protein interactions. However, to predict protein interactions with artificial intelligence techniques, protein sequences need to be mapped. There are various types and numbers of protein-mapping methods in the literature. In this study, we wanted to contribute to the literature by proposing a novel protein-mapping method based on the AVL tree. The proposed method was inspired by the fast search performance on the dictionary structure of AVL tree and was used to verify the protein interactions between SARS-COV-2 virus and human. First, protein sequences were mapped by both the proposed method and various protein-mapping methods. Then, the mapped protein sequences were normalized and classified by bidirectional recurrent neural networks. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated with accuracy, f1-score, precision, recall, and AUC scores. Our results indicated that our mapping method predicts the protein interactions between SARS-COV-2 virus proteins and human proteins at an accuracy of 97.76%, precision of 97.60%, recall of 98.33%, f1-score of 79.42%, and with AUC 89% in average.

AB  - The COVID-19 being a preconized global pandemic by the World Health Organization needs persuasive immediate research for possible medications. The present study was carried out with a specific aim to computationally evaluate and identify compounds derived from Bacillus species as the plausible inhibitors against 3-chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro) or main protease (MPro), which is a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus. The compounds were isolated from the crude extracts of Bacillus species. Among the isolated compounds, novel inhibitory leads were identified using in silico techniques. Molecular docking revealed that stigmasterol (-8.3 kcal/mol), chondrillasterol (-7.9 kcal/mol) and hexadecnoic acid (-6.9 kcal/mol)) among others bind in the substrate-binding pocket and also interacted with the catalytic dyad of the 3-CLpro. Further evaluation using 50 ns molecular dynamic simulation and MMPB-GBSA indicated that among the top three docking hits, hexadecanoic acid was found to be the most promising anti-COVID-19 lead against the main protease. Hexadecanoic acid might serve as a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound to combat COVID-19, however, in vitro and in vivo validation and optimization is needed. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proven to be used by SARS-CoV-2 for host cell entry. Considering that angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) upregulate the expression of ACE2 in animal studies, there may be a concern about whether these drugs may increase COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Recently, there has been a debate among clinicians about whether to continue or to stop ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers in the context of COVID-19. Also, some media outlets and health systems have called for the discontinuation of these drugs in the context of suspected COVID-19. This has necessitated an urgent release of guidance on the use of such medications in COVID-19 patients. To date, multiple theories relating to the pure effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on COVID-19 infections have been postulated. Favorable effects include blocking the ACE2 receptors, preventing viral entry into the heart and lungs, and protecting against lung injury in COVID-19. Adverse effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism that upregulates ACE2 receptors. This review provides greater insight into the role of the RAAS axis in acute lung injury and the effects of RAAS inhibitors on SARS-CoVs. The hypothesis that RAAS inhibitors facilitate viral insertion and the alternative hypothesis of the beneficial role of these drugs are discussed. Up-to-date published data concerning the RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 are summarized.

AB  - Italy was the first country after China to be affected by COVID-19. The wave of the emergency found our country unprepared to cope with the surge of patients going to first aid departments to seek assistance in the almost complete paralysis of community health. Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) can effectively contribute to, and improve the effectiveness of, a pandemic response working on several key areas: training, adapting workflows and processes, restructuring teams and tasks, effective mechanisms and tools for communication, engaging patients and families and learning from failures and successes. In Italy, HFE expertise has been able to provide our healthcare systems with some easy-to-realize solutions (particularly dedicated to improving communication, team work and situational awareness) in order to cope with the need for rapid adaptations to new and unknown scenarios: ensuring information and communication continuity in the different levels of the healthcare system; identifying hazard opportunity through risk management tool; providing training through simulation; organizing regular briefing and debriefing; enhancing the reporting and learning system as an informal way of communicating adverse events and supporting information campaign and education initiatives for the public.

AB  - This Essay reflects on how socio-spatial inequalities and geographic situations condition the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, as well as actions to deal with the pandemic, with arguments backed by the literature. Socio-spatial inequality is defined as a process and structural condition of a territory marked by inherited and updated vulnerabilities, resulting from a relationship of exploitation, spoliation, and oppression in the current period of globalization. The authors argue that the COVID-19 pandemic can have more serious repercussions in contexts of greater socio-spatial inequality, with systemic and chronic deepening of the economic and social crises in places. Still, actions matter, including collaboration between different groups, institutions, and sectors. The analysis of geographic situation contributes to understanding the inherited territory and different experiences with COVID-19, inextricably linked to the conditions and meanings of action in the face of the pandemic in each place. Geographic situation expresses the tension between freedom and the condition for action. The crisis is not only a health crisis, but a manifestation of the current time, and inequality proves to be the most serious emergency of the 21st century.

AB  - Background: There is currently a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The intensity and duration of this first and second waves in the UK may be dependent on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmits more effectively in the winter than the summer and the UK Government response is partially built upon the assumption that those infected will develop immunity to reinfection in the short term. In this paper we examine evidence for seasonality and immunity to laboratory-confirmed seasonal coronavirus (HCoV) from a prospective cohort study in England. Methods: In this analysis of the Flu Watch cohort, we examine seasonal trends for PCR-confirmed coronavirus infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E) in all participants during winter seasons (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009) and during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (May-Sep 2009). We also included data from the pandemic and 'post-pandemic' winter seasons (2009-2010 and 2010-2011) to identify individuals with two confirmed HCoV infections and examine evidence for immunity against homologous reinfection. Results: We tested 1,104 swabs taken during respiratory illness and detected HCoV in 199 during the first four seasons. The rate of confirmed HCoV infection across all seasons was 390 (95% CI 338-448) per 100,000 person-weeks; highest in the Nov-Mar 2008/9 season at 674 (95%CI 537-835) per 100,000 person-weeks. The highest rate was in February at 759 (95% CI 580-975) per 100,000 person-weeks. Data collected during May-Sep 2009 showed there was small amounts of ongoing transmission, with four cases detected during this period. Eight participants had two confirmed infections, of which none had the same strain twice. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that HCoV infection in England is most intense in winter, but that there is a small amount of ongoing transmission during summer periods. We found some evidence of immunity against homologous reinfection.

However, subgroup analysis of ACTT-1 Study Group showed an apparent reduction in mortality for patients who required non‑high-flow oxygen. Presentation of SOLIDARITY study results were associated by a meta-analysis combining mortality results by subsets rom randomized clinical trials. The aim is a methodological assessment of reliability and clinical applicability about findings by subgroups on the effect of remdesivir on mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A validated tool was used to evaluate the findings of subgroup analyses in randomized clinical trials, including meta-analysis atached to SOLIDARITY study. It is structured in preliminary questions to reject subset analyses without relevant minimum conditions, and a specific checklist. The latter considers certain criteria: statistical association, which encompassed p of interaction, prespecification of subgroups, sample size, number of factors analyzed, and overall study result; biological plausibility of observed differences; and consistency between results of similar studies. A score was assigned to each criterion and the tool related global summation to a recommendation on the applicability of subset results in clinical decision making. RESULTS: Preliminary questions had positive answers, so checklist was applied. Statistical association obtained "null" assessment (-3 points), including a "doubtful" p of interaction (p = 0.0650) among subgroups and mortality reached no statistical significance for global population. These findings reduced the reliability of subset analysis. Biological plausibility was considered "probable" (+3 points) because antiviral could have a greater effect before the inflammatory process and clinical worsening. Consistency between results of similar studies was evaluated as "possible" (+2 points) analysis for compatibility of ACTT-1 and SOLIDARITY study results. The recommendation about application of subset analysis results according to the risk of patients was "null". CONCLUSIONS: This structured interpretation of subgroup analysis suggested too much uncertainty in hypothesis about remdesivir could reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 who required non-high- flow oxygen. It was probably a random finding. Therefore, a randomized clinical trial about effect of remdesivir in mortality in patients with COVID‑19 and non-high-flow oxygen is essential.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection was announced as a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, several scientists have focused on the low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings led to our hypothesis that the Nicotinic Cholinergic System (NCS) plays a crucial role in the manifestation of COVID-19 and its severe symptoms. Molecular modeling revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein might bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) through a cryptic epitope homologous to snake toxins, substrates well documented and known for their affinity to the nAChRs. This binding model could provide logical explanations for the acute inflammatory disorder in patients with COVID-19, which may be linked to severe dysregulation of NCS. In this study, we present a series of complexes with cholinergic agonists that can potentially prevent SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein from binding to nAChRs, avoiding dysregulation of the NCS and moderating the symptoms and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. If our hypothesis is verified by in vitro and in vivo studies, repurposing agents currently approved for smoking cessation and neurological conditions could provide the scientific community with a therapeutic option in severe COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS) is an uncommon immune-mediated entity characterized by myositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), non-erosive arthritis, and less common features such as fever, Raynaud's phenomenon, and skin changes in association with anti-aminoacyl-transfer-RNA antibodies, most commonly anti-Jo-1 antibodies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a challenging and rare case of ASS-associated ILD presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. High clinical suspicion for ASS with early appropriate therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents led to marked clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion for ASS is mandated in patients with unexplained ILD. A comprehensive autoimmune work-up is important as an early treatment with corticosteroids with or without immunomodulators improves patient outcomes and survival in an otherwise poor prognostic disease.

AB  - Coronaviruses M proteins are well-represented in the major protein component of the viral envelope. During the viral assembly, they play an important role by association with all other viral structural proteins. Despite their crucial functions, very little information regarding the structures and functions of M proteins is available. Here we utilize bioinformatic tools from available sequences and 3D structures of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV2, and MERS-CoV M proteins in order to predict potential B-cell epitopes and assessing antibody binding affinity. Such study aims to aid finding more effective vaccines and recognize neutralizing antibodies. we found some rather exciting differences between SARS-COV-2, SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV M proteins. Two SARS-CoV-2 peptides with significant antigen presentation scores for human cell surface proteins have been identified. The results reveal that N-terminal domains of M proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are translocated (outside) whereas it is inside (cytoplasmic side) in MERS-CoV.

AB  - Ripretinib is a recently developed drug for the treatment of adults with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This paper reports an attempt to study this molecule by electronic modeling and molecular mechanics to determine its composition and other specific chemical features via the density-functional theory (DFT), thereby affording sufficient information on the electronic properties and descriptors that can enable the estimation of its molecular bioactivity. We explored most of the physico-chemical properties of the molecule, as well as its stabilization, via the studies of the natural bond orbitals and noncovalent interactions. The electronic excitation, which is a time-dependent process, was examined by the time-dependent DFT with a CAM-B3LYP functional. The molecular docking study indicated that Ripretinib strongly docks with three known novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-n-CoV-2) proteins with a reasonably good docking score.

AB  - Full attention must be given to the follow-up of patients recovered from Coronavirus disease 2019, which developed in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Among the most serious issues since the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has been whether those who had it can experience a second episode of infection and what that implies for immunity. The earlier studies on COVID-19 disease focused primarily on the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients with COVID-19. However, conclusions of these studies still require to be warranted by more careful design, larger sample size and statistically well structured studies. COVID-19 is an under-studied infection, and several aspects of viral transmission and clinical progress remain at present unclear. There is a concern about the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces and in the respiratory system of patients who have survived. One of the most concerning issues since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 is persistence in patients and whether patients can be re-infected. After hospital discharge, recovered patients were reported to have positive SARS-CoV-2 test in China, Japan, and South Korea. In addition to the persistence of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may occur in survivors. In this paper, we focused on the evidence of persistence and re-infection of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Telehealth has been increasingly used to expand healthcare access over the last two decades. However, this had not been the case for palliative care (PC), because telehealth was considered nontraditional and impractical due to the sensitive nature of conversations and a "high touch" philosophy. Motivated by limited PC access to rural and underserved populations and positive PC telehealth studies, clinical PC telehealth models have been developing. However, nearly overnight, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use and uptake of telehealth across health care and especially in PC. As a result, clinicians, administrators, and others agree that telehealth is "here to stay," and will likely maintain widespread use and refinement beyond rural areas. The purpose of this review is to describe exemplar PC telehealth programs in research and clinical practice, including pros and cons, lessons learned, and future directions for the ongoing development and expansion of PC via telehealth across diseases and the lifespan.

AB  - Since its identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in 46 million cases and more than one million deaths worldwide, as of 30 October 2020. Limited data exist on the magnitude and durability of antibodies generated by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and whether they can provide long-lasting immunity from reinfection. Vaccination has proven the most effective measure for controlling and preventing pandemics and, thus, development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is a top priority. However, the doses required to induce effective, long-lasting antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 remain undetermined. Here, we present the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates encoding the viral spike (S) gene, generated using plasmid (p)DNA technology, and we demonstrate the eliciting of S-specific antibodies in mice after three and four doses. The magnitude of binding and neutralizing antibody responses with three doses of synthetic, codon-optimized, full-length S (S.opt.FL) vaccine is comparable to that generated after four doses, suggesting that three doses are sufficient to elicit robust immune responses. Conversely, four doses of S1.opt pDNA vaccine, containing the S globular head, are required to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, the S.opt.FL pDNA vaccine induces the highest serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, a marker for activation of cellular immune responses. Overall, our data show that three doses of S.FL pDNA vaccine elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses, with preclinical data that support the immunogenicity of these COVID-19 vaccine candidates and provide justification for further translational studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health care systems have been dramatically affected by COVID-19. Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). RESULTS: Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question n° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question n° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question n° 8). CONCLUSIONS: When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered.

AB  - The acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2, known as COVID-19, has been ruthlessly tormenting the world population for more than six months. However, so far no effective drug or vaccine against this plague have emerged yet, despite the huge effort in course by researchers and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Willing to contribute with this fight to defeat COVID-19, we performed a virtual screening study on a library containing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, in a search for molecules capable of hitting three main molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 currently available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results were refined with further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM-PBSA calculations and pointed to 7 multi-target hits which we propose here for experimental evaluation and repurposing as potential drugs against COVID-19. Additional rounds of docking, MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations with remdesivir suggested that this compound can also work as a multi-target drug against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Aims: Our primary objective is to investigate the baseline status of patients' awareness, knowledge, and attitudes to patient safety. The secondary objective of this research is to determine factors that influence patients' knowledge regarding patient safety. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study with a targeted sample of 410 patients at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Self-administered paper-based questionnaires were distributed to outpatient clinics on February 2, 2019 until March 20, 2019. Finally, the data were analyzed by (SPSS). Results: There were 450 questioners distributed, and 410 were completed and returned (91% response rate). Most of the patients were below the age of 50 (77.9%), 54.8%, of them were females, and almost half received higher education (54.1%). Among the respondents who are taking drugs, 21.6% do not have any knowledge about the side effects of their drugs, and 47.8% of patients said that their physicians do not tell them the side effects of their prescribed drugs. Whereas 20.7% of patients claimed that they experienced a medical error, 66.3% did not report the errors, and the reason was not knowing how to report or to whom in 54.4% of the patients. In regards of infection control, 47% of the participants misunderstood means to prevent the spread of the infections and how it could be transmitted. Conclusion: Patients' knowledge about patient safety need to be improved. We suggest educating the patients by providing training programs for patients, and we recommend further studies.

AB  - Today's societies are connected to a level that has never been seen before. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of such an unprecedently connected world. As of 19 November 2020, over 56 million people have been infected with nearly 1.35 million deaths, and the numbers are growing. The state-of-the-art social media analytics for COVID-19-related studies to understand the various phenomena happening in our environment are limited and require many more studies. This paper proposes a software tool comprising a collection of unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) machine learning and other methods for the analysis of Twitter data in Arabic with the aim to detect government pandemic measures and public concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is described in detail, including its architecture, five software components, and algorithms. Using the tool, we collect a dataset comprising 14 million tweets from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the period 1 February 2020 to 1 June 2020. We detect 15 government pandemic measures and public concerns and six macro-concerns (economic sustainability, social sustainability, etc.), and formulate their information-structural, temporal, and spatio-temporal relationships. For example, we are able to detect the timewise progression of events from the public discussions on COVID-19 cases in mid-March to the first curfew on 22 March, financial loan incentives on 22 March, the increased quarantine discussions during March-April, the discussions on the reduced mobility levels from 24 March onwards, the blood donation shortfall late March onwards, the government's 9 billion SAR (Saudi Riyal) salary incentives on 3 April, lifting the ban on five daily prayers in mosques on 26 May, and finally the return to normal government measures on 29 May 2020. These findings show the effectiveness of the Twitter media in detecting important events, government measures, public concerns, and other information in both time and space with no earlier knowledge about them.

AB  - Background Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritic, dry, and eczematous lesions. The effect of atopic dermatitis on the quality of patients' lives has been investigated. However, its impact on the quality of sleep is still controversial. Objective This study aims to identify the correlation between sleep quality and atopic dermatitis disease among adults living in Saudi Arabia. Design and setting This is a cross-sectional, quantitative survey study, carried out during July and August 2020, which included atopic dermatitis patients. The study used Arabic versions of a self-administered, Internet-based questionnaire of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Face-to-face patient interviews were not applicable due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 400 patients participated in this survey study. Eighty-six percent (86%) were females while 39.6% were in the age group of 18 to 25 years old. A third of the responders could not sleep within half an hour, and a third of them woke up at night or early in the morning more than three times a week. Twenty-three point eight percent (23.8%) of the responders rated their sleep quality as a very good quality of sleep while 17.8% rated it as very bad. Inability to get to sleep within half an hour (p-value=0.002), waking up at night (p-value=0.005), and not being able to sleep because of pain (p-value<0.001) were all significantly correlated to the occurrence of many or a lot of skin symptoms of atopic dermatitis. There was a significantly higher total score among patients with atopic dermatitis (p value<0.001), which shows a poorer quality of sleep. Conclusion Symptoms of atopic dermatitis negatively influence the quality of sleep of adults in Saudi Arabia. The frequency of symptoms are significantly correlated to the poor quality of sleep. Therefore, we suggest that the evaluation of sleep quality is necessary for the management of atopic dermatitis patients.

AB  - The 2019 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus Diseases (COVID-19) has posed a substantial threat to public health and major global economic losses. The Northern Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (NEUAE) had imposed intense preventive lockdown measures. On the first of April 2020, a lockdown was implemented. It was assumed, due to lower emissions, that the air quality and Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) had been strengthened significantly. In this research, three parameters for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and SUHII variables were examined through the NEUAE. we evaluated the percentage of the change in these parameters as revealed by satellite data for 2 cycles in 2019 (March 1st to June 30th) and 2020 (March 1st to June 30th). The core results showed that during lockdown periods, the average of NO2, AOD, and SUHII levels declined by 23.7%, 3.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Validation for results demonstrates a high agreement between the predicted and measured values. The agreement was as high as R2=0.7, R2=0.6, and R2=0.68 for NO2, AOD, and night LST, respectively, indicating significant positive linear correlations. The current study concludes that due to declining automobile and industrial emissions in the NEUAE, the lockdown initiatives substantially lowered NO2, AOD, and SUHII. In addition, the aerosols did not alter significantly since they are often linked to the natural occurrence of dust storms throughout this time of the year. The pandemic is likely to influence several policy decisions to introduce strategies to control air pollution and SUHII. Lockdown experiences may theoretically play a key role in the future as a possible solution for air pollution and SUHII abatement.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that appeared in China in December 2019, in recent years, great progress has been made in developing new antiviral drugs, and natural products, are important sources of potential and new antiviral drugs. The present study aimed to assess some biologically active compounds present in medicinal plants as potential COVID-19 inhibitors, using molecular docking methods. The Docking study was performed by Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE). About 20 Compounds were screened in this study; these compounds were selected based on classification of their chemical origin and their antiviral activity from literature. These compounds might be used to inhibit COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this screening strategy, which can lead to rapid drug discovery in response to new infectious diseases. The results showed that many compounds isolated from medicinal plants such as; Gallic acid (- 17.45), Quercetin (- 15.81), Naringin (- 14.50), Capsaicin (- 13.90), and Psychotrine (- 13.5) are important sources for novel antiviral drugs targeting COVID-19.

AB  - In confronting the global spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic we must have coordinated medical, operational, and political responses. In all efforts, data is crucial. Fundamentally, and in the possible absence of a vaccine for 12 to 18 months, we need universal, well-documented testing for both the presence of the disease as well as confirmed recovery through serological tests for antibodies, and we need to track major socioeconomic indices. But we also need auxiliary data of all kinds, including data related to how populations are talking about the unfolding pandemic through news and stories. To in part help on the social media side, we curate a set of 2000 day-scale time series of 1- and 2-grams across 24 languages on Twitter that are most 'important' for April 2020 with respect to April 2019. We determine importance through our allotaxonometric instrument, rank-turbulence divergence. We make some basic observations about some of the time series, including a comparison to numbers of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 over time. We broadly observe across all languages a peak for the language-specific word for 'virus' in January 2020 followed by a decline through February and then a surge through March and April. The world's collective attention dropped away while the virus spread out from China. We host the time series on Gitlab, updating them on a daily basis while relevant. Our main intent is for other researchers to use these time series to enhance whatever analyses that may be of use during the pandemic as well as for retrospective investigations.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly growing infectious disease, widely spread with high mortality rates. Since the release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence in March 2020, there has been an international focus on developing target-based drug discovery, which also requires knowledge of the 3D structure of the proteome. Where there are no experimentally solved structures, our group has created 3D models with coverage of 97.5% and characterized them using state-of-the-art computational approaches. Models of protomers and oligomers, together with predictions of substrate and allosteric binding sites, protein-ligand docking, SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions with human proteins, impacts of mutations, and mapped solved experimental structures are freely available for download. These are implemented in SARS CoV-2 3D, a comprehensive and user-friendly database, available at https://sars3d.com/. This provides essential information for drug discovery, both to evaluate targets and design new potential therapeutics.

AB  - Introduction: Substance use disorder has been frequently reported to increase the risk of infectious diseases, which might be owing to the sharing of contaminated inhalation, smoking, vaping, or injection equipment. Aim: This review analyzes the recent literature with the aim to put in light the possible relationship between the abuse of different substances (Tobacco, opioid, and Alcohol) with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Tobacco: Multiple studies confirmed that cigarette smoking affects the respiratory system by increasing the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors, which have a significant association with COVID-19 infection rate and disease severity. Opioid: Studies conducted regarding the association of opioid use disorder (OUD) and COVID-19 infection severity are limited; however, opioids can lead to both respiratory depression and kidney injuries, causing poor prognosis for those with COVID-19 infections. Alcohol: People with alcohol use disorders are at risk of developing acute lung injury and severe COVID-19 infection. Alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic has two possible scenarios: either increased or decreased based on situations. Conclusion: SUD has been frequently reported to have a positive relationship with COVID-19 severity Further studies are needed to understand the effects of opioids and alcohol abuse on COVID-19.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide in 2020, populations, authorities, and local and global health governance institutions have been affected differently. Global Health Diplomacy and "paradiplomacy" have become relevant instruments and arenas for the challenges raised by the pandemic, especially for non-State or subnational actors. This Essay analyzes the case of the Brazilian state of Maranhao during the pandemic, which used a "wartime operation" to purchase more than a hundred mechanical ventilators on the international market, over the Federal Government's head, at a moment of fierce international competition for medical supplies and equipment. The Essay examines the principal aspects, contexts, reasons, factors, actors, and actions that contextualize the operation conducted by the state of Maranhao as an activity in paradiplomacy and Global Health Diplomacy by a subnational government in Brazil. We analyzed these concepts in light of the literature on the topic and studied the action by Maranhao based on cross-analysis of data from documents, statements, and news coverage. We conclude that the case of Maranhao illustrates the capacity of subnational bodies to respond to global emergencies, mainly in contexts of inefficacy or absence of the Federal executive, legitimizing independent action aimed at saving lives.

AB  - The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed as one of the major drug targets for COVID-19. We have identified the experimental data on the inhibitory activity of compounds tested against the closely related (96 % sequence identity, 100 % active site conservation) Mpro of SARS-CoV. We developed QSAR models of these inhibitors and employed these models for virtual screening of all drugs in the DrugBank database. Similarity searching and molecular docking were explored in parallel, but docking failed to correctly discriminate between experimentally active and inactive compounds, so it was not relied upon for prospective virtual screening. Forty-two compounds were identified by our models as consensus computational hits. Subsequent to our computational studies, NCATS reported the results of experimental screening of their drug collection in SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/). Coincidentally, NCATS tested 11 of our 42 hits, and three of them, cenicriviroc (AC50 of 8.9 μM), proglumetacin (tested twice independently, with AC50 of 8.9 μM and 12.5 μM), and sufugolix (AC50 12.6 μM), were shown to be active. These observations support the value of our modeling approaches and models for guiding the experimental investigations of putative anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. All data and models used in this study are publicly available via Supplementary Materials, GitHub (https://github.com/alvesvm/sars-cov-mpro), and Chembench web portal (https://chembench.mml.unc.edu/).

AB  - Coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. From cases first recorded in China at the end of 2019, a new type of virus in this family, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered. The disease caused by this virus, COVID-19, was brought into Brazil by people in social classes with greater purchasing power, but groups with larger demographic dimensions have tended to become more affected over time. Poor sanitation can generate risky situations and behavior among people who live in spaces with characteristics that limit their quality of life. Installation of piped water in homes and basic education for the population are fundamental measures for disease control, including in relation to COVID-19. In this updating article, the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed in the context of iniquities in Brazil (comparing these with the situation in other countries). A bibliographic search of texts relating to basic sanitation, socioeconomic development and transmission of COVID-19 in Brazil and worldwide was conducted.

AB  - The p53 transcription factor plays a key role both in cancer and in the cell-intrinsic response to infections. The ORFEOME project hypothesized that novel p53-virus interactions reside in hitherto uncharacterized, unknown, or hypothetical open reading frames (orfs) of human viruses. Hence, 172 orfs of unknown function from the emerging viruses SARS-Coronavirus, MERS-Coronavirus, influenza, Ebola, Zika (ZIKV), Chikungunya and Kaposi Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) were de novo synthesized, validated and tested in a functional screen of p53 signaling. This screen revealed novel mechanisms of p53 virus interactions and two viral proteins KSHV orf10 and ZIKV NS2A binding to p53. Originally identified as the target of small DNA tumor viruses, these experiments reinforce the notion that all viruses, including RNA viruses, interfere with p53 functions. These results validate this resource for analogous systems biology approaches to identify functional properties of uncharacterized viral proteins, long non-coding RNAs and micro RNAs.

AB  - Since COVID-19 was first discovered, it exploded into a pandemic resulting in devastating effects on human lives and a global recession. While there have been discussions that COVID-19 will accelerate the 'end of globalization and multilateralism', we have already seen the high costs of non-cooperation in responding to the virus resulting in sub-optimal use of resources, rapid spread of the virus between countries, and, ultimately, significant loss of life. In spite of their favorable demographic structures and relatively young populations, countries in the Global South are still harshly affected in both epidemiological and economic terms. Nations must find innovative ways to address health concerns and regional bodies are possible mechanisms for facilitating international cooperation on health. We delineate how regional organizations can support how countries address health threats namely by serving as a bridge between the global and national policy levels; strengthening disease surveillance; mobilizing supply chains and facilitating trade; supporting the production and procurement of medicines and supplies; and coordinating policies and work with other actors. We finalize by arguing that mechanisms for regional cooperation must be strengthened themselves in order to effectively contribute to positive health outcomes within member states.

AB  - Abstract: The entire world is affected by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is spreading worldwide in a short time. India is one of the countries which is affected most, therefore, the Government of India has implemented several lockdowns in the entire country from April 25, 2020. We studied air pollutants (i.e., PM2.5, Black Carbon (BC), and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) level, and observed significantly sudden reduced. In India, most of the anthropogenic activities completely stopped. Therefore, we studied the levels of BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations, their sources apportion, and health risk assessment during normal days, lockdown (from lockdown 1.0 to lockdown 4.0) and unlock down 1.0 situation at Sakchi, Jamshedpur city. It was observed that lockdowns and unlock down situations BC, PAHs and PM2.5 concentrations were significantly lower than regular days. We applied the advanced air mass back trajectory (AMBT) model to locate airborne particulate matter dispersal from different directions to strengthen the new result. The diagnostic ratio analyses of BC shows that wood burning contribution was too high during the lockdown situations. However, during normal days, the PAHs source profile was dedicated toward biomass, coal burning, and vehicle emission as primary sources of PAHs. During the lockdown period, emission from biomass and coal burning was a significant contributor to PAHs. The summaries of health risk assessment of BC quantified an equal number of passively smoked cigarettes (PSC) for an individual situation was studied. This study focuses on the overall climate impact of pandemic situations. Graphic abstract:

AB  - As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has progressed, a large volume of literature has developed delineating the clinical manifestations of acute infection. Recent reports have also started to describe persistent symptoms extending beyond the period of initial illness or hospitalization. Anecdotes of different signs and symptoms occurring after acute infection have also arisen in the lay press. Here we describe the current existing medical literature on the emerging concept of postacute COVID-19 and suggest an approach to classifying different manifestations of the syndrome. We also review long-term clinical manifestations observed in patients who recovered from infection due to other epidemic coronaviruses and briefly discuss potential mechanisms driving the phenomenon of postacute COVID-19.

AB  - Main protease (Mpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) intervenes in the replication and transcription processes of the virus. Hence, it is a lucrative target for anti-viral drug development. In this study, molecular modeling analyses were performed on the structure activity data of recently reported diverse SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors to understand the structural requirements for higher inhibitory activity. The classification-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were generated between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitory activities and different descriptors. Identification of structural fingerprints to increase or decrease in the inhibitory activity was mapped for possible inclusion/exclusion of these fingerprints in the lead optimization process. Challenges in ADME properties of protease inhibitors were also discussed to overcome the problems of oral bioavailability. Further, depending on the modeling results, we have proposed novel as well as potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity worsens clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to measure the association between history of bariatric surgery and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data source included PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and pre-print servers between January and November 1, 2020. Literature was screened and selected to extract the relevant data. The two outcomes of this meta-analysis were the difference in mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without history of bariatric surgery. Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled effects. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 3 retrospective studies on 9022 patients. The risk of mortality without previous bariatric surgery was 133 per 1000 cases and its risk with previous bariatric surgery was 33 per 1000 (summary OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I2 = 0%, P = 0.98 for heterogeneity). In the pooled analysis, the hospitalization rate in patients without previous bariatric surgery was 412 per 1000 cases and its rate in patients with previous bariatric surgery was 164 per 1000 (summary OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.65). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I2 = 0%, P = 0.71 for heterogeneity). There was a substantial risk of bias across the studies for confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSION: Findings of this meta-analysis of observational studies suggest that prior bariatric surgery is associated with a lower rate of mortality and hospital admission in patients with obesity who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies with better quality data.

AB  - In the ongoing pandemic, death statistics influence people's feelings and government policy. But when does COVID-19 qualify as the cause of death? As philosophers of medicine interested in conceptual clarification, we address the question by analyzing the World Health Organization's rules for the certification of death. We show that for COVID-19, WHO rules take into account both facts (causal chains) and values (the importance of prevention).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While much of the literature on homelessness is centred on the experience of men, women make up over one-quarter of Canada's homeless population. Research has shown that women experiencing homelessness are often hidden (i.e. provisionally housed) and have different pathways into homelessness and different needs as compared to men. The objective of this research is to identify evidence-based interventions and best practices to better support women experiencing or at risk of homelessness. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review with a gender and equity analysis. This involved searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and other databases for systematic reviews and randomized trials, supplementing our search through reference scanning and grey literature, followed by a qualitative synthesis of the evidence that examined gender and equity considerations. RESULTS: Of the 4102 articles identified on homelessness interventions, only 4 systematic reviews and 9 randomized trials were exclusively conducted on women or published disaggregated data enabling a gender analysis. Interventions with the strongest evidence included post-shelter advocacy counselling for women experiencing homelessness due to intimate partner violence, as well as case management and permanent housing subsidies (e.g. tenant-based rental assistance vouchers), which were shown to reduce homelessness, food insecurity, exposure to violence and psychosocial distress, as well as promote school stability and child well-being. CONCLUSION: Much of the evidence on interventions to better support women experiencing homelessness focusses on those accessing domestic violence or family shelters. Since many more women are experiencing or at risk of hidden homelessness, population-based strategies are also needed to reduce gender inequity and exposure to violence, which are among the main structural drivers of homelessness among women.

AB  - The current pandemic represents unprecedented times in medical education. In addition to the already strenuous demands of medical school, the SARS-CoVid-2 pandemic introduced a new source of ethical and moral pressure on students. Medical students navigated finishing their didactic years in isolation and initiated their clinical rotations in a pandemic environment. Many medical students found themselves in the frustrating position of being non-essential healthcare workers but still wanting to help. This paper follows the personal and shared experiences of a second-year medical student transitioning to their third year. In particular, this paper examines the author's personal ties to the disability community through their family, and how this impacted their approach in striving to aid in the pandemic.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originally appeared in China in December 2019 and became a global pandemic in March 2020. This infectious disease has directly affected public health and the world economy. Several palliative therapeutic treatments and prophylaxis strategies have been used to control the progress of this viral infection, including pre-(PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis. On the other hand, research groups around the world are still studying novel drug prophylaxis and treatment using repurposing approaches, as well as vaccination options, which are in different pre-clinical and clinical testing phases. This systematic review evaluated 1,228 articles from the PubMed and Scopus indexing databases, following the Kitchenham bibliographic searching protocol, with the aim to list drug candidates, potentially approved to be used as new options for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis clinical trials and medical protocols. In searching protocol, we used the following keywords: "Covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2" or "Coronavirus or 2019 nCoV," "prophylaxis," "prophylactic," "pre-exposure," "COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 Chemoprophylaxis," "repurposed," "strategies," "clinical," "trials," "anti-SARS-CoV-2," "anti-covid-19," "Antiviral," "Therapy prevention in vitro," in cells "and" human testing. After all protocol steps, we selected 60 articles that included: 15 studies with clinical data, 22 studies that used in vitro experiments, seven studies using animal models, and 18 studies performed with in silico experiments. Additionally, we included more 22 compounds between FDA approved drugs and drug-like like molecules, which were tested in large-scale screenings, as well as those repurposed approved drugs with new mechanism of actions. The drugs selected in this review can assist clinical studies and medical guidelines on the rational repurposing of known antiviral drugs for COVID-19 prophylaxis.

AB  - National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) when personal respiratory protection is used in US occupational settings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators overwhelmed the available supply. To supplement the national inventory of N95 respirators, contingency and crisis capacity strategies were implemented and incorporated a component that endorsed the use of non-NIOSH-approved respiratory protective devices that conformed to select international standards. The development and execution of this strategy required the collaborative effort of numerous agencies. The Food and Drug Administration temporarily authorized non-NIOSH-approved international respiratory protective devices through an emergency use authorization, OSHA relaxed their enforcement guidance concerning their use in US workplaces, and NIOSH initiated a supplemental performance assessment process to verify the quality of international devices. NIOSH testing revealed that many of the non-NIOSH-approved respiratory protective devices had filtration efficiencies below 95% and substantial inconsistencies in filtration performance. This article reports the results of the NIOSH testing to date and discusses how it has contributed to continuous improvement of the crisis strategy of temporarily permitting the use of non-NIOSH-approved respirators in US occupational settings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, has provoked a global healthcare and economic crisis. The control over the spread of the disease requires an efficient and scalable laboratory-based strategy for testing the population based on multiple platforms to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis. With the onset of the pandemic, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has become a standard diagnostic tool, which has received wide clinical use. In large-scale and repeated examinations, these tests can identify infected patients with COVID-19, with their accuracy, however, dependent on many factors, while the entire process takes up to 6-8 h. Here we also describe a number of serological systems for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These are used to assess the level of population immunity in various categories of people, as well as for retrospective diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 in patients. However, the widespread use of traditional diagnostic tools in the context of the rapid spread of COVID-19 is hampered by a number of limitations. Therefore, the sharp increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 necessitates creation of new rapid, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific tests. In this regard, we focus on new laboratory technologies such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), which have proven to work well in the COVID-19 diagnostics and can become a worthy alternative to traditional laboratory-based diagnostics resources. To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system requires a combination of various types of laboratory diagnostic testing techniques, whodse sensitivity and specificity increases with the progress in the SARS-CoV-2 research. The testing strategy should be designed in such a way to provide, depending on the timing of examination and the severity of the infection in patients, large-scale and repeated examinations based on the principle: screening-monitoring-control. The search and development of new methods for rapid diagnostics of COVID-19 in laboratory, based on new analytical platforms, is still a highly important and urgent healthcare issue. In the final part of the review, special emphasis is made on the relevance of the concept of personalized medicine to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the light of the recent studies carried out to identify the causes of variation in individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of treatment.

AB  - Cannabis sativa is widely used for medical purposes and has anti-inflammatory activity. This study intended to examine the anti-inflammatory activity of cannabis on immune response markers associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inflammation. An extract fraction from C. sativa Arbel strain (FCBD) substantially reduced (dose dependently) interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 levels in an alveolar epithelial (A549) cell line. FCBD contained cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and multiple terpenes. Treatments with FCBD and a FCBD formulation using phytocannabinoid standards (FCBD:std) reduced IL-6, IL-8, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligands (CCLs) 2 and 7, and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the A549 cell line. Treatment with FCBD induced macrophage (differentiated KG1 cell line) polarization and phagocytosis in vitro, and increased CD36 and type II receptor for the Fc region of IgG (FcγRII) expression. FCBD treatment also substantially increased IL-6 and IL-8 expression in macrophages. FCBD:std, while maintaining anti-inflammatory activity in alveolar epithelial cells, led to reduced phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory IL secretion in macrophages in comparison to FCBD. The phytocannabinoid formulation may show superior activity versus the cannabis-derived fraction for reduction of lung inflammation, yet there is a need of caution proposing cannabis as treatment for COVID-19.

AB  - The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a serious threat to global public health. Although primarily, the infection causes lung injury, liver enzyme abnormalities have also been reported to occur during the course of the disease. We conducted an extensive literature review using the PubMed database on articles covering a broad range of issues related to COVID-19 and hepatic injury. The present review summarizes available information on the spectrum of liver involvement, the possible mechanisms and risk factors of liver injury due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the prognostic significance of the presence of liver injury. Hopefully, this review will enable clinicians, especially the hepatologists, to understand and manage the liver derangements they may encounter in these patients better and provide guidance for further studies on the liver injury of COVID-19.

AB  - Liver dysfunction manifesting as elevated aminotransferase levels has been a common feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. The mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 infection is unclear. However, it has been hypothesized to be a result of direct cytopathic effects of the virus, immune dysfunction and cytokine storm-related multiorgan damage, hypoxia-reperfusion injury and idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury due to medications used in the management of COVID-19. The favored hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of liver injury in the setting of COVID-19 is cytokine storm, an aberrant and unabated inflammatory response leading to hyperproduction of cytokines. In the current review, we have summarized the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms of cytokine-induced liver injury based on the reported literature.

AB  - Nonpharmaceutical interventions to minimize the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are necessary because we currently lack a vaccine or specific treatments. Healthcare facilities have adopted visitor restrictions and masking requirements. These interventions should be evaluated as public health measures, focusing on their efficacy, the availability of less-restrictive alternatives, and the minimization of the burdens and their balance with the benefits. These interventions, as well as exceptions, can be justified by the same analysis. For example, visitor restrictions are sound, as are exceptions for women in labor, adults with disabilities, minor children, and individuals who are dying. In implementing these policies, specific rules are preferable to general principles because they are more efficient and reduce possible bias. There should, however, be appeal mechanisms and retrospective review processes. Evaluating requests for medical exemptions to masking requirements is particularly difficult, given the prevalence of nonmedical objections, false claims of medical exemptions, and a lack of objective medical criteria. Requiring written statements by licensed healthcare providers that undergo subsequent substantive review may therefore be justified.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global pandemic, primarily affecting the pulmonary system and its effects on other systems are not certain. Coronavirus, the causative organism, binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lungs and produces pneumonia-like symptoms. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs produces pneumonia-like symptoms. Other than lungs, ACE2 receptors are also seen in the endothelium of blood vessels. Therefore, viruses can bind to the ACE2 endothelium of brain blood vessels and thus can invade BBB leading to neuronal damage. It is also believed that olfactory cells rich in ACE2 receptors may act as the main route of viral spread into various parts of the brain. The reported neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 include cerebrovascular diseases, ageusia and anosmia, Guillain Barre Syndrome, and viral encephalitis. The extent of neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection warrants the necessity of further research to systematically classify neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, its diagnosis, and treatment. As ACE2 receptors are present in various other organs, it is obligatory to study the effect of coronavirus on other organs. Since the long-lasting effects of the COVID-19 are unclear, more studies should be conducted to confirm the effect of the virus on the central nervous system. This review highlights the reported neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and its mechanism.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of pandemic severe respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially occurred in China, has spread the world resulted in serious threats to human public health. Uncommon neurological manifestations with pathophysiological symptoms were observed in infected patients including headache, seizures, and neuroimmunological disorders. Regardless of whether these neurological symptoms are direct or indirect casual infection relationship, this novel viral infection has a relevant impact on the neuroimmune system that requires a neurologist's careful assessment. Recently, the use of immunotherapy has been emerged in fighting against COVID-19 infection despite the uncertain efficiency in managing COVID-19 related disorders or even its proven failure by increasing its severity. Herein, the author is addressing the first approaches in using immunotherapies in controlling COVID-19 viral impact on the brain by highlighting their role in decreasing or increasing infection risks among subjects. This point of view review article supports the use of immunotherapies in managing COVID-19 neurological disorders but in optimal timing and duration to ensure the maximum therapeutic outcome by reducing morbidity and mortality rate. Based on recently published data, the current review article highlights the beneficial effects and drawbacks of using immunotherapies to combat COVID-19 and its neurological symptoms.

AB  - Background and Objective: The corona-virus (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating impacts on not only the health and socio-economic conditions but also on the education sector in various countries. Consequently, the world of education entered a new era of E-learning. This descriptive study, thus, aims to evaluate the standpoint of medical and dental undergraduates regarding E-learning amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods: A descriptive online questionnaire was used to gather responses via Google forms. The questionnaire consisted of questions categorized as technology access, online skills and relationships, students' views, and student's perception of possible advantages of E-learning. Two hundred and eighty three medical and dental students of CMH Lahore Medical College participated in the study. Results: One hundred and seventy nine female and 104 male students responded to the questionnaire. The results of the study showed students encouraging the accommodation of E-learning into current teaching practices. Students agreed online study material not only provides flexibility in the learning process (p=0.003) but also saves time (p = 0.012). Female participants showed a more positive readiness response towards e learning than males (p =0.001). Results also showed students have easier access to online teaching resources. Regarding online lectures, the students believe that online lectures were more organized (p= 0.001) and stimulated student interest (p=0.026). Students believe that frequent participation in the learning process is important for success in online education (p=0.002). Conclusion: Undergraduate medical and dental students from the said private medical college are well equipped and ready to shift towards online education.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and quickly spread worldwide and has since been assigned a pandemic status. This affected the worlds' social interactions, including within medical practices, thus interfering with routine treatments for a variety of diseases including cancer. Different studies have addressed the fact that patients with cancer are often immunocompromised, making them more susceptible to infections. Since COVID-19 frequently causes respiratory distress, patients with lung cancer are considered to be a high-risk group. Genes that have been indicated to mediate viral entry into host cells such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 are expressed in the lung tissue, a fact that could partially explain COVID-19 pathogenesis and lung involvement. Therefore, the current study offers a disease overview including molecular aspects behind the infection and provide a perspective on already published Chinese data plus recommendations for the management of lung cancer patients according to the two main lung cancer types and stages: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. This review aimed to add to the collective effort of selecting the most appropriate guidelines to follow for the treatment of these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to describe scientific evidence regarding the use of prone positioning in the care provided to patients with acute respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. METHOD: this is a scoping review. PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews was used to support the writing of this study. The search was conducted in seven databases and resulted in 2,441 studies, 12 of which compose the sample. Descriptive statistics, such as relative and absolute frequencies, was used to analyze data. RESULTS: prone positioning was mainly adopted in Intensive Care Units, lasted from a minimum of 12 up to 16 hours, and its prescription was based on specific criteria, such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. The most prevalent complications were: accidental extubation, pressure ulcer, and facial edema. Decreased hypoxemia and mortality rates were the main outcomes reported. CONCLUSION: positive outcomes outweighed complications. Various cycles of prone positioning are needed, which may cause potential work overload for the health staff. Therefore, an appropriate number of trained workers is necessary, in addition to specific institutional protocols to ensure patient safety in this context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Testing used in screening, diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 has been a subject of debate. Several organisations have developed formal advice about testing for COVID-19 to assist in the control of the disease. We collated, delineated and appraised current worldwide recommendations about the role and applications of tests to control SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. METHODS: We searched for documents providing recommendations for COVID-19 testing in PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database and relevant websites such as TRIP database, ECRI Guidelines Trust, the GIN database, from inception to 21 September 2020. Two reviewers applied the eligibility criteria to potentially relevant citations without language or geographical restrictions. We extracted data in duplicate, including assessment of methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II tool. RESULTS: We included 47 relevant documents and 327 recommendations about testing. Regarding the quality of the documents, we found that the domains with the lowest scores were 'Editorial independence' (Median=4%) and 'Applicability' (Median=6%). Only six documents obtained at least 50% score for the 'Rigour of development' domain. An important number of recommendations focused on the diagnosis of suspected cases (48%) and deisolation measures (11%). The most frequently recommended test was the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay (87 recommendations) and the chest CT (38 recommendations). There were 22 areas of agreement among guidance developers, including the use of RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 confirmation, the limited role of bronchoscopy, the use chest CT and chest X-rays for grading severity and the co-assessment for other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSION: This first scoping review of recommendations for COVID-19 testing showed many limitations in the methodological quality of included guidance documents that could affect the confidence of clinicians in their implementation. Future guidance documents should incorporate a minimum set of key methodological characteristics to enhance their applicability for decision making.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is complicated by significant coagulopathy, that manifests in the form of both pulmonary artery microthromboses and systemic venous thromboembolism (VTE) leading to excess mortality. Dysregulated innate immune response in the lung due to viral-entry mediated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature, inflammatory cytokine release, increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis. The inflammatory disease process, immobilization with prolonged hospital stay, hypoxia due to extensive lung injury and pre-existing comorbidities can contribute to thromboembolic episodes (TE). The observed risk for TE in COVID-19 is high despite anticoagulation, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A high level of clinical suspicion, lower threshold for diagnostic imaging and aggressive early and extended thromboprophylaxis is indicated. The available evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is heterogenous, but rapidly evolving. We propose an evidence-based, risk-stratified protocol in approaching the risk of TE episodes in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - In this short paper we analyse some paradoxical aspects of France's Foucauldian heritage: (1) while several French scholars claim the COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect example of what Foucault called biopolitics, popular reaction instead suggests a biopolitical failure on the part of the government; (2) One of these failures concerns the government's inability to produce reliable biostatistical data, especially regarding health inequalities in relation to COVID-19. We interrogate whether Foucaldianism contributed, in the past as well today, towards a certain myopia in France regarding biostatistics and its relation to social inequalities in health. One might ask whether this very data could provide an appropriate response to the Foucauldian question: What kind of governance of life is the pandemic revealing to us?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the Otolaryngology outpatient clinical practice, which is at high risk of respiratory viral transmission due to the close contact between the examiner and the patient's airway secretions [1]. Moreover, most otolaryngological procedures, including oropharyngoscopy, generate droplets or aerosols from high viral shedding areas [1]. Thus, only non-deferrable consultations were performed in the outbreak's acute phase. Along with the re-opening of elective clinical services and the impending second wave of the outbreak, a reorganization is necessary to minimize the risk of nosocomial transmission [1]. METHODS: This video (Video 1) shows how to safely conduct an outpatient Otorhinolaryngological consultation, focusing on complete ear, nose and throat examination, according to evidences from the published literature and Otolaryngological societies guidelines [2,3]. RESULTS: After telephonic screening, patients reporting Covid-19 symptoms or closecontact with a Covid-19 case within the last 14 days are referred to telehealth services [1-3]. To avoid crowding, the patient is admitted alone, after body temperature control, except for underage or disabled people [1]. The waiting room assessment must guarantee a social distance of 6 ft [1-3]. The consultation room is reorganized into two separate areas (Fig. 1): 1) a clean desk area, where an assistant wearing a surgical mask and gloves, handles the patient's documentation and writes the medical report, keeping proper distance from the patient, and 2) a separate consultation area, where the examiner, equipped with proper personal protective equipment (Fig. 2) [3,4], carries out the medical interview and physical examination. Endoscopic-assisted ear, nose and throat inspection using a dedicated monitor allows the examiner to maintain an adequate distance from the patient throughout the procedure while providing an optimal view (Figs. 3-6) [3]. Recent evidence shows that nasal endoscopy does not increase droplet production compared to traditional otolaryngological examination [5]. When necessary, nasal topic decongestion and anesthesia must be performed using cottonoids rather than sprays [3]. The patient keeps the nose and mouth covered throughout the consultation, lowering the surgical mask on the mouth for nasal endoscopy and removing it only for oropharyngoscopy. After the consultation, the doffing procedure must be carried out carefully to avoid contamination [4]. All the equipment and surfaces must undergo high-level disinfection with 70% alcohol or 0.1% bleach solutions [3]. Proper room ventilation must precede the next consultation [3]. CONCLUSIONS: The hints provided in this video are useful to ensure both patient and examiner safety during Otolaryngological outpatient consultations and to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

AB  - This study validated the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-SE) based on data collected from 227 adults in the United States. Results indicated that the C19P-SE has adequate reliability (α = .93) along with factorial, discriminant, and convergent validity. Results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the four-factor structure of the C19P-SE. Concurrent validity results indicate a significant positive correlation between coronaphobia and state anxiety (r = .67, p < .001), suggesting that individuals with higher levels of coronaphobia may also have higher levels of state anxiety or vice versa. Further, we found a multivariate difference in coronaphobia between men and women.

These approaches include the stimulation of the body's own repair processes, transplantation of progenitor cells, stem cells, or tissues, as well as the use of cells and exosomes as delivery-vehicles for cytokines, genes, or other therapeutic agents. COVID-19 pneumonia is a specific disease consistent with diffuse alveolar damage resulting in severe hypoxemia. Therefore, the most serious cause of death from COVID-19 is lung dysfunction. Here, we consider RM approaches to cure COVID-19 pneumonia based on what RM has so far used to treat lung diseases, injuries, or pneumonia induced by other pathogens. These approaches include stem and progenitor cell transplantation, stem cell-derived exosomes, and microRNAs therapy.

AB  - With the potentially fatal effect of COVID-19 and its devastating impact on economies worldwide, some environmental scientist has suggested the use of waste from household sewage to trace the movement of SARS-CoV-2, within a given country. However, this approach is not without challenges where developing countries lack proper and adequate hygiene and sanitation, resulting in widespread defecation. Limited scientific research has been done to determine how many times a recently infected person can defecate and the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 found in a single expel. On the other hand, there is no detailed research to specify where the heavy viral load of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in human excreta. In this paper, we present some obstacles that this approach could face in the absence of an intense lockdown in developing nations such as sub-Saharan countries. To achieve this, we identify some research needs that will strengthen our understanding of the transmission, occurrence, and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and wastewater, including the life-span that depends on temperature. A methodology to follow in the process of identifying a hotspot on a small scale using some mathematical distributions, including the normal distribution, log-normal distribution, and the most complex one known as Blancmange function, was presented with some examples. Our investigation showed that this method might have some challenges, especially in developing countries (sub-Sahara countries) where open latrine usage is very high. Some recommendations we suggested to ensure the efficiency of such a method on a small scale. However, in general, it is essential to note the extraction/detection method will not help more than the testing method used all over the world to trace SARS-CoV-2 -19 in humans.

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19, caused by novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, became a pandemic in just 10 weeks. Without effective medications or vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such as use of face masks, school's closings, shelter-in-place, telework and social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people's unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news messages.

AB  - Five years ago, the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF) conducted an assessment of the challenges and opportunities facing the melanoma research community and patients with melanoma. Since then, remarkable progress has been made on both the basic and clinical research fronts. However, the incidence, recurrence and death rates for melanoma remain unacceptably high and significant challenges remain. Hence, the MRF Scientific Advisory Council and Breakthrough Consortium, a group that includes clinicians and scientists, reconvened to facilitate intensive discussions on thematic areas essential to melanoma researchers and patients alike - prevention, detection, diagnosis, metastatic dormancy and progression, response and resistance to targeted and immune-based therapy, and the clinical consequences of COVID-19 for melanoma patients and providers. These extensive discussions helped to crystalize our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the broader melanoma community today. In this report, we discuss the progress made since the last MRF assessment, comment on what remains to be overcome and offer recommendations for the best path forward.

AB  - The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coupled with a lack of therapeutics, has paralyzed the globe. Although significant effort has been invested in identifying antibodies that block infection, the ability of antibodies to target infected cells through Fc interactions may be vital to eliminate the virus. To explore the role of Fc activity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the functional potential of a cross-SARS-reactive antibody, CR3022, was assessed. CR3022 was able to broadly drive antibody effector functions, providing critical immune clearance at entry and upon egress. Using selectively engineered Fc variants, no protection was observed after administration of WT IgG1 in mice or hamsters. Conversely, the functionally enhanced Fc variant resulted in increased pathology in both the mouse and hamster models, causing weight loss in mice and enhanced viral replication and weight loss in the more susceptible hamster model, highlighting the pathological functions of Fc-enhancing mutations. These data point to the critical need for strategic Fc engineering for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents a challenge to laboratorians and healthcare workers around the world. Handling of biological samples from individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires strict biosafety measures. Within the laboratory, non-propagative work with samples containing the virus requires, at minimum, Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) techniques and facilities. Therefore, handling of SARS-CoV-2 samples remains a major concern in areas and conditions where biosafety for specimen handling is difficult to maintain, such as in rural laboratories or austere field testing sites. Inactivation through physical or chemical means can reduce the risk of handling live virus and increase testing ability especially in low-resource settings due to easier and faster sample processing. Herein we assess several chemical and physical inactivation techniques employed against SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Cambodia. This data demonstrates that all chemical (AVL, inactivating sample buffer and formaldehyde) and heat-treatment (56 and 98 °C) methods tested completely inactivated viral loads of up to 5 log10.

AB  - Whereas the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) storm is relentlessly progressing worldwide, a great effort from scientific societies has been made to give recommendations for safely continuing oncological care, prioritizing the interventions according to patients' condition and type and stage of tumor. Nevertheless, to date no specific suggestions regarding physical activity and exercise in cancer patients during the COVID-19 era have been released, neglecting the potential deleterious effects of quarantine and sedentary behaviour (imposed as containment measures against COVID-19), particularly in these subjects. Moreover, literature is constantly consolidating the crucial impact of regular physical activity in cancer in reducing recurrence and mortality risk. In this commentary, we discuss possible adaptations of the recently published exercise guidelines to the current pandemic emergency, proposing various modalities to prevent or mitigate the physical inactivity risk in cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild, but patients can present with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and circulatory shock. Although the symptoms of the disease are predominantly respiratory, the involvement of the cardiovascular system is common. Patients with heart failure (HF) are particularly vulnerable when suffering from COVID-19. AIM OF THE REVIEW: To examine the challenges faced by healthcare organizations, and mechanical circulatory support management strategies available to patients with heart failure, during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be lifesaving in patients with severe forms of ARDS, or refractory cardio-circulatory compromise. The Impella RP can provide right ventricular circulatory support for patients who develop right side ventricular failure or decompensation caused by COVID-19 complications, including pulmonary embolus. HT are reserved for only those patients with a high short-term mortality. LVAD as a bridge to transplant may be a viable strategy to get at-risk patients home quickly. Elective LVAD implantations have been reduced and only patients classified as INTERMACS profile 1 and 2 are being considered for LVAD implantation. Delayed recognition of LVAD-related complications, misdiagnosis of COVID-19, and impaired social and psychological well-being for patients and families may ensue. Remote patient care with virtual or telephone contacts is becoming the norm. CONCLUSIONS: HF incidence, prevalence, and undertreatment will grow as a result of new COVID-19-related heart disease. ECMO should be reserved for highly selected cases of COVID-19 with a reasonable probability of recovery. Special considerations are needed for patients with advanced HF, including those supported by durable LVADs.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic that has wreaked havoc globally, which has put a heavy toll on public health, lives, and the world economy. Vaccination is considered as one of the greatest successes in medical history. Based on prior experience with the development of SARS-CoV vaccines, all COVID-19 vaccines must be subjected to the tests for protective effects and harmful risks derived from antibody-dependent enhancement that may contribute to augmented infectivity and/or eosinophilic infiltration. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is now being developed urgently in several different ways. China is regarded as one of the world's leading countries in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, up to date the last inactivated vaccine international clinical (Phase III) trial was launched in the United Arab Emirates by Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG). In this review, we outline the current status of vaccine development against clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 strains, anticipating that such attempts would help create efficacious and sage SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic apparently started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since affected many countries worldwide, turning into a major global threat. Chinese researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be classified into two major variants. They suggest that investigating the variations and characteristics of these variants might help assess risks and develop better treatment and prevention strategies. The two variants were named L-type and S-type, in which L-type was prevailed in an initial outbreak in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, and S-type was phylogenetically older than L-type and less prevalent at an early stage, but with a later increase in frequency in Wuhan. There were 149 mutations in 103 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, 83 of which were nonsynonymous, leading to alteration in the amino acid sequence of proteins. Much effort is currently being devoted to elucidate whether or not these mutations affect viral transmissibility and virulence. In this review, we summarize the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of virus evolution and discuss the significance of the gene alterations in infections.

AB  - Recently an outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, spread to the whole world in a short time and killed >1,410,000 people. It was determined that a new type of beta coronavirus called severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was causative agent of this outbreak and the disease caused by the virus was named as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID19). Despite the information obtained from the viral genome structure, many aspects of the virus-host interactions during infection is still unknown. In this study we aimed to identify SARS-CoV-2 encoded microRNAs and their cellular targets. We applied a computational method to predict miRNAs encoded by SARS-CoV-2 along with their putative targets in humans. Targets of predicted miRNAs were clustered into groups based on their biological processes, molecular function, and cellular compartments using GO and PANTHER. By using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis top pathways were identified. Finally, we have constructed an integrative pathway network analysis with target genes. We identified 40 SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs and their regulated targets. Our analysis showed that targeted genes including NFKB1, NFKBIE, JAK1-2, STAT3-4, STAT5B, STAT6, SOCS1-6, IL2, IL8, IL10, IL17, TGFBR1-2, SMAD2-4, HDAC1-6 and JARID1A-C, JARID2 play important roles in NFKB, JAK/STAT and TGFB signaling pathways as well as cells' epigenetic regulation pathways. Our results may help to understand virus-host interaction and the role of viral miRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. As there is no current drug and effective treatment available for COVID19, it may also help to develop new treatment strategies.

AB  - The recently emerged coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has become a worldwide threat affecting millions of people, causing respiratory system related problems that can end up with extremely serious consequences. As the infection rate rises significantly and this is followed by a dramatic increase in mortality, the whole world is struggling to accommodate change and is trying to adapt to new conditions. While a significant amount of effort is focused on developing a vaccine in order to make a game-changing anti-COVID-19 breakthrough, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is also developing mutations rapidly as it transmits just like any other virus and there is always a substantial chance of the invented antibodies becoming ineffective as a function of time, thus failing to inhibit virus-to-cell binding efficiency as the spiked protein keeps evolving. Hence, controlling the transmission of the virus is crucial. Therefore, this review summarizes the viability of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces under different conditions while addressing the current state of known chemical disinfectants for deactivation of the coronaviruses. The review attempts to bring together a wide spectrum of surface-virus-cleaning agent interactions to help identify material selection for inanimate surfaces that have frequent human contact and cleaning procedures for effective prevention of COVID-19 transmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. OBJECTIVES: to analyse the performance of a screening strategy proposed by the local government of Tuscany (Central Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. METHODS: a simulation study is conducted to investigate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500,000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity 0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. RESULTS: assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11,167 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1,132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Resources and false negatives increase with the prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: the analysed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low. The cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic, accounting for the fact that it may change over time.

AB  - Science is facing a turbulent backlash in which it is often viewed as "just another opinion" among many competing unscientifically backed anecdotes. In these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, when guidance from public health epidemiologists and administrators is critical, it is incumbent on all of us to consider how we can use data to tell emotionally compelling stories aimed at improving public health. When informing the public about COVID-19 and other pressing public health issues, the author argues that we must begin with emotionally captivating stories, grounded in science. Supporting this approach is the work of psychologist Paul Slovic, who has shown that human beings are not only hard-wired to be story-driven, but that we are not, in general, moved by data. The challenge, then, is to tell emotionally captivating stories supported by data, especially in these divisive times.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced public health and contributed to global economic divergences of unprecedented dimensions. Due to the high prevalence and mortality rates, it is then expected that the consequence and public health challenges will last for long periods. The rapid global spread of COVID-19 and lack of enough data regarding the virus pathogenicity multiplies the complexity and forced governments to react quickly against this pandemic. Stem cells represent a small fraction of cells located in different tissues. These cells play a critical role in the regeneration and restoration of injured sites. Because of their specific niche and a limited number of stem cells, the key question is whether there are different anti-viral mechanisms against viral infection notably COVID-19. Here, we aimed to highlight the intrinsic antiviral resistance in different stem cells against viral infection. These data could help us to understand the possible viral infections in different stem cells and the activation of specific molecular mechanisms upon viral entrance.

AB  - Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine belong to the aminoquinoline drugs. Studies revealed that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine shows antagonism activity against COVID-19 under laboratory conditions. ARDS and ALI are conditions that occur in patients with COVID-19 as the main pathological complications of cytokine storm. Inflammasomes play a key role in the pathogenesis of many diseases associated with destructive inflammation. NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. The possible role of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19 has been considered. We surveyed the potential inhibitory effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on inflammasome. Studies indicate that one of the possible anti-inflammatory mechanisms of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is inhibition of the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome.

AB  - Vaccines that generate robust and long-lived protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently required. We assessed the potential of vaccine candidates based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike in cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis) by examining their ability to generate spike binding antibodies with neutralizing activity. Antigens were derived from two distinct regions of the spike S1 subunit, either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or an extended C-terminal domain containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Three groups of 2 animals each were immunized with either each antigen, alone or in combination. The development of antibody responses was evaluated through 20 weeks post-immunization. A robust IgG response to the spike protein was detected as early as 2 weeks after immunization with either protein and was maintained for over 20 weeks. Sera from animals immunized with antigens derived from the RBD were able to prevent binding of soluble spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor, shown by in vitro binding assays, while sera from animals immunized with the NTD alone lacked this activity. Crucially, sera from animals immunized with the RBD but not the NTD had potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus, with titers in excess of 10,000, greatly exceeding that typically found in convalescent humans. Neutralizing activity persisted for more than 20 weeks. These data support the utility of spike subunit-based antigens as a vaccine for use in humans.

AB  - Modern technologies enable the exchange of information about the expansion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the continually increasing number of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases almost in real time. The gravity of a current epidemiological situation is represented by the mortality rates, which are scrupulously updated daily. Performing autopsies on patients with either suspected or confirmed COVID-19 is of high importance since these might not only improve clinical management but also reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection expansion. The following paper aimed to present the most crucial aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the point of view of forensic experts and pathologists, recommendations and safety precautions regarding autopsies, autopsy room requirements, possible techniques, examinations used for effective viral detection, recommendations regarding burials, and gross and microscopic pathological findings of the deceased who died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Autopsies remain the gold standard for determining the cause of death. Therefore, it would be beneficial to perform autopsies on patients with both suspected and confirmed COVID-19, especially those with coexisting comorbidities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection predisposes patients to arterial and venous thrombosis. This study aimed to systematically review the available evidence in the literature for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in association with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL databases to identify cases of COVID-19-associated CVT. The search period spanned January 1st to December 1st 2020 and the review protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42020214327) followed PRISMA guidelines. Identified studies were evaluated for bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Proportion meta-analysis was performed to estimate the frequency of CVT among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We identified 57 cases from 28 reports. Study quality was mostly classified as low. CVT symptoms developed after respiratory disease in 90%, the mean interval was 13 days. CVT involved multiple sites in 67% of individuals, the deep venous system was affected in 37% and parenchymal hemorrhage was found in 42%. Predisposing factors for CVT beyond SARS-CoV-2 infection were present in 31%. In-hospital mortality was 40%. Using data from 34331 patients, the estimated frequency of CVT among hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.08% (95%CI=0.01-0.5). In an in-patient setting, CVT accounted for 4.2% of cerebrovascular disorders in individuals with COVID-19 (cohort of 406 patients, 95%CI=1.47-11.39). CONCLUSION: CVT in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rare, although there seems to be an increased relative risk. High suspicion is necessary, since the diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening condition in COVID-19 patients can be challenging. Evidence is still scarce on the pathophysiology and potential prevention of COVID-19 associated CVT.

AB  - To prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to healthcare workers, we must quickly implement workflow modifications in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Our objective was to rapidly train interdisciplinary PICU teams to safely perform endotracheal intubations in children with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 using a structured simulation education program. Methods: We conducted a quality improvement study in a tertiary referral PICU. After developing stakeholder-driven guidelines for modified intubation in this population, we implemented a structured simulation program to train PICU physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. We directly observed PICU teams' adherence to the modified intubation process before and after simulation sessions and compared participants' confidence using the Simulation Effectiveness Tool-Modified (SET-M, Likert scale range 0: do not agree to 2: strongly agree regarding statements of confidence). Results: Fifty unique PICU staff members participated in 9 simulation sessions. Observed intubation performance improved, with teams executing a mean of 7.3-8.4 out of 9 recommended practices between simulation attempts (P = 0.024). Before undergoing simulation, PICU staff indicated that overall they did not feel prepared to intubate patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (mean SET-M score 0.9). After the simulation program, PICU staff confidence improved (mean SET-M score increased from 0.9 to 2, P < 0.001). Conclusion: PICU teams' performance and confidence in safely executing a modified endotracheal intubation process for children with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection improved using a rapidly deployed structured simulation education program.

AB  - Purpose: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has grown into a pandemic and without a specific cure, disease management is the need of the hour through symptomatic interventions. Studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have highlighted the role of herbal medicines either in combination with antiviral drugs or by themselves in curtailing the severity of infection and associated inflammation. Divya-Swasari-Vati is an Indian ayurvedic formulation used in the treatment of chronic cough and lung inflammation, which is one of the first symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: In this study, we used a A549 cell xenotransplant in the swim bladder of zebrafish and modeled the SARS-CoV-2 infection by injecting the fish with a recombinant spike protein. The different groups were given normal feed or feed mixed with either dexamethasone (as the control drug) or Divya-Swasari-Vati. The changes in behavioral fever, infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells in the swim bladder, degeneration or presence of necrotic cells in the kidney, and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were studied to determine the rescue of the diseased phenotype. Results: Challenge with the spike protein caused changes in the swim bladder cytology with infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells, skin hemorrhage, and increase in behavioral fever. This was also accompanied by increased mortality of the disease control fish. Treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati reversed most of the disease symptoms including damage to the kidney glomerulocytes, and complete reversal of behavioral fever. Dexamethasone, used as a comparator, was only able to partly rescue the behavioral fever phenotype. Divya-Swasari-Vati also suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, levels in a dose-dependent manner, under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Conclusion: The study showed that the A549 xenotransplanted zebrafish injected with the recombinant spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an efficient model for the disease; and treatment with Divya-Swasari-Vati medicine rescued most of the inflammatory damage caused by the viral spike protein while increasing survival of the experimental fish.

AB  - The origin and spread of current novel coronavirus had raised serious concerns among stakeholders around the globe. Different speculations that may unfold the mystery in the future are taking roots, but now there is no globally acceptable opinion about the origin and spread of this novel coronavirus. It is reported that Wuhan city of Hubei Province of central China was the epicenter of this outbreak of novel coronavirus. However, initial inadequate preventive measures allowed the infection to cross the borders of China and that pulls the world into drastic public health and economic crisis. This coronavirus disease now named as COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) and the responsible coronavirus is named as "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)." The spread of SARS-CoV-2 is alarming even after 5 months of inception and WHO further warns the world to be prepared for more intense spread of COVID-19. Different diagnostic tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 are being used around the globe, but the identification of asymptomatic carriers of the disease is a serious challenge in countering the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no specific treatment available, only preventive, symptomatic, and supportive treatments are being used for clinical management of COVID-19. The available knowledge is limited, therefore, any escalation of information on the disease will help to combat this global challenge of COVID-19. In this review, we have discussed and summarized the available multi-factorial information and recent updates on the SARS-CoV-2 which can help support future research and may help in the strategic management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The articles available online before June 30, 2020, on bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, Google Scholar, and PubMed have been assessed for the compilation of this review. Information on the official portal of WHO, CDC, ICMR, etc., were also assessed and used with due credit.

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD), an enigmatic medium vessel vasculitis, presents as an acute febrile illness predominantly affecting young children. KD appears to be a hyper-inflammatory response elicited by environmental or infectious agents (including respiratory viruses) in genetically predisposed individuals. Numerous reports from the current era of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have described the occurrence of KD/KD-like illness in close temporal proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure. Notably, KD has been reported in association with H1N1-pdm09 virus that caused the previous pandemic a decade ago. Non-H1N1 influenza infections as well as influenza vaccination have also been reported to trigger KD. Herein, we report a case of H1N1-pdm09 influenza who developed KD. We review the published literature on influenza infection or vaccination triggering KD. This may help in a better understanding of the KD/KD-like illness associated with SARS-CoV-2. Besides, we also evaluate the safety of aspirin in influenza-triggered KD as aspirin administration in children with influenza is associated with the risk of development of Reye syndrome.

AB  - Home care aides are on the frontlines providing care to vulnerable individuals in their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic yet are often excluded from policies to protect health care workers. The goal of this study was to examine experiences of agency-employed home care aides during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify ways to mitigate concerns. We used an innovative journaling approach with thirty-seven aides as well as in-depth interviews with fifteen aides and leadership representatives from nine home health agencies in New York and Michigan. Workers described a range of concerns around workplace safety including uncertainty around whether a client had COVID-19, inadequate access to personal protective equipment and safe transportation, as well as fundamental changes to interactions with clients. Agencies also faced challenges acquiring personal protective equipment for their aides. This research points to needed resources to support home care aides and home health agencies both during a public health crisis and in the future.

AB  - Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, causing coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19, led to significant morbidity and mortality. While most suffer from mild symptoms, some patients progress to a severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and an associated systemic hyper-inflammation. First to characterize key cytokines and their dynamics in this hyper-inflammatory condition, we assessed abundance and correlative expression of a panel of forty eight cytokines in patients progressing to ARDS, as compared to patients with mild disease. Then in an ongoing randomized control trial of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), we analyzed rapid effects of CPT on the systemic cytokine dynamics, as a correlate for the level of hypoxia experienced by the patients. We identified an anti-inflammatory role of CPT independent of its neutralizing antibody content. Neutralizing antibodies as well as reductions in circulating interleukin-6 and interferon gamma induced protein 10, contributed to marked rapid reductions in hypoxia in response to CPT.

AB  - The recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two highly effective COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna has brought hope to millions of American in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. The FDA Emergency Use Authorization guidance for both vaccines is to not administer the vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that all patients should be observed for 15 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination and staff must be able to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Post-FDA approval, despite very strong safety signals in both phase 3 trials, reports of possible allergic reactions have raised public concern. To provide reassurance and support during widespread vaccination across America, allergists must offer clear guidance to patients based on the best information available, but also in accordance with the broader recommendations of our US regulatory agencies. This review summarizes vaccine allergy epidemiology and proposes risk stratification schema: (1) for individuals with different allergy histories to safely receive their first COVID-19 vaccine and (2) for individuals who develop a reaction to their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global catastrophe. The elderly and people with co-morbidity are facing a serious complication of the disease. The entry and infection strategy of SARS-CoV-2 in a host cell is raised by an amazing way of ACE2 receptor recognition and imbalance of ACE/ACE2 in various organs, especially in the lungs. Here it has been discussed that during the receptor-recognition (beginning of infection), interferon, protease and followed by cytokine induction, hypoxia plays a significant role in the context of the balance of ACE/ACE2. It has also been very concisely delineated the biochemistry and mechanism of ACE/ACE2 balance in different stages of infection and its role in comorbidity.

AB  - The COVID pandemic in 2020 had unpredictable consequences on the presentation and management of patients with ischaemic heart disease. Subsequent to these initial responses the impact of the initial pandemic can be reviewed and responses can be considered. It is clear that there are new opportunities for optimising patient management pathways and in particular enhanced use of information technology. Changes in attitudes towards health and perceived risk are evident within both the catheter lab teams and our patient cohorts. Summating both the intellectual and emotional experiences of the pandemic are essential to prepare for either a second wave of COVID 19 or any new pandemic threat in the future.

AB  - Background: The literature on the impact of comorbidities on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 in kidney transplant patients is limited. We aimed to review the same. Method(s): We conducted this review as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations. PUBMED, Embase, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched for studies, available online till May 31, 2020. Studies reporting comorbidities, clinical course, and outcome of each kidney transplant patient with COVID-19 were included. Studies on any other organ transplant, recommendations, or review articles were excluded. The impact of comorbidities on severity and outcome was assessed. The study appraisal was done using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. Continuous variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test. A univariate and multivariate logistic regression for predictors of severity and outcome, was done. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020190114). Result(s): We analyzed 19 studies (56 patients) out of the 355 identified. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (83.92%). Nearly 30.35% of the patients had severe clinical course. The mortality rate was 19.64%. Advanced age was statistically significantly associated with severe course (P = 0.0173) and death (P = 0.0005). Men were more likely to have nonsevere course (P < 0.0001). No comorbidity had any impact on the severity or outcome. Patients with severe disease had higher odds of dying (P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): Comorbidities were not found to have any significant impact, hence the contribution of immunosuppression toward the severity of COVID-19 needs to be studied. Ours is the first review to assess the impact of comorbidities in kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 but limited by the number of patients.Copyright © 2020 Indian Journal of Transplantation Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important player of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in regulating the conversion of angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7). While expressed on the surface of human cells, such as lung, heart, kidney, neurons, and endothelial cells (EC), ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we would like to highlight that ACE2 is predominant on the EC membrane. Many of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms have been associated with the large recruitment of immune cells, directly affecting EC. Additionally, cytokines, hypoxia, and complement activation can trigger the activation of EC leading to the coagulation cascade. The EC dysfunction plus the inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to abnormal coagulation, actively participating in thrombo-inflammatory processes resulting in vasculopathy and indicating poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Considering the intrinsic relationship between EC and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, EC-associated therapies such as anticoagulants, fibrinolytic drugs, immunomodulators, and molecular therapies have been proposed. In this review, we will discuss the role of EC in the lung inflammation and edema, in the disseminate coagulation process, ACE2 positive cancer patients, and current and future EC-associated therapies to treat COVID-19.

AB  - Background: The global crisis caused by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, better known as COVID-19, brought the need to improve the population's immunity. The foods rich in polysaccharides with immunomodulation properties are among the most highly rated to be used as immune response modulators. Thus, the use of polysaccharides obtained from food offers an innovative strategy to prevent serious side effects of viral infections. Scope and approach: This review revisits the current studies on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, its characteristics, target cell interactions, and the possibility of using polysaccharides from functional foods as activators of the immune response. Several natural foods are explored for the possibility of being used to obtain polysaccharides with immunomodulatory potential. And finally, we address expectations for the use of polysaccharides in the development of potential therapies and vaccines. Key findings and conclusions: The negative consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic across the world are unprecedented, thousands of lives lost, increasing inequalities, and incalculable economic losses. On the other hand, great scientific advances have been made regarding the understanding of the disease and forms of treatment. Polysaccharides, due to their characteristics, have the potential to be used as potential drugs with the ability to modulate the immune response. In addition, they can be used safely, as they have no toxic effects, are biocompatible and biodegradable. Finally, these biopolymers can still be used in the development of new therapies and vaccines.

AB  - In the last year, all have suffered the devastating consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Over the course of a few months, the news media has bombarded us with messages about incidences, lethality, or even more technical measurements such as R0 or the attack rate. With this update, we hope to clarify basic concepts on the dynamic of the epidemic as well as present what is known about it as of the time of writing. To do so, the information available from international bodies such as the World Health Organization as well as the Ministry of Health has been extracted and used. In no case is it to be understood as a fixed or known situation; it is a situation that, in contrast, is invariably changeable.

AB  - Our ED-intensive care unit has instituted a new protocol meant to maximise the safety of physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists involved with endotracheal intubation of patients known or suspected of being infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2. The level of detail involved with this checklist is a deviation from standard intubation practices and is likely unfamiliar to most emergency physicians. However, the two-person system used in our department removes the cognitive burden such complexity would otherwise demand and minimises the number of participants that would typically be exposed during endotracheal intubation. We share this checklist to demonstrate to other departments how adopting international airway guidelines to a specific institution can be achieved in order to promote healthcare worker safety.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 outbreak rapidly became a public health emergency affecting particularly the frail category as cancer patients. This led oncologists to radical changes in patient management, facing the unprecedent issue whether treatments in oncology could be postponed without compromising their efficacy. Purpose: To discuss legal implications in oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perspective: Treatment delay is not always feasible in oncology where the timing often plays a key role and may impact significantly in prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the oncologists were found between the anvil and the hammer, on the one hand the need to treat cancer patients aiming to improve clinical benefits, and on the other hand the goal to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection avoiding or delaying immunosuppressive treatments and hospital exposure. Therefore, two rising scenarios with possible implications in both criminal and civil law are emerging. Firstly, oncologists may be "accused" of having delayed or omitted the diagnosis and/or treatments with consequent worsening of patients' outcome. Secondly, oncologists can be blamed for having exposed patients to hospital environment considered at risk for COVID-19 transmission. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical decision making should be well-balanced through a careful examination between clinical performance status, age, comorbidities, aim of the treatment, and the potential risk of COVID-19 infection in order to avoid the risk of suboptimal cancer care with potential legal repercussion. Moreover, all cases should be discussed in the oncology team or in the tumor board in order to share the best strategy to adopt case by case.

AB  - Despite numerous measures to contain the infection and limit its spread, cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired in hospitals have been reported consistently. In this paper, we will address issues of hospital-acquired COVID-19 in hospitalized patients as well as medico-legal implications. After having conducted a literature search, we will report on papers on hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections. Ten scientific papers were selected and considered suitable for further analysis. According to several reports, the SARS-CoV-2 hospital-acquired infection rate is 12-15%. Hospital-acquired COVID-19 represents a serious public health issue, which is a problem that could create reluctance of patients to seek hospital treatment for fear of becoming infected. Healthcare personnel should do all that is necessary to address the problem and prevent further spreading, such as rigorous compliance with all procedures for containing the spread. From a medical-legal point of view, multiple aspects must be considered in order to understand whether the infection is a result of "malpractice" or an inevitable condition.

AB  - The devastating global impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted scientists to develop novel strategies to fight Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), including the examination of pre-existing treatments for other viral infections in COVID-19 patients. This review provides a reasoned discussion of the possible use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) or their products as a treatment in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The main benefits and concerns of using this cellular therapy, guided by preclinical and clinical data obtained from similar pathologies will be reviewed. MSC represent a highly immunomodulatory cell population and their use may be safe according to clinical studies developed in other pathologies. Notably, four clinical trials and four case reports that have already been performed in COVID-19 patients obtained promising results. The clinical application of MSC in COVID-19 is very preliminary and further investigational studies are required to determine the efficacy of the MSC therapy. Nevertheless, these preliminary studies were important to understand the therapeutic potential of MSC in COVID-19. Based on these encouraging results, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the compassionate use of MSC, but only in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a poor prognosis. In fact, patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 can present infection and tissue damage in different organs, such as lung, heart, liver, kidney, gut and brain, affecting their function. MSC may have pleiotropic activities in COVID-19, with the capacity to fight inflammation and repair lesions in several organs.

AB  - Effective identification and prognostication of severe COVID-19 patients presenting to healthcare facilities are essential to reducing morbidity and mortality. Low- and middle-income country (LMIC) facilities often suffer from restrictions in availability of human resources, laboratory testing, medications, and imaging during routine functioning, and such shortages may worsen during times of surge. Low- and middle-income country healthcare providers will need contextually appropriate tools to identify and triage potential COVID-19 patients. We report on a series of LMIC-appropriate recommendations and suggestions for screening and triage of COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on a pragmatic, experience-based appraisal of existing literature. We recommend that all patients be screened upon first contact with the healthcare system using a locally approved questionnaire to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. We suggest that primary screening tools used to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 include a broad range of signs and symptoms based on standard case definitions of COVID-19 disease. We recommend that screening include endemic febrile illness per routine protocols upon presentation to a healthcare facility. We recommend that, following screening and implementation of appropriate universal source control measures, suspected COVID-19 patients be triaged with a triage tool appropriate for the setting. We recommend a standardized severity score based on the WHO COVID-19 disease definitions be assigned to all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients before their disposition from the emergency unit. We suggest against using diagnostic imaging to improve triage of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, unless a patient has worsening respiratory status. We suggest against the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound to improve triage of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients who are RT-PCR negative but have moderate to severe symptoms and are suspected of a false-negative RT-PCR with high risk of disease progression. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe clinical features who are without access to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Given that the airway epithelium is the initial site of infection, study of primary human airway epithelial cells (AEC) infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be crucial to improved understanding of viral entry factors and innate immune responses to the virus. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance recommends work with live SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture be conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. To facilitate downstream assays of materials from experiments there is a need for validated protocols for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation to facilitate safe transfer of material out of a BSL-3 laboratory. We propagated stocks of SARS-CoV-2, then evaluated the effectiveness of heat (65 °C) or ultraviolet (UV) light inactivation. We infected differentiated human primary AECs with SARS-CoV-2, then tested protocols designed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in supernatant, protein isolate, RNA, and cells fixed for immunohistochemistry by exposing Vero E6 cells to materials isolated/treated using these protocols. Heating to 65 °C for 10 min or exposing to UV light fully inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we found in SARS-CoV-2-infected primary AEC cultures that treatment of supernatant with UV light, isolation of RNA with Trizol®, isolation of protein using a protocol including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 0.1% and Triton X100 1%, and fixation of AECs using 10% formalin and Triton X100 1%, each fully inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Since its outbreak in China in December 2019 a novel Coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, has spread worldwide causing many cases of severe pneumonia, referred to as COVID-19 disease, leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic emergency in March 2020. Up to now, no specific therapy against COVID-19 disease exists. This paper aims to review COVID-19 treatment options currently under investigation. We divided the studied drugs into three categories (antiviral, immunomodulatory and other drugs). For each molecule, we discussed the putative mechanisms by which the drug may act against SARS-CoV-2 or may affect COVID-19 pathogenesis and the main clinical studies performed so far. The published clinical studies suffer from methodological limitations due to the emergency setting in which they have been conducted. Nevertheless, it seems that the timing of administration of the diverse categories of drugs is crucial in determining clinical efficacy. Antiviral drugs, in particular Remdesivir, should be administered soon after symptoms onset, in the viraemic phase of the disease; whereas, immunomodulatory agents, such as tocilizumab, anakinra and steroids, may have better results if administered in pneumonia/hyperinflammatory phases. Low-molecular-weight heparin may also have a role when facing COVID-19-related coagulopathy. Up to now, treatment choices have been inferred from the experience with other coronaviruses or viral infection outbreaks. Hopefully, in the near future, new treatment strategies will be available thanks to increased knowledge on SARS-CoV2 virus and COVID-19 pathogenesis. In the meanwhile, further well-designed clinical trials are urgently needed to establish a standard of care in COVID-19 disease.

AB  - As in previous periods of quarantine, lockdown confinement measures dictated to control SARS-CoV-2 would be expected to negatively affect mental health. We investigated the immediate effects (over a 10 day period) of a strict nationwide stay-at-home order imposed in Spain, one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing our analysis on the feelings of loneliness, we obtained our measures within a social context characterised by strong and continuous public and governmental support for increasing social bonds and cooperation in order to face the common public threat. Leveraging data from the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative, a prospective population-based study cohort, the short UCLA Loneliness Scale was administered to 1604 participants 2 years and 1 year before the stay-at-home lockdown and repeated, on average, 10 days after the official confinement order issued by the Spanish government. Ratings of loneliness remained stable during the 2 years before lockdown; however, they decreased significantly during the early stages of home confinement. This effect was particularly significant for the item 'feeling excluded from others' and was also observed among individuals who were confined alone. Overall, the results suggest that gestures and manifestations of appreciation by people for the labour and efforts of certain individuals, along with official campaigns designed to promote feelings of inclusion and belonging, may have beneficial effects on feelings of loneliness, a negative emotional state strongly regarded as a risk factor for impaired mental and general health status. Further assessments during the later stages of home confinement are now warranted.

AB  - For decades, numerous names have been given to boost an urban city: digital city, green city, smart cities and the list goes on. They are all accompanied with ideas and propositions to enrich citizens life quality, by employing latest information technology to improve environment's sustainability, through better energy usage, targeting problems affecting infrastructure costs, automation and efficient human resources distribution. Consequently, cities governors provide plans and conceive laws so society including individuals and organizations collaborate in a cycle of providers and consumers to make steps ahead toward smarti-fication of the city in which they all operate. Hence, hundreds of cities around the world are living example of what a smart cities could be resembling in terms of information technology advancement and everyday usage. Each application or to be general system serve and exist for a specific purpose, using mobile applications and small sensors together to cooperate and deliver a value imposing a huge economical and social value and significant source of data. However, most of this applications are tied to specific domains and solely designed to solve predefined problems. Thus, for a decision maker point of view, decisions' the cost becomes high to correlate multiple data flow in different shapes. As a solution, in this paper we propose a system that is based on abstracting city events of different backgrounds-social, urban and natural, we chose to call them complex space time events. Furthermore, we present its architecture and how it plays with its external actors, and finally, we explain a use case instance made specifically to counter Covid19 pandemic spread and retain public order.

AB  - Lockdown restrictions were implemented in Italy from 10 March 2020 to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to evaluate air pollution changes, with focus on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), before and during the lockdown in Rome and in the surroundings. Significant NO2 declines were observed during the COVID-19 pandemic with reductions of - 50%, - 34%, and - 20% at urban traffic, urban background, and rural background stations, respectively. Tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) was used to evaluate the spatial-temporal variations of the NO2 before and during the lockdown for the entire area where the surface stations are located. The evaluation is concerned with the pixels including one or more air quality stations to explore the capability of the unprecedented high spatial resolution to monitor urban and rural sites from space with relation to the surface measurements. Good agreement between surface concentration and TROPOMI VCD was obtained in Rome (R = 0.64 in 2019, R = 0.77 in 2020) and in rural sites (R = 0.71 in 2019). Inversely, a slight correlation (R = 0.20) was observed in rural areas during the lockdown due to very low levels of NO2. Finally, the TROPOMI VCD showed a sharp decline in NO2, larger in urban (- 43%) than in rural sites (- 17%) as retrieved with the concurrent surface measurements averaging all the traffic and urban background (- 44%) and all the rural background stations (- 20%). These results suggest air pollution improvement in Rome gained from implementing lockdown restrictions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal swabs are the primary sampling method used for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they require a trained health care professional and extensive personal protective equipment. PURPOSE: To determine the difference in sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva and estimate the incremental cost per additional SARS-CoV-2 infection detected with nasopharyngeal swabs. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched from 1 January to 1 November 2020. Cost inputs were from nationally representative sources in Canada and were converted to 2020 U.S. dollars. STUDY SELECTION: Studies including at least 5 paired nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples and reporting diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted using standardized forms, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven studies with 7332 paired samples were included. Against a reference standard of a positive result on either sample, the sensitivity of saliva was 3.4 percentage points lower (95% CI, 9.9 percentage points lower to 3.1 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, saliva's sensitivity was 1.5 percentage points higher (CI, 7.3 percentage points lower to 10.3 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, saliva was 7.9 percentage points less (CI, 14.7 percentage points less to 0.8 percentage point more) sensitive. In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem and a leading cause of hospitalization in western countries. Over the past decades, the goal has been to find the best method for monitoring congestive symptoms to prevent hospitalizations. Addressing this task through regular physician visits, blood tests, and imaging has proven insufficient for optimal control and has not decreased enough HF-related hospitalization rates. In recent years, new devices have been developed for this reason and CardioMEMS is one of the therapeutic monitoring options. CardioMEMS has shown to be effective in preventing and reducing HF hospitalizations in patients both with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. CardioMEMS' versatility has made it a great option for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, both during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and when the clinic visits have (partially) resumed. CardioMEMS is the remote haemodynamic monitoring system with the most evidence-driven efficacy, and COVID-19 has put it in the spot as a centre-stage technology for HF monitoring. In a few months of the COVID-19 epidemic, CardioMEMS has grown to maturity, making it the new normal for high-quality, high-value remote HF care.

AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, causing a severe outbreak. Because the disease is easily transmitted, face masks are a vital tool to slow the spread. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of face mask use on standard automated perimetry (SAP) results in glaucoma patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All follow-up glaucoma patients who underwent SAP between May and October 2020 were enrolled in this study. In patients with low test reliability and/or visual field changes, SAP was repeated after repositioning and taping patients' face masks. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients (59 female and 68 male) with a mean age of 59.8±10.3 years were included in the study. While 101 patients (79.5%) wore surgical face masks, 26 patients (20.5%) wore cloth face masks. Low SAP reliability appeared in 23 patients (18.1%), and inferior visual field defects were present in 3 patients (2.4%). The main effects of poorly-fitting face masks on SAP reliability were increased fixation losses and false-positive errors (for both, P=0.001). Low SAP reliability was significantly higher in patients wearing cloth face masks than in those wearing surgical face masks (47.8% vs. 9.9%; P=0.0001). The face mask-related fogging of eyeglasses before SAP is a strong predictor of fogging of the trial lenses-related low SAP reliability (odds ratio: 27, 95% confidence interval: 5.48-132.92, P=0.0001). In all repeated SAPs, the patients' reliability parameters improved, and inferior visual field artifacts disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Unsuitable face masks can cause either visual field artifacts, which may be interpreted as glaucoma progression or low test reliability. Taping the face masks' upper edges is an effective technique to prevent visual field artifacts and obtain good test reliability.

AB  - Families often face financial and geographical barriers to services for children with autism. The current study explored the effectiveness of a parent-supported adaptation of the computer game-based social skills program Secret Agent Society (SAS). Seventy child-parent dyads were randomized to SAS (n = 35) or a caregiver-supported cognitive skills training game (CIA-control comparison; n = 35), both completed over 10 weeks. Child participants were on the autism spectrum and aged seven to 12 years (60 boys, 10 girls). SAS participants improved more than CIA participants on parent-rated social skills and problem behaviors and teacher-rated social skills. Findings suggest the intervention may be a convenient, cost-effective therapeutic approach, especially during times of restricted face-to-face service access, such as COVID-19.

AB  - In this article, the spread of breathing air when playing wind instruments and singing was investigated and visualized using two methods: (1) schlieren imaging with a schlieren mirror and (2) background-oriented schlieren (BOS). These methods visualize airflow by visualizing density gradients in transparent media. The playing of professional woodwind and brass instrument players, as well as professional classical trained singers, were investigated to estimate the spread distances of the breathing air. For a better comparison and consistent measurement series, a single high and a single low note as well as an extract of a musical piece were investigated. Additionally, anemometry was used to determine the velocity of the spreading breathing air and the extent to which it was still quantifiable. The results presented in this article show there is no airflow escaping from the instruments, which is transported farther than 1.2 m into the room. However, differences in the various instruments have to be considered to assess properly the spread of the breathing air. The findings discussed below help to estimate the risk of cross-infection for wind instrument players and singers and to develop efficacious safety precautions, which is essential during critical health periods such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis article is part of a research project funded by the German Research Foundation DFG (Grant no. 444059583).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was given by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Jena, Germany.

AB  - Ifenprodil (1) is a potent GluN2B-selective N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that is used as a cerebral vasodilator and has been examined in clinical trials for the treatment of drug addiction, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19. To correlate biological data with configuration, all four ifenprodil stereoisomers were prepared by diastereoselective reduction and subsequent separation of enantiomers by chiral HPLC. The absolute configuration of ifenprodil stereoisomers was determined by X-ray crystal structure analysis of (1R,2S)-1a and (1S,2S)-1d. GluN2B affinity, ion channel inhibitory activity, and selectivity over α, σ, and 5-HT receptors were evaluated. (1R,2R)-Ifenprodil ((1R,2R)-1c) showed the highest affinity toward GluN2B-NMDA receptors (Ki = 5.8 nM) and high inhibition of ion flux in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments (IC50 = 223 nM). Whereas the configuration did not influence considerably the GluN2B-NMDA receptor binding, (1R)-configuration is crucial for elevated inhibitory activity. (1R,2R)-Configured ifenprodil (1R,2R)-1c exhibited high selectivity for GluN2B-NMDA receptors over adrenergic, serotonergic, and σ1 receptors.

AB  - The aim of the present manuscript is to discuss on potential pros and cons of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) as glucose-lowering agents during COVID-19 pandemic, and what is more to evaluate them as potential candidates for the treatment of patients, affected by COVID-19 infection, with or even without diabetes mellitus type 2. Besides being important glucose-lowering agents, GLP-1RAs pose promising anti-inflammatory and anti-obesogenic properties, pulmonary protective effects, as well as beneficial impact on gut microbiome composition. Hence, taking everything previously mentioned into consideration, GLP-1RAs seem to be potential candidates for the treatment of patients, affected by COVID-19 infection, with or even without type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as excellent antidiabetic (glucose-lowering) agents during COVID-19 pandemic times.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated catastrophic job loss, unprecedented unemployment rates, and severe economic hardship in renter households. As a result, housing precarity and the risk of eviction increased and worsened during the pandemic, especially among people of color and low-income populations. This paper considers the implications of this eviction crisis for health and health inequity, and the need for eviction prevention policies during the pandemic. Eviction and housing displacement are particularly threatening to individual and public health during a pandemic. Eviction is likely to increase COVID-19 infection rates because it results in overcrowded living environments, doubling up, transiency, limited access to healthcare, and a decreased ability to comply with pandemic mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine, and hygiene practices). Indeed, recent studies suggest that eviction may increase the spread of COVID-19 and that the absence or lifting of eviction moratoria may be associated with an increased rate of COVID-19 infection and death. Eviction is also a driver of health inequity as historic trends, and recent data demonstrate that people of color are more likely to face eviction and associated comorbidities. Black people have had less confidence in their ability to pay rent and are dying at 2.1 times the rate of non-Hispanic Whites. Indigenous Americans and Hispanic/Latinx people face an infection rate almost 3 times the rate of non-Hispanic whites. Disproportionate rates of both COVID-19 and eviction in communities of color compound negative health effects make eviction prevention a critical intervention to address racial health inequity. In light of the undisputed connection between eviction and health outcomes, eviction prevention, through moratoria and other supportive measures, is a key component of pandemic control strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread and death.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the cumulative incidences of decannulation and mechanical ventilation weaning in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who have undergone a tracheotomy. Weighted average mean times to tracheotomy, to decannulation, and to death were calculated from reported or approximated means. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were screened by 3 investigators independently. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies including patients with COVID-19 who underwent a tracheotomy were identified. Studies without reported mechanical ventilation weaning or decannulation were excluded. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: After identifying 232 unique studies, 18 articles encompassing outcomes for 3234 patients were ultimately included for meta-analysis, with a weighted mean follow-up time of 28.6 ± 6.2 days after tracheotomy. Meta-analysis revealed that 55.0% of tracheotomized patients were weaned successfully from mechanical ventilation (95% CI, 47.4%-62.2%). Approximately 34.9% of patients were decannulated successfully, with a mean decannulation time of 18.6 ± 5.7 days after tracheotomy. The pooled mortality in tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 was 13.1%, with a mean time of death of 13.0 ± 4.0 days following tracheotomy. CONCLUSION: At the current state of the coronavirus pandemic, over half of patients who have required tracheotomies are being weaned off of mechanical ventilation. While 13.1% patients have died prior to decannulation, over a third of all tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 reported in the literature have undergone successful decannulation.

AB  - Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, drugs utilized in cancer, are being repurposed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19). Recently, BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib have been found to protect against pulmonary injury in a small group of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines found in the circulation of COVID-19 patients with severe lung disease suggest the involvement of the innate immune system in this process. Understanding the potential mechanism of action of BTK inhibition in SARS-CoV-2 is clearly of importance to determine how acalabrutinib, ibrutinib and possibly other BTK inhibitors may provide protection against lung injury.

AB  - Factor V inhibitors are a rare cause of life-threatening bleeding. We present a case of an acquired factor V inhibitor likely caused by coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Bleeding was manifested by severe anemia requiring frequent red-cell transfusion, left psoas muscle hematoma, and left retroperitoneal cavity hematoma. Factor V activity was less than 1% and the factor V inhibitor titer was 31.6 Bethesda units. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA testing of the nasopharynx was positive 2 weeks before presentation and continued to be positive for 30 days. The patient failed treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone. Three cycles of plasmapheresis with fresh frozen plasma replacement resulted in correction of the bleeding and laboratory coagulopathy. This is the first reported case of a factor V inhibitor in a coronavirus disease 2019 patient and suggests that plasmapheresis may be a successful treatment strategy.

AB  - Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a key enzyme required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis and it is suggested as a target for COVID19 treatment due to high pyrimidine demand by the virus replication in the infected host cells as well as its proven effect of blocking of cytokine release by the immune cells to prevent inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress. There are a number of clinical trials underway for COVID19 treatment using DHODH inhibitors; however, there are only a small number of known DHODH antagonists available for testing. Here, we have applied a methodology to identify DHODH antagonist candidates, and compared them using in silico target prediction tools. A large set of 7900 FDA-approved and clinical stage drugs obtained from DrugBank were docked against 20 different structures DHODH available in PDB. Drugs were eliminated according to their predicted affinities by Autodock Vina. About 28 FDA-approved and 79 clinical trial ongoing drugs remained. The mode of interaction of these molecules was analyzed by repeating docking using Autodock 4 and DS Visualiser. Finally, the target region predictions of 28 FDA-approved drugs were determined through PASS and SwissTargetPrediction tools. Interestingly, the analysis of in silico target predictions revealed that serotonin-dopamine receptor antagonists could also be potential DHODH inhibitors. Our candidates shared a common attribute, a possible interaction with serotonin-dopamine receptors as well as other oxidoreductases, like DHODH. Moreover, the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase-inhibitor acalabrutunib and serotonin-dopamine receptor inhibitor drugs on our list have been found in the literature that have shown to be effective against Sars-CoV-2, while the path of activity is yet to be identified. Identifying an effective drug that can suppress both inflammation and virus proliferation will play a crucial role in the treatment of COVID. Therefore, we suggest experimental investigation of the 28 FDA-approved drugs on DHODH activity and Sars-CoV-2 virus proliferation. Those who are found experimentally effective can play an important role in COVID19 treatment. Moreover, we suggest investigating COVID19 case conditions in patients using schizophrenia and depression drugs.

AB  - There is a widely expressed concern about an unmet need for post hospitalization venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in medically ill patients, however, physicians and hospitals have been slow to implement this measure. Recommendations against extended VTE prophylaxis in medical patients from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in 2018 and the withholding of approval of betrixiban by the European Medicines Agency also in 2018 may have been influential in this regard. Furthermore, rivaroxaban the other drug approved for this indication in the U.S has not yet been approved in Europe. In addition, hospital administrators, those monitoring expenses in the U.S, have been reluctant to support a treatment which will mostly involve outpatients. Internal medicine physicians, hospitalists and nursing home physicians have not shared the fervor for post hospital VTE prophylaxis, whether with anticoagulants or aspirin, that their orthopedic surgery colleagues have, particularly in hip and knee arthroplasty. This is despite an increased risk of post hospital discharge thrombosis in both groups of patients. Enter hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a potentially severe medical illness with high hospitalization related thrombosis risk, and questions arise as to whether these medical patients, who are clearly more hypercoagulable during hospitalization than those in previous studies, should warrant post hospital discharge prophylaxis.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Burnout is a pervasive concern that negatively impacts physicians, patients, and healthcare organizations. Stress, uncertainty, clinical demands, and rapidly changing teams threaten the learning environment, where connection is key to resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic amplifies these challenges. Building an "educational peloton" to provide a safe and protective educational community may help optimize learning and team performance. Easily implementable strategies include: (1) Maximize learning opportunities, particularly small ones; (2) Ensure quality feedback; and (3) Facilitate collegiality. Intentionally nurturing an "educational peloton"-especially during times of uncertainty and change-can help drive engagement and work satisfaction, which can improve patient safety and healthcare outcomes, as well as boost human connection and promote community.

AB  - We describe the insertion of the Impella 5.0, a peripherally placed mechanical cardiovascular microaxial pump, in a patient with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The Impella is a 7 Fr device capable of achieving a flow of 4.0-5.0 L/min; its use necessitates an open arterial cut-down. A subclavicular incision is used to access the right or left axillary artery. A 10-mm tube graft is anastomosed to the artery through which the Impella 5.0 is inserted. The device traverses the tube graft and is advanced via the aorta, across the aortic valve, to its final position (inflow toward the ventricular apex and outflow above the aorta). The device may remain in situ for 10 days until recovery or until further supports are instituted. Our goal is to demonstrate the insertion of the Impella 5.0 device in a patient with cardiogenic shock whose situation was further complicated by coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is not only an enzyme but also a functional receptor on cell surfaces through which SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells and is highly expressed in the heart, kidneys, and lungs and shed into the plasma. ACE2 is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). SARS-CoV-2 causes ACE/ACE2 balance disruption and RAAS activation, which leads ultimately to COVID-19 progression, especially in patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, ACE2 expression may have paradoxical effects, aiding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, yet conversely limiting viral infection. This article reviews the existing literature and knowledge of ACE2 in COVID-19 setting and focuses on its pathophysiologic involvement in disease progression, clinical outcomes, and therapeutic potential.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a dreaded pandemic in lack of specific therapeutic agent. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, an essential factor in viral pathogenesis, is recognized as a prospective therapeutic target in drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. To tackle this pandemic, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are being screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro via in silico and in vitro methods to detect the best conceivable drug candidates. However, identification of natural compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro potential have been recommended as rapid and effective alternative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development. Thereof, a total of 653 natural compounds were identified against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro from NP-lib database at MTi-OpenScreen webserver using virtual screening approach. Subsequently, top four potential compounds, i.e. 2,3-Dihydroamentoflavone (ZINC000043552589), Podocarpusflavon-B (ZINC000003594862), Rutin (ZINC000003947429) and Quercimeritrin 6"-O-L-arabinopyranoside (ZINC000070691536), and co-crystallized N3 inhibitor as reference ligand were considered for stringent molecular docking after geometry optimization by DFT method. Each compound exhibited substantial docking energy >-12 kcal/mol and molecular contacts with essential residues, including catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and substrate binding residues, in the active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro against N3 inhibitor. The screened compounds were further scrutinized via absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion - toxicity (ADMET), quantum chemical calculations, combinatorial molecular simulations and hybrid QM/MM approaches. Convincingly, collected results support the potent compounds for druglikeness and strong binding affinity with the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Hence, selected compounds are advocated as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and can be utilized in drug development against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The Covid-19 crisis necessitated rapid adoption of remote consultations across National Health Service (NHS) child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). This study aimed to understand practitioners' experiences of rapid implementation of remote consultations across CAMHS in one NHS trust in the east of England. Data were collected through a brief questionnaire documenting clinicians' experiences following remote delivery of services. The questionnaire began before 'lockdown' and focused on assessment consultations (n = 102) as part of a planned move to virtual assessment. As the roll-out of remote consultations was extended at lockdown, we extended the questionnaire to include all remote clinical contacts (n = 202). Despite high levels of initial concern, clinicians' reports were positive overall; importantly, however, their experiences varied by team. When restrictions on face-to-face working are lifted, a blended approach of remote and face-to-face service delivery is recommended to optimise access and capacity while retaining effective and safe care.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a febrile respiratory illness that has spread rampantly across the globe and has emerged as one of the biggest pandemics of all time. Besides the direct effects of COVID-19 on mortality, collateral impacts on diagnosis and management of acute febrile illnesses (AFI) is a matter of great concern. The overlap in presentation, shunting of available resources and infection control precautions in patients with suspected COVID-19 result in a significant delay in diagnoses and management of AFI. This review highlights the challenges in the management of acute febrile illness during COVID pandemic and possible solutions for the same.

AB  - Most studies have described worse outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This has been attributed to COVID-19 associated lymphopenia (resulting in lower CD4 count), higher prevalence of comorbidities (established risk factors for severity in COVID-19) and pre-existing lung damage. The problem has been further aggravated by the lack in the access to routine care in HIV patients due to diversion of resources. In this article, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on patients with HIV infection.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Breastfeeding is beneficial to both the newborn and the mother. During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised on whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be transmitted from COVID-19 positive mother to the newborn through breastmilk. The purpose of this review is to examine the available evidence on the risks of transmission of infection from COVID-19 mothers to their newborns through breastfeeding. RECENT FINDINGS: Data is very limited in this regard, with only a few smaller case series, and case reports have been published so far. In most of the studies, breastmilk samples from COVID-19 mothers tested negative for the virus. In the case reports where the virus was detected in breastmilk and the infants were diagnosed with COVID-19, it remained unclear whether the disease was transmitted through breastmilk or direct contact or through delivery. Another hypothesis is that the viral antibodies could pass to the newborn passively through breastmilk of COVID-19 positive mothers and give immunity to the child, but data is minimal. Based on the currently available limited evidence and recognizing the benefits of breastfeeding, it may be concluded that if the health of the mother and her newborn allows, direct breastfeeding or extracted breastmilk should be encouraged by the healthcare providers after a careful discussion of the risks of vertical transmission to the mother and her family. Preventive measures should be taken by COVID-19 mothers to prevent droplet transmission of infection to the infants while breastfeeding.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vocal fold atrophy and scar can lead to loss of normal superficial lamina propria, negatively affecting the vibratory function of the vocal fold. These changes can lead to dysphonia, vocal fatigue, decreased volume, and altered pitch. Treatment options for these conditions are limited. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) consists of platelets, growth factors, and cytokines derived from the patient's own blood and is believed to activate tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to review the technical aspects of collecting PRP and injecting it into the vocal fold injection - based on our initial experience with this procedure. CASE: A patient with vocal fold scar was identified and enrolled in an ongoing prospective clinical trial study of a series of 4 monthly subepithelial vocal fold PRP injections, which was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient underwent a single injection of autologous PRP into the left vocal fold. There were no adverse events during the study period. Subjective improvement in voice was noted at 1 month after injection with subsequent return to baseline over the next 4 months. Videostroboscopy performed on postinjection day 1 and day 7 and demonstrated no concerning exam changes. Compared to the preinjection baseline, the patient-reported voice-handicap index-10 (VHI-10) and voice catastrophization index were similar at 4 months following injection (20 to 20 and 4 to 3, respectively). Independent perceptual analysis of voice showed improvement at 4 months postinjection, compared to baseline consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice 60 to 44. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report was part of a prospective trial investigating the use of PRP to treat vocal fold atrophy and scar. This work highlights the technical considerations for injecting PRP into the vocal fold. Planned prospective enrollment in this study will help to validate the safety and efficacy of PRP injections.

AB  - The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health concern globally posing a significant threat to human health and economy and creating an unprecedented crisis in all spheres of the global life. Emergence of new genotypes of SARS-CoV during the last few years has pointed out the limited efficacy of available vaccines and antivirals, constraining the global response to the COVID-19 outburst to largely monitoring/containment. There is high priority for treatment regimes and new potential therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Several candidates have shown promising outcomes in various in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, clinical trials are in progress to test conceivable therapies showing promising outcomes in various in vivo studies. Unfortunately, very little information is available in the scientific scope which offers details to the diverse strategies being targeted to fight the pandemic, particularly with respect to the molecular targets. This review article summarizes and highlights the ongoing advances and approaches that are being carried out across the globe in designing vaccines and novel therapeutics, with particular reference to the previous knowledge gained from other viral infections like with the earlier SARS and MERS-CoV. A detailed knowledge may pave the way to combat this pandemic COVID-19 as well as prevent similar deadly epidemics in future.

AB  - The pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV2 virus initiates through recognition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cells by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located at the spikes of the virus. Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have demonstrated the allosteric crosstalk within the RBD in the apo- and the ACE2 receptor-bound states, revealing the contribution of the dynamics-based correlated motions and the electrostatic energy perturbations to this crosstalk. While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in the apo-RBD, the electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable pairwise crosstalk within the RBD residues upon binding to ACE2. Interestingly, the allosteric path is composed of residues which are evolutionarily conserved within closely related corona viruses, pointing towards the biological relevance of the communication and its potential as a target for drug development.

AB  - COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coil➔helix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher ΔG values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2.

AB  - One of the best ways to contain the spread of COVID-19 is frequent testing of as many people as possible and timely isolation of uninfected personnel from infected personnel. However, the cost of massive testing is affordable in many countries. The existing technologies might not be scalable to offer affordable testing for millions of people. To address this issue, novel testing methods based on Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) were proposed that are more sensitive, require less reagents and can work with saliva samples instead of more tedious nasal swabs. As a result, LAMP based protocols can make it possible to drive the cost down to one dollar per test. These LAMP based methods require a centrifuge device, mostly for separation of viral particles from reaction inhibitors in saliva samples. However, centrifuge is neither accessible nor affordable in many resource limited settings, especially during this pandemic situation when normal supply chains are heavily disrupted. To overcome these challenges, we invented a low-cost centrifuge that can be useful for carrying out low-cost LAMP based detection of SARS-Cov2 virus in saliva. The 3D printed centrifuge (Mobilefuge) is portable, robust, stable, safe, easy to build and operate. The Mobilefuge doesn't require soldering or programming skills and can be built without any specialised equipment, yet practical enough for high throughput use. More importantly, Mobilefuge can be powered from widely available USB ports, including mobile phones and associated power supplies. This allows the Mobilefuge to be used even in off-grid and resource limited settings. We believe that our invention will aid the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 by lowering the costs of testing equipment. Apart from the COVID-19 testing, the Mobilefuge can have applications in the field of biomedical research and diagnostics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

AB  - There is no denying the fact that, for a developing country like Bangladesh, the economic consequences of lockdown for containing COVID-19 pandemic can be far reaching affecting livelihoods of millions of households. Given that the share of food consumption expenditure to total expenditure is higher in the lower income groups of Bangladesh, this shock is expected to directly affect affordability of consumption of basic food items of these households. Using nationally representative household survey data of Bangladesh, and while following the Feasible Generalized Least Square method, this paper attempts to examine food poverty, food consumption inequality along with vulnerability to food poverty of households and explores the importance of different socio-demographic and environmental factors in this connection. Our estimation reflects that, greater percentage of households with young children or with elderly people are found to suffer high food vulnerability. In addition, households in environmentally endangered regions e.g. drought prone areas or river erosion affected places are more food vulnerable than those in other parts of the country. Certain occupation groups e.g. day labourer and self-employed are found to be highly vulnerable to food poverty while according to our decomposition analysis of food consumption inequality, area of residence (urban vs. rural) is expected to cause sizable inequality in food consumption. This study can therefore, help in identifying food vulnerable households for government's social protection programs and COVID-19 incentive packages, and thereby can contribute towards designing effective poverty reduction strategies.

AB  - 2019-nCoV is the causative agent of the serious, still ongoing, worldwide coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. High quality recombinant virus proteins are required for research related to the development of vaccines and improved assays, and to the general understanding of virus action. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 2019-nCoV spike (S) protein contains disulfide bonds and N-linked glycosylations, therefore, it is typically produced by secretion. Here, we describe a construct and protocol for the expression and purification of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) labeled 2019-nCoV spike RBD. The fusion protein, in the vector pcDNA 4/TO, comprises an N-terminal interferon alpha 2 (IFNα2) signal peptide, an eYFP, a FLAG-tag, a human rhinovirus 3C protease (HRV3C) cleavage site, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV spike protein and a C-terminal 8x His-tag. We stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Following expansion of the cells, the fusion protein was secreted from adherent cells into serum-free medium. Ni-NTA immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification resulted in very high protein purity, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein was soluble and monodisperse, as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and negative staining electron microscopy. Deglycosylation experiments confirmed the presence of N-linked glycosylations in the secreted protein. Complex formation with the peptidase domain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for the 2019-nCoV spike RBD, was confirmed by SEC, both for the YFP-fused spike RBD and for spike RBD alone, after removal of YFP by proteolytic cleavage. Possible applications for the fusion protein include binding studies on cells or in vitro, fluorescent labeling of potential virus-binding sites on cells, the use as an antigen for immunization studies or as a tool for the development of novel virus- or antibody-detection assays.

AB  - BACKGROUND: since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of developing a serological test has emerged and a debate on test accuracy and reliability become an issue widely discussed in the media. The importance of communication during this pandemic has been strongly underlined by public health experts, epidemiologists, media expert, psychologists, sociologists. In the case of serological tests, there are several aspects that have to be considered: why we perform the test, what population is tested, which are the parameters conditioning the results and their interpretation. OBJECTIVES: to show how to quantify the uncertainty related to the validity of the serological test with respect to its predictive value and in particular the positive predictive value. METHODS: the evaluation of a qualitative diagnostic test includes four distinct assessments: accuracy, empirical evidence, practical importance, and prevalence of the pathology. Accuracy is measured by the sensitivity and specificity of the test; empirical evidence is quantified by the likelihood ratio, respectively for a positive and negative test result; the practical importance of the result of a diagnostic test is assessed by the positive or negative predictive value. Prevalence of COVID-19 is substantial uncertainty and it is possible to estimate the apparent prevalence starting from the results obtained with a diagnostic test. RESULTS: at the moment, the knowledge about the accuracy of serological tests is limited and little attention is paid to confidence interval on point estimates. In terms of practical importance of testing at individual level, while negative predictive values are high whatever the level of sensitivity of the test, the interpretation of a positive results is very cumbersome. Positive predictive values above 90% can be reached only by tests with specificity above 99% at the expected prevalence rate of 5%. There is a linear relationship between apparent - testing positive - prevalence and real prevalence. The apparent prevalence in the context of serological test for COVID-19 is always larger than real prevalence. The level of specificity is crucial. CONCLUSIONS: the main applications of the serological test in the epidemic contest are: to study the seroprevalence of the virus antibodies in the general population; to screen the healthcare workers for the early identification of contagious subjects' health care settings and to screen the general population in order to identify new incident cases. In the first two cases, seroprevalence study and screening of a high-risk population, the consequences of the uncertainty associated to the statistics are already accounted for in the first situation, or are overcome by repeating the screening on the healthcare workers, and using the molecular test to verify the presence of the virus in those tested positive. The case of screening of general population is more complex and of major interest for the implication it may have on individual behaviours and on the implementation of public health interventions by the political decision makers. A positive result has, per se, no practical value for individuals since the probability of being really infected by the virus is low. The uncertainty associated with the different estimates (sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) play a double role: it is a key factor in defining the informative content of the test result and it might guide the individual actions and the public policy decisions.

AB  - Introduction: In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are working with health professionals to inform governments to slow the virus's spread. The extant research contribution has been dedicated to examining the impact of climate indicators such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding their combined association between environmental quality and climate indicators to combat COVID-19 in the South American context. Methods: In this study, we collected data for environmental pollution indicators for the South America region, and correlation analysis and wavelet transform coherence were used as the analytical tools. Results: Empirical estimates conclude that PM10, NO2, CO, and O3 are significant factors in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. Implications: Our findings will serve as policy implications for the state, health officials, and regulators to combat the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in South America.

AB  - PURPOSE: CRISPR gene-editing technology has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, but most clinicians are unaware of its broad applicability. Derived from an ancient microbial defence system, these so-called "molecular scissors" enable precise gene editing with a low error rate. However, CRISPR systems can also be targeted against pathogenic DNA or RNA sequences. This potential is being combined with innovative delivery systems to develop new therapeutic approaches to infectious diseases. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for CRISPR-based strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Reference lists were reviewed and synthesized for narrative review. RESULTS: CRISPR-based strategies represent a novel approach to many challenging infectious diseases. CRISPR technologies can be harnessed to create rapid, low-cost diagnostic systems, as well as to identify drug-resistance genes. Therapeutic strategies, such as CRISPR systems that cleave integrated viral genomes or that target resistant bacteria, are in development. CRISPR-based therapies for emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have also been proposed. Finally, CRISPR systems can be used to reprogram human B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The risks of CRISPR-based therapies include off-target and on-target modifications. Strategies to control these risks are being developed and a phase 1 clinical trials of CRISPR-based therapies for cancer and monogenic diseases are already underway. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR systems have broad applicability in the field of infectious diseases and may offer solutions to many of the most challenging human infections.

AB  - The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), greatly varies from patient to patient. In the present study, we explored and compared mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from mildly affected and severely affected COVID-19 patients in order to explore any relationship between mutation profile and disease severity. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. With the help of Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool, genomic sequences were aligned with the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus reference sequence and all the mutations were identified. Distribution of mutant variants was then compared between mildly and severely affected groups. Among the numerous mutations detected, 14,408C>T and 23,403A>G mutations resulting in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P323L and spike protein D614G mutations, respectively, were found predominantly in severely affected group (>82%) compared with mildly affected group (<46%, p < 0.001). The 241C>T mutation in the non-coding region of the genome was also found predominantly in severely affected group (p < 0.001). The 3,037C>T, a silent mutation, also appeared in relatively high frequency in severely affected group compared with mildly affected group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06). We concluded that spike protein D614G and RdRp P323L mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are associated with severity of COVID-19. Further studies will be required to explore whether these mutations have any impact on the severity of disease.

AB  - The expression rate of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main viral receptor and the proteases, furin and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in cystic fibrosis (CF) individuals is poorly known. Hence, we examined their levels in upper respiratory samples of CF patients (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 45). Moreover, we sought to understand the interplay of type I interferon (IFN-I) with ACE2, furin and TMPRSS2 by evaluating their gene expression with respect to ISG15, a well-known marker of IFN activation, in upper respiratory samples and after ex vivo IFNβ exposure. Lower ACE2 levels and trends toward the reduction of furin and TMPRSS2 were found in CF patients compared with the healthy controls; decreased ACE2 amounts were also detected in CF individuals with pancreatic insufficiency and in those receiving inhaled antibiotics. Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between ISG15 and ACE2 levels. However, after ex vivo IFNβ stimulation of nasopharyngeal cells, the truncated isoform (dACE2), recently demonstrated as the IFN stimulated one with respect to the full-length isoform (flACE2), slightly augmented in cells from CF patients whereas in those from healthy donors, dACE2 levels showed variable levels of upregulation. An altered expression of SARS-COV-2 entry genes and a poor responsiveness of dACE2 to IFN-I stimulation might be crucial in the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical errors are reported as a malpractice claim, and it is of uttermost importance to learn from the errors to enhance patient safety. The Swedish national telephone helpline SHD is staffed by registered nurses; its aim is to provide qualified healthcare advice for all residents of Sweden; it handles normally about 5 million calls annually. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic have increased call volume with approximate 30%. The aim of the present study was twofold: to describe all malpractice claims and healthcare providers' reported measures regarding calls to Swedish Healthcare Direct (SHD) during the period January 2011-December 2018 and to compare these findings with results from a previous study covering the period January 2003-December 2010. METHODS: The study used a descriptive, retrospective and comparative design. A total sample of all reported malpractice claims regarding calls to SHD (n = 35) made during the period 2011-2018 was retrieved. Data were analysed and compared with all reported medical errors during the period 2003-2010 (n = 33). RESULTS: Telephone nurses' failure to follow the computerized decision support system (CDSS) (n = 18) was identified as the main reason for error during the period 2011-2018, while failure to listen to the caller (n = 12) was the main reason during the period 2003-2010. Staff education (n = 21) and listening to one's own calls (n = 16) were the most common measures taken within the organization during the period 2011-2018, compared to discussion in work groups (n = 13) during the period 2003-2010. CONCLUSION: The proportion of malpractice claims in relation to all patient contacts to SHD is still very low; it seems that only the most severe patient injuries are reported. The fact that telephone nurses' failure to follow the CDSS is the most common reason for error is notable, as SHD and healthcare organizations stress the importance of using the CDSS to enhance patient safety. The healthcare organizations seem to have adopted a more systematic approach to handling malpractice claims regarding calls, e.g., allowing telephone nurses to listen to their own calls instead of having discussions in work groups in response to events. This enables nurses to understand the latent factors contributing to error and provides a learning opportunity.

AB  - The greatest challenge the world is facing today is to win the battle against COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible. Until a vaccine is available, personal protection, social distancing, and disinfection are the main tools against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is quite infectious, the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is an enveloped virus that is relatively fragile because its protective fatty layer is sensitive to heat, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals. However, heat and liquid treatments can damage some materials, and ultraviolet light is not efficient in shaded areas, so other disinfection alternatives are required to allow safe re-utilization of materials and spaces. As of this writing, evidences are still accumulating for the use of ozone gas as a disinfectant for sanitary materials and ambient disinfection in indoor areas. This paper reviews the most relevant results of virus disinfection by the application of gaseous ozone. The review covers disinfection treatments of both air and surfaces carried out in different volumes, which varies from small boxes and controlled chambers to larger rooms, as a base to develop future ozone protocols against COVID-19. Published papers have been critically analyzed to evaluate trends in the required ozone dosages, as a function of relative humidity (RH), contact time, and viral strains. The data have been classified depending on the disinfection objective and the volume and type of the experimental set-up. Based on these data, conservative dosages and times to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 are estimated. In small chambers, 10-20 mg ozone/m3 over 10 to 50 min can be sufficient to significantly reduce the virus load of personal protection equipment. In large rooms, 30 to 50 mg ozone/m3 would be required for treatments of 20-30 min. Maximum antiviral activity of ozone is achieved at high humidity, while the same ozone concentrations under low RH could result inefficient. At these ozone levels, safety protocols must be strictly followed. These data can be used for reducing significantly the viral load although for assuring a safe disinfection, the effective dosages under different conditions need to be confirmed with experimental data.

AB  - States' decisions to expand Medicaid may have important implications for their hospitals' financial ability to weather the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study estimated the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion on hospital finances in 2017 to update earlier findings. The analysis also explored how the ACA Medicaid expansion affects different types of hospitals by size, ownership, rurality, and safety-net status. We found that the early positive financial impact of Medicaid expansion was sustained in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as hospitals in expansion states continued to experience decreased uncompensated care costs and increased Medicaid revenue and financial margins. The magnitude of these impacts varied by hospital type. As COVID-19 has brought hospitals to a time of great need, findings from this study provide important information on what hospitals in states that have yet to expand Medicaid could gain through expansion and what is at risk should any reversal of Medicaid expansions occur.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main entry point in airway epithelial cells for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 protein spike triggers viral fusion with the cell plasma membrane, resulting in viral RNA genome delivery into the host. Despite ACE2's critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, full understanding of ACE2 expression, including in response to viral infection, remains unclear. ACE2 was thought to encode five transcripts and one protein of 805 amino acids. In the present study, we identify a novel short isoform of ACE2 expressed in the airway epithelium, the main site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Short ACE2 is substantially upregulated in response to interferon stimulation and rhinovirus infection, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection. This short isoform lacks SARS-CoV-2 spike high-affinity binding sites and, altogether, our data are consistent with a model where short ACE2 is unlikely to directly contribute to host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The Betacoronaviruses comprise multiple subgenera whose members have been implicated in human disease. As with SARS, MERS and now SARS-CoV-2, the origin and emergence of new variants are often attributed to events of recombination that alter host tropism or disease severity. In most cases, recombination has been detected by searches for excessively similar genomic regions in divergent strains; however, such analyses are complicated by the high mutation rates of RNA viruses, which can produce sequence similarities in distant strains by convergent mutations. By applying a genome-wide approach that examines the source of individual polymorphisms and that can be tested against null models in which recombination is absent and homoplasies can arise only by convergent mutations, we examine the extent and limits of recombination in Betacoronaviruses. We find that recombination accounts for nearly 40% of the polymorphisms circulating in populations and that gene exchange occurs almost exclusively among strains belonging to the same subgenus. Although experimental studies have shown that recombinational exchanges occur at random along the coronaviral genome, in nature, they are vastly overrepresented in regions controlling viral interaction with host cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this viewpoint representatives of the Teaching Commission of the Anatomical Society summarize their teaching experiences gained during the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer term of 2020 and derive first recommendations concerning face-to-face and remote teaching of anatomy for the future. METHODS: Representatives of the Teaching Commission of the Anatomical Society met virtually, exchanged experiences and summarized them in writing and answered a short questionnaire. RESULTS: The required transition to remote learning during summer term of 2020 was possible, but revealed technical shortcomings and major deficits concerning practical hands-on teaching. CONCLUSION: The Teaching Commission of the Anatomical Society recommends that universities should follow the idea of as much face-to-face teaching as possible and as much online teaching as necessary for future terms.

AB  - On December 31st 2019, the World Health Organization China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City. The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works related to the new pathogen have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very early stages is challenging. In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for investigating: (1) which tools and frameworks are mostly used for early scholarly communication; (2) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify potential impactful research in tight (i.e. quasi-zero-day) time-windows. A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. Additionally, correlation coefficients are not inflated by indicators associated with zero values, which are quite common at very early stages after an article has been published. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Then, we define a method, i.e. the Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS), that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator. CIS shows promising results as a tool for selecting relevant papers even in a tight time-window. Our results foster the development of automated frameworks aimed at helping the scientific community in identifying relevant work even in case of limited literature and observation time.

AB  - The global spread of COVID-19 has created an urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine. However, in the United States, the politicization of the vaccine approval process, including which public figures are endorsing it, could undermine beliefs about its safety and efficacy and willingness to receive it. Using a pair of randomized survey experiments, we show that announcing approval of a COVID-19 vaccine one week before the presidential election compared to one week after considerably reduces both beliefs about its safety and efficacy and intended uptake. However, endorsement by Dr. Anthony Fauci increases confidence and uptake among all partisan subgroups. Further, an endorsement by Dr. Fauci increased uptake and confidence in safety even if a vaccine receives pre-election approval. The results here suggest that perceptions of political influence in COVID-19 vaccine approval could significantly undermine the viability of a vaccine as a strategy to end the pandemic.

AB  - Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are constant challenges for global public health. After the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the focus of attention for scientists, governments and populations worldwide. In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on February 26 2020, being the first country in Latin America to have affected patients. Almost four months later, more than one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the country, and the virus has spread across all 27 states and is responsible for at least 48,954 deaths until June 19, 2020. In addition, a global outbreak requires the active participation of the nursing workforce in clinical care, education, and sharing of accurate information of public health and policies. This year is particularly important for Nursing, as 2020 is the international year for Nursing and Midwifery Professionals. Nursing professionals corresponds to more than half of the health workforce in the country, being crucial in implementing public health policies and programs. Nurses and frontline health care workers have a critical role in the COVID-19 prevention and response, not only by providing direct assistance to patients and communities, but also in the implementation of health promotion and prevention strategies. Hence, we provide a reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of how the nursing profession is engaged with the COVID-19 response in Brazil.

AB  - We analyzed 21,676 residual specimens from Ontario, Canada collected between March-August, 2020 to investigate the effect of antibody decline on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimates. Testing specimens orthogonally using the Abbott (anti-nucleocapsid) and then the Ortho (anti-spike) assays, seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4%-1.4%, despite ongoing disease activity. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of antibody-positive specimens decreased over time (p=0.015), and the GMC of antibody-negative specimens increased over time (p=0.0018). The association between the two tests decreased each month (p<0.001), suggesting anti-N antibody decline. Lowering the Abbott antibody index cut-off from 1.4 to 0.7 resulted in a 16% increase in positive specimens.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) markedly affected the way healthcare professionals approach patients with cancer worldwide, not only in terms of therapeutic decision-making but also in terms of supportive care. With the rapid appearance of signs and symptoms and the need of close re-assessment, standard management of oral mucositis has been challenged by physical distancing and limited resources due to the global crisis. Building on the clinical experience developed during the acute phase by members of the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO), the implications of COVID-19 on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of mucositis are critically reported. Inspired by the restructuring of supportive care measures in response to the pandemic, suggestions for new models of approaching acute side effects are also discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COVID-19 lung injury is a common manifestation of severe illness. Lung tissue examination has been largely derived from autopsy - a combination of case reports, small and moderately sized series with international scope. Common and uncommon histopathology provides insight into the progression of severe, fatal disease. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 lung histology is most commonly diffuse alveolar damage as part of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lung injury can be temporally heterogeneous, with patterns of healing alongside new injury. Viral studies, including immunohistochemistry, RNA in-situ hybridization, and tissue-based Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assist in discerning complications of therapy (e.g. ventilator-associated pneumonia) from primary viral-induced injury. Response to viral infection produces systemic effects, and one major manifestation is thrombosis of micro-circulation and larger vessels. Less common patterns include neutrophil-rich inflammation, raising speculation that neutrophil extra-cellular traps may play a role in both viral control and exaggerated immune response. SUMMARY: The heterogeneity of fatal cases- persistence of viral infection in lung, clearance of virus but severe lung injury, thrombosis, and exaggerated immune response - suggest that antiviral, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and supportive therapy play a role in treatment, but that the patient-specific cause and timing of the lung injury is important in choosing intervention.

AB  - Since the earliest cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection were reported, our care delivery systems have been reorganized and challenged in unprecedent ways, specifically the cardiovascular community. COVID-19 poses a challenge for heart transplantation, affecting donor selection, immunosuppression, and posttransplant management. Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy is currently a viable option for patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation or destination therapy. Here, we present a therapeutic strategy for the management of acute HF with Intermacs profiles from 1 to 4, with or without Covid-19 infection, exemplified by serie of patients presenting with severe HF and successfully treated by LVAD therapy during the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and the French national lockdown. This experience has shown that we still have the capacity to provide the right therapy for the right disease to the right patient. LVAD implantation seems to be the treatment of choice for advanced HF due to the lack of healthy donor hearts for cardiac transplantation. Covid or non-Covid context, we have to take care of our patients with end-stage HF the best we can.

AB  - Membrane fusion, a key step in the early stages of virus propagation, allows the release of the viral genome in the host cell cytoplasm. The process is initiated by fusion peptides that are small, hydrophobic components of viral membrane-embedded glycoproteins and are typically conserved within virus families. Here, we attempted to identify the correct fusion peptide region in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of dual membrane systems with varied oligomeric units of putative candidate peptides. Of all of the systems tested, only a trimeric unit of a 40-amino-acid region (residues 816-855 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was effective in triggering the initial stages of membrane fusion, within 200 ns of simulation time. Association of this trimeric unit with dual membranes resulted in the migration of lipids from the upper leaflet of the lower bilayer toward the lower leaflet of the upper bilayer to create a structural unit reminiscent of a fusion bridge. We submit that residues 816-855 of Spike represent the bona fide fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 and that computational methods represent an effective way to identify fusion peptides in viral glycoproteins.

The management and communication of information on this crisis has not been properly addressed, where it is considered that its negative effects may lead not only to interfere with the communication channels with citizens but also affect the expected adherence of the population to the indications that they need to follow. This issue is especially complex when experiencing a period of information explosion, a phenomenon called 'infodemic' by the World Health Organization. This article, claiming the ethical and legal imperative to act responsibly in collecting, using, and disse minating the information that helps any authority that plays a social function, proposes a series of recommendations to achieve its effectiveness in practice.

AB  - COVID-19 is the current day pandemic that has claimed around 1,054,604 lives globally till date. Moreover, the number of deaths is going to increase over the next few months until the pandemic comes to an end, and a second wave has also been reported in few countries. Most interestingly, the death rate among certain populations from the same COVID-19 infection is highly variable. For instance, the European populations show a very high death rate, in contrast to the populations from Chinese ethnicities. Amongst all the closed cases with an outcome (total recovered + total died), the death rate in Italy is 13%, Iran is 6%, China is 5%, Brazil is 3%, The United States of America is 2%, India 2%, Israel is 1% as of October 08, 2020. However, the percentage was higher during the early phase of the pandemic. Moreover, the global death rate amongst all the patients with an outcome is 4%. Here we have reviewed virus-transmitted various respiratory tract infections and postulated a better understanding of SARS-CoV2 using lung stem cell organoids in vitro. Hence, here we propose the strategies of understanding first the infectivity/severity ratio of COVID-19 infections using various ethnicity originated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung stem cell organoids in vitro. The greater the infectivity to severity ratio, the better the disease outcome with the value of 1 being the worst disease outcome. This strategy will be useful for understanding the infectivity/severity ratio of virus induced respiratory tract infections for a possible betterment of community-based disease management. Also, such a strategy will be useful for screening the effect of various antiviral drugs/repurposed drugs for their efficacy in vitro.

AB  - The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in endoscopy is not only between patients and endoscopy staff but is also through inadequately reprocessed endoscopes. There are no studies that could confirm the efficacy of current ways of endoscope reprocessing on the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of high disinfection of endoscopes with peracetic acid on eliminating SARS-CoV-2, but surprisingly we found that the virus cannot be detected on any part of endoscopes used in critically ill patients due to SARS-CoV-2 and this was the same for all types of endoscopies and procedures. If confirmed in larger studies, these findings will probably open a new scenario in the overall understanding of the real impact of the virus.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a β-coronavirus, is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of β-coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlight that E and M induce a specific maturation of N-glycosylation of S, independently of the regulation of its localization, with a profile that is observed both in infected cells and in purified viral particles. Finally, we show that E, M and N are required for optimal production of virus- like-particles. Altogether, these results highlight how E and M proteins may influence the properties of S proteins and promote the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.

AB  - Australia's economy abruptly entered into a recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. Related labour market shocks on Australian residents have been substantial due to business closures and social distancing restrictions. Government measures are in place to reduce flow-on effects to people's financial situations, but the extent to which Australian residents suffering these shocks experience lower levels of financial wellbeing, including associated implications for inequality, is unknown. Using novel data we collected from 2078 Australian residents during April to July 2020, we show that experiencing a labour market shock during the pandemic is associated with a 29% lower level of perceived financial wellbeing, on average. Unconditional quantile regressions indicate that lower levels of financial wellbeing are present across the entire distribution, except at the very top. Distribution analyses indicate that the labour market shocks are also associated with higher levels of inequality in financial wellbeing. Financial counselling and support targeted at people who experience labour market shocks could help them to manage financial commitments and regain financial control during periods of economic uncertainty.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, for which there is no effective treatment except employing prevention strategies, has already instituted significant number of deaths. In this review, we provide a scientific view on the potential role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 virus/COVID-19 disease. Vitamin D is well-known to play a significant role in maintaining the immune health of an individual. Moreover, it induces antimicrobial peptide expression that can decrease viral replication and regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, supplementation of vitamin D has the potential to reduce the incidence, severity and the risk of death from pneumonia resulting from the cytokine storm of many viral infections including COVID-19. We suggest that supplementation of subjects at high risk of COVID-19 with vitamin D (1.000 to 3.000 IU) to maintain its optimum serum concentrations may be of significant benefit for both in the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19.

AB  - In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic in France called upon the French Army Health Services (SSA) to support the population on its national territory but also overseas, in Mayotte and French Guiana. In charge of the medical support of the forces, the SSA has evolved since the 18th century according to the format of the Armed Forces but also according to the nature of the conflicts, these changes being accompanied by ethical and moral questions. If rules of medical ethics apply to practitioners, they are also military: in this context, the notions of ethics of responsibility and ethics of conviction bring questions. Its questions are even more complex when these soldiers are projected into external operations where current conflicts, of a terrorist nature, expose the local populations, women and children specifically. Nevertheless, the SSA can also be projected to respond to exclusively health issues (excluding conflicts) as during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea in 2014, or more recently in Mulhouse with COVID-19. This last point raises fears of the development of bioterrorism where the questions of medico-military ethics would then be very complex; they must therefore be taken into account and analyzed, but also extended to raising awareness of the fighting forces.

AB  - Isoprostanes are the potential biomarkers of endogenous human metabolism and proven clinically to provide the quantitative measure of systematic oxidative injury. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analytical method capable of determining four biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-iso-PGF2α, 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III, PGE2, and 5-iPF2α-VI) in wastewater was developed and validated. Isoprostanes were quantified in the range of 31.1-1270 ng/L in raw wastewater samples in two communities in western Kentucky and Tennessee during the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent detection of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in wastewater suggested that PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI can be a reliable biomarker of community oxidative anxiety. The higher 4-month average mass load of isoprostanes [(ranged from 22.9 mg/d/1000 people to 807 mg/d/1000 people] may be attributed to the elevated community level oxidative anxiety owing COVID-19 uncertainties. The average mass loads of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in a community were significantly increased (two-tailed p < 0.001) from the first month of COVID-19 pandemic to the second month; however, significantly decreased (two-tailed p < 0.001) in the third month. Wastewater-based-epidemiological determination of isoprostanes can be a near-real-time and cost-effective approach of a trend in community depression. This is the first report of the quantification of PGE2 and 5-iPF2α-VI in wastewater and estimation of the community level oxidative anxiety.

AB  - In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies that work to understand SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. In turn, the less severe human coronaviruses such as HCoV-229E and OC43 are drawing newfound attention. These less severe coronaviruses can be used as a model to facilitate our understanding of the host immune response to coronavirus infection. SARS-CoV-2 must be handled under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions. Therefore, HCoV-229E and OC43, which can be handled at BSL-2 provide an alternative to SARS-CoV-2 for preclinical screening and designing of antivirals. However, to date, there is no published effective and efficient method to titrate HCoVs other than expensive indirect immunostaining. Here we present an improved approach using an agarose-based conventional plaque assay to titrate HCoV 229E and OC43 with mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu. Our results indicate that titration of HCoV 229E and OC43 with Mv1Lu is consistent and reproducible. The titers produced are also comparable to those produced using human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. More importantly, Mv1Lu cells display a higher tolerance for cell-cell contact stress, decreased temperature sensitivity, and a faster growth rate. We believe that our improved low-cost plaque assay can serve as an easy tool for researchers conducting HCoV research.

AB  - Contact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only "forward-trace" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that "bidirectional" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.

AB  - This commentary amplifies the insidious nature of the novel coronavirus (resulting in COVID19) and its ubiquitous spread, which disproportionately and adversely affect the health and well-being of people of color. The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus. For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization. Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply.

AB  - Monitoring compliance with, and understanding the factors affecting, COVID-19 preventive behaviors requires a robust index of the level of subjective likelihood that the individual will engage in key COVID-19 preventive behaviors. In this article, the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors Index (CPBI), including its development and validation in two samples in the United Kingdom, are described. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed on data from 470 participants in the United Kingdom who provided demographic information and completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the COVID-19 Own Risk Appraisal Scale (CORAS) and the CPBI. Results showed that a unidimensional, 10-item model fits the data well, with satisfactory fit indices, internal consistency and high item loadings onto the factor. The CPBI correlated positively with both fear and perceived risk of COVID-19, suggesting good concurrent validity. The CPBI is a measure of the likelihood of engaging in preventive activity, rather than one of intention or actual action. It is adaptable enough to be used over time as a monitoring instrument by policy makers and a modeling tool by researchers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Decisions with an ethical component have been controversial during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether leaked intensive care unit (ICU)-rationing documents, transfer of people to care-homes to 'protect the National Health Service' or the duty to treat patients despite inadequate personal protective equipment. To counter criticism of ethics per se, and to help those planning ethics support we describe the practical work of a children's hospital bioethics team in supporting children, families and clinicians during this unprecedented period. DESIGN/SETTING: Three phases of activity: (i) preparation: we composed several documents to support/guide hospital teams and, together with colleagues, provided them to regional inpatient, community and hospice settings. We adapted existing mechanisms to combat workforce moral injury; (ii) activity (March-June 2020): was highest in our rapid response service where children/families consider difficult treatment decisions with medical teams. Education provided 'pandemic webcasts' on decision-making and broader child-health concerns. Staff support was essential, especially for those deployed to overwhelmed local adult ICUs. Research ascertained young people's views on the pandemic; (iii) reflection: focussed on (a) research about future re-deployment to adult services and minimisation of moral distress/injury, (b) remote video-conferencing-parents'/participants' experience/ability to consider complex ethical issues and (c) role of faith/non-faith in society's recovery and children's views. MAIN OUTCOME/CONCLUSIONS: Our bioethics team's role during the pandemic included: case reviews via video-conferencing, many involving innovative therapy for severely unwell children with COVID-19/Paediatric-Inflammatory-Multisystem Syndrome-Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 together with their parents; processes to protect healthcare staff from moral harm and research/educational activity focused on paediatric-specific ethical arising during the pandemic.

AB  - The social distancing mandate, implemented in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, has guided many schools to deliver instruction via distance learning. Among the many challenges generated by this delivery system is the need for school mental health services, including school suicide prevention and intervention, to be conducted remotely. After briefly discussing the magnitude of the problem of youth suicide and how the COVID-19 pandemic has likely increased risk for youth suicidal ideation and behaviors, this article provides guidance on how school systems can prepare for and conduct suicide risk assessments in distance learning environments.

This article discusses recent literature documenting the impact of racism on early childhood development, disparities in access to developmental services and ways healthcare providers and health systems can promote physician well being during these difficult times. RECENT FINDINGS: Exposure to racism begins prenatally, and early childhood experiences with racism are intimately tied to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Early intervention is key to treating children with developmental delay, but disparities exist in accessing eligibility screening and in the provision of services. Paediatric providers are at risk of developing secondary traumatic stress and burnout, which may affect the care that they provide. SUMMARY: New research has led to the development of resources that help paediatric providers address racism, access developmental resources in a novel manner and protect the paediatric workforce from trauma and burnout.

AB  - COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is mild to moderate in the majority of previously healthy individuals, but can cause life-threatening disease or persistent debilitating symptoms in some cases. The most important determinant of disease severity is age, with individuals over 65 years having the greatest risk of requiring intensive care, and men are more susceptible than women. In contrast to other respiratory viral infections, young children seem to be less severely affected. It is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of COVID-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. In contrast to severe acute COVID-19, such 'long COVID' is seemingly more likely in women than in men. Also, postinfectious hyperinflammatory disease has been described as an additional outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here I discuss our current understanding of the immunological determinants of COVID-19 disease presentation and severity and relate this to known immune-system differences between young and old people and between men and women, and other factors associated with different disease presentations and severity.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 led to changes in EU financing that pose questions about the shape of the future EU "fiscal constitution". The additional Recovery Fund, with the volume of three-fourths of the new seven year budget, will be financed by the first EU borrowing ever. Is this unprecedented fiscal magnitude necessary to compete with China? Or does the EU need to downsize in two directions: (1) in the volume and differentiation of its various tasks and (2) in the equal rights among its 27 member states (01.01.2021). In any case, the COVID-19 shakeup should be incentive for a major reform of the EU finances.

AB  - The coronavirus 2019 pandemic has affected almost every aspect of health care delivery in the United States, and the emergency medicine system has been hit particularly hard while dealing with this public health crisis. In an unprecedented time in our history, medical systems and clinicians have been asked to be creative, flexible, and innovative, all while continuing to uphold the important standards in the US health care system. To continue providing quality services to patients during this extraordinary time, care providers, organizations, administrators, and insurers have needed to alter longstanding models and procedures to respond to the dynamics of a pandemic. The Emergency Medicine Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986, or EMTALA, is 1 example of where these alterations have allowed health care facilities and clinicians to continue their work of caring for patients while protecting both the patients and the clinicians themselves from infectious exposures at the same time.

AB  - The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on health, healthcare infrastructure, social structure, and economics. One of the limiting factors in containing the spread of this virus has been the lack of widespread availability of fast, inexpensive, and reliable methods for testing of individuals. Frequent screening for infected and often asymptomatic people is a cornerstone of pandemic management plans. Here, we introduce two pH sensitive ″LAMPshade″ dyes as novel readouts in an isothermal RT-LAMP amplification assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The resulting JaneliaLAMP (jLAMP) assay is robust, simple, inexpensive, has low technical requirements and we describe its use and performance in direct testing of contrived and clinical samples without RNA extraction.Competing Interest StatementH.M acknowledges research collaboration and contribution with equipment and reagents from Bio-Rad Laboratories and DiaSorin Molecular.

AB  - WHO/UNICEF estimates for HPV vaccination coverage from 2010 to 2019 are analyzed against the backdrop of the 90% coverage target for HPV vaccination by 2030 set in the recently approved global strategy for cervical cancer elimination as a public health problem. As of June 2020, 107 (55%) of the 194 WHO Member States have introduced HPV vaccination. The Americas and Europe are by far the WHO regions with the most introductions, 85% and 77% of their countries having already introduced respectively. A record number of introductions was observed in 2019, most of which in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) where access has been limited. Programs had an average performance coverage of around 67% for the first dose and 53% for the final dose of HPV. LMICs performed on average better than high- income countries for the first dose, but worse for the last dose due to higher dropout. Only 5 (6%) countries achieved coverages with the final dose of more than 90%, 22 countries (21%) achieved coverages of 75% or higher while 35 (40%) had a final dose coverage of 50% or less. When expressed as world population coverage (i.e., weighted by population size), global coverage of the final HPV dose for 2019 is estimated at 15%. There is a long way to go to meet the 2030 elimination target of 90%. In the post-COVID era attention should be paid to maintain the pace of introductions, specially ensuring the most populous countries introduce, and further improving program performance globally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are widely used as excipients in drugs, cosmetics and household products. Immediate-type allergy to PEGs including anaphylaxis are rare. The recent introduction of the mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines has led to an increased focus on PEG as a possible culprit of allergic reactions to the vaccine. A low awareness of the allergenic potential of PEG among consumers, manufacturers and doctors leads to under-diagnosis and under-reporting of allergy to PEGs, putting patients at risk of repeated severe reactions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical manifestations, time to diagnosis and impact of a PEG allergy diagnosis on the daily life of patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG from 2010 to 2019. METHOD: Ten patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG were included. Detailed clinical history was obtained, and allergy investigations had been performed at the time of diagnosis. All patients were contacted and asked to retrospectively complete a questionnaire about causes and impact on daily life of an allergy to PEG, scored on a likert scale (0-10) before and after diagnosis. RESULTS: Eight patients had experienced at least one anaphylactic reaction requiring adrenaline treatment. Anaphylaxis was primarily caused by antibiotic/analgesic tablets, depot-steroids, antacids and laxatives. Seven patients reported repeated reactions before diagnosis (median 3, range 2-6). Median time from first reaction to diagnosis was 20 months (range 2-120). None of the patients experienced severe allergic reactions after the diagnosis. Median likert score of the impact on daily life before diagnosis was 7 compared to 4 after diagnosis. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The clinical manifestations of PEG allergy are often dramatic. Improved awareness about the clinical presentation and common culprits, clear product labelling and a standardized nomenclature is needed to ensure timely diagnosis of PEG allergy to prevent repeated anaphylactic reactions with severe impact on patient's lives.

AB  - This study uses trade data from Switzerland's Federal Customs Administration to examine the impact of Covid-19 on international goods trade between January and July 2020. We show that Swiss trade during that period fell by 11% compared to 2019 and that the contraction following the "Federal Lockdown" in mid-March was considerably steeper than the Swiss trade collapse in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008. Examining cross-country variation in Covid-19 cases, the stringency of containment measures, and Swiss trade flows, we document that the pandemic adversely affected both the demand and supply side of foreign trade, while trade restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations played no major role behind the rapid decline of Swiss trade in the first half of 2020.

AB  - The Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein Nsp9 is a 113-residue protein that is essential for viral replication, and consequently, a potential target for the development of therapeutics against COVID19 infections. To capture insights into the dynamics of the protein's backbone in solution and accelerate the identification and mapping of ligand-binding surfaces through chemical shift perturbation studies, the backbone 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR chemical shifts for Nsp9 have been extensively assigned. These assignments were assisted by the preparation of an ~ 70% deuterated sample and residue-specific, 15N-labelled samples (V, L, M, F, and K). A major feature of the assignments was the "missing" amide resonances for N96-L106 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, a region that comprises almost the complete C-terminal α-helix that forms a major part of the homodimer interface in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, suggesting this region either undergoes intermediate motion in the ms to μs timescale and/or is heterogenous. These "missing" amide resonances do not unambiguously appear in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 collected at a concentration of 0.0007 mM. At this concentration, at the detection limit, native mass spectrometry indicates the protein is exclusively in the monomeric state, suggesting the intermediate motion in the C-terminal of Nsp9 may be due to intramolecular dynamics. Perhaps this intermediate ms to μs timescale dynamics is the physical basis for a previously suggested "fluidity" of the C-terminal helix that may be responsible for homophilic (Nsp9-Nsp9) and postulated heterophilic (Nsp9-Unknown) protein-protein interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human spillovers of SARS-CoV-2 to dogs and the emergence of a highly contagious avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus have raised concerns towards the role of dogs in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and their susceptibility to existing human and avian influenza viruses which might result in further reassortment. METHODS: We systematically studied the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, influenza A viruses of H1, H3, H5, H7 and H9 subtypes and influenza B viruses of Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages in ex-vivo canine nasal cavity (NC), soft palate (SP), trachea (T) and lung (L) tissue explant cultures and examined ACE2 and sialic acid (SA) receptor distribution in these tissues. RESULTS: There was limited productive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in canine NC and SARS-CoV in canine NC, SP and L with unexpectedly high ACE2 levels in canine NC and SP. Meanwhile, the canine tissues were susceptible to a wide range of human and avian influenza viruses, which matched with the abundance of both human and avian SA receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Existence of suitable receptors and tropism for the same tissue foster virus adaptation and reassortment. Continuous surveillance in dog populations should be conducted given the plenty of chances for spillover during outbreaks.

AB  - The preoperative evaluation and risk assessment has always been a critical aspect of safe surgical practice, and in the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it has become even more crucial to patient safety. Emerging data show that surgical procedures in patients who test positive for coronavirus disease (COVID) are associated with worse clinical outcomes and increased postoperative complications and mortality. In addition to personal protective equipment (PPE) management, isolation protocols, preoperative SARS-CoV-2 screening, and steps to ensure clinician safety, determining how to deem patients who have recovered from COVID-19 safe to proceed is an added challenge. We present a preoperative protocol for evaluation of previously COVID-positive patients for elective surgery.

AB  - The pandemic of the disease known as COVID-19 (acronym for coronavirus disease-2019), which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, has led to an international public health emergency. This due to several reasons (threat to the lives of many people, unprecedented health and socioeconomic crisis, cessation of school and work activities, or the need to adopt extraordinary measures, including quarantining entire cities or countries). The PAPPS Mental Health Group has considered it important to observe, reflect and investigate the phenomena that are occurring, and will occur, in what has possibly been one of the most extensive and radical public health interventions in recent history. This work makes an approach to the psychological and psychosocial characteristics that the COVID-19 pandemic is acquiring in the countries of our socio-cultural environment, and proposes a series of reflections and recommendations for the psychological care of the population, health workers, and social organisation.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the name for the new illness caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. By March 11, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO. This virus has extensively altered daily life for many across the globe, while claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. While fundamentally a respiratory illness, many infected individuals experience symptoms that involve the central nervous system (CNS). It is likely that many of these symptoms are the result of the virus residing outside of the CNS. However, the current evidence does indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can use olfactory neurons to travel from the periphery into the CNS, and that the virus may also enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We discuss how the virus may use established infection mechanisms (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Cathepsin L), as well mechanisms still under consideration (NRP1 and BASIGIN) to infect and spread throughout the CNS. Confirming the impact of the virus on the CNS will be crucial in dealing with the long-term consequences of the epidemic.

AB  - The issue of the COVID-19 pandemic occupies the agenda of the whole world. The pivot of this pandemic is a crucial element that has become almost as important as the virus itself, namely the lockdown. Although, the rationale for lockdown is well-sustained by strong epidemiological arguments, exploring the 'other' unwanted consequences of the contemporary COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory for coagulating a robust agreed position against the numerous problems generated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Starting from the rationale of the lockdown, in this paper we explored and exposed the other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic measures such as the use or abuse of human rights and freedom restrictions, economic issues, marginalized groups and eclipse of all other diseases. Our scientific attempt is to coagulate a stable position and integrate current opposing views by advancing the idea that rather than applying the uniform lockdown policy, one could recommend instead an improved model targeting more strict and more prolonged lockdowns to vulnerable risk/age groups while enabling less stringent measures for the lower-risk groups, minimizing both economic losses and deaths. Rigorous (and also governed by freedom) debating may be able to synchronize the opposed perspectives between those advocating an extreme lockdown (e.g., most of the epidemiologists and health experts), and those criticizing all restrictive measures (e.g., economists and human rights experts). Confronting the multiple facets of the public health mitigation measures is the only way to avoid contributing to history with yet another failure, as seen in other past epidemics.

AB  - Pandemics pose unique risks to people in correctional facilities. Among other vulnerabilities, incarcerated populations often have high rates of mental disorders and substance use disorders, which may increase risks for morbidity and mortality during a pandemic. California's San Quentin State Prison (SQSP) experienced multiple outbreaks during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and, a century later, the prison faces a new pandemic. This Open Forum describes the modification of mental health services in SQSP during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors explore the challenges of reducing risks of viral contagion while maintaining high-quality mental health care in a correctional setting.

AB  - COVID-19 infection may lead to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome where severe gas exchange derangements may be associated, at least in the early stages, only with minor pulmonary infiltrates. This suggests that the shunt associated to the gasless lung parenchyma is not sufficient to explain CARDS hypoxemia. We designed an algorithm (VentriQlar), based on the same conceptual grounds described by J.B West in 1969. We set 499 ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) compartments and, after calculating their blood composition (PO2, PCO2 and pH), we randomly chose 106 combinations of five parameters controlling a bimodal distribution of blood flow. The solutions were accepted if the predicted PaO2 and PaCO2 were within 10% of the patient's values. We assumed that shunt fraction equaled the fraction of non-aerated lung tissue at the CT quantitative analysis. Five critically-ill patients later deceased were studied. The PaO2/FiO2 was 91.1±18.6 mmHg and PaCO2 69.0±16.1 mmHg. Cardiac output was 9.58±0.99 l/min. The fraction of non-aerated tissue was 0.33±0.06. The model showed that a large fraction of the blood flow was likely distributed in regions with very low VA/Q (Qmean=0.06±0.02) and a smaller fraction in regions with moderately high VA/Q. Overall LogSD, Q was 1.66 ± 0.14, suggestive of high VA/Q inequality. Data suggest that shunt alone cannot completely account for the observed hypoxemia and a significant VA/Q inequality must be present in COVID-19. The high cardiac output and the extensive microthrombosis later found in the autopsy further support the hypothesis of a pathological perfusion of non/poorly ventilated lung tissue.

AB  - Importance: Nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the noninvasive criterion standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it requires trained personnel, limiting its availability. Saliva NAAT represents an attractive alternative, but its diagnostic performance is unclear. Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of saliva NAAT for COVID-19. Data Sources: In this systematic review, a search of the MEDLINE and medRxiv databases was conducted on August 29, 2020, to find studies of diagnostic test accuracy. The final meta-analysis was performed on November 17, 2020. Study Selection: Studies needed to provide enough data to measure salivary NAAT sensitivity and specificity compared with imperfect nasopharyngeal swab NAAT as a reference test. An imperfect reference test does not perfectly reflect the truth (ie, it can give false results). Studies were excluded if the sample contained fewer than 20 participants or was neither random nor consecutive. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline was followed for the systematic review, with multiple authors involved at each stage of the review. To account for the imperfect reference test sensitivity, we used a bayesian latent class bivariate model for the meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pooled sensitivity and specificity. Two secondary analyses were performed: one restricted to peer-reviewed studies, and a post hoc analysis limited to ambulatory settings. Results: The search strategy yielded 385 references, and 16 unique studies were identified for quantitative synthesis. Eight peer-reviewed studies and 8 preprints were included in the meta-analyses (5922 unique patients). There was significant variability in patient selection, study design, and stage of illness at which patients were enrolled. Fifteen studies included ambulatory patients, and 9 exclusively enrolled from an outpatient population with mild or no symptoms. In the primary analysis, the saliva NAAT pooled sensitivity was 83.2% (95% credible interval [CrI], 74.7%-91.4%) and the pooled specificity was 99.2% (95% CrI, 98.2%-99.8%). The nasopharyngeal swab NAAT had a sensitivity of 84.8% (95% CrI, 76.8%-92.4%) and a specificity of 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.4%-99.8%). Results were similar in secondary analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that saliva NAAT diagnostic accuracy is similar to that of nasopharyngeal swab NAAT, especially in the ambulatory setting. These findings support larger-scale research on the use of saliva NAAT as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs.

AB  - Since SARS-Cov-2 started spreading in China and turned into a pandemic disease called Covid-19, many articles about prediction with mathematical model have appeared in the literature. In addition to models in specialized journals, a significant amount of software was made available, presenting with dashboards spreading of the pandemic for each new. These models are solved by computer simulation of traditional exponential models as a representation of the growth of cases and deaths. Some more accurate models are based on existing variations of SIR model (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered). A third class of study is developed in spatial or probabilistic models as a way of forecasting the effect of Covid-19 around the world. Data on the number of positive cases in all countries, show that SARS-Cov-2 shows great resistance even after strategies of lockdown or social distancing. The purpose of this article is to show how the bifurcation theory, known as Catastrophe Theory, can help to understand why Covid-19 expansion rates change so much and even with low values for a longtime trigger contagion quickly and abruptly. The Catastrophe Theory was conceived by the mathematician Rene Thom in the 60s with wide applications in works in the 70s. The outbreak of spruce budworm in Canada revealed a very interesting opportunity to test Catastrophe Theory whose explanation for the phenomenon was widely debated in the academic world. Inspired by the same mathematical approach to this phenomenon in Canada in the 1970s, we applied the Catastrophe Theory in the current Covid-19 pandemic. We observed that sudden outbreaks occur when the carrying capacity and the rate of expansion of the virus reach a region of bifurcation on the cusp surface. With actual Covid-19 data obtained from WHO, we fitted the dynamic model using the particle swarm technique and compared the results in the bifurcation plan with the Covid-19 outbreaks in different regions of the world. It is possible in many cases to observe the trajectory of the parameters between limit points in the bistable region and the consequent explosion of cases observed for each country assessed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFor this work no external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - At the beginning of 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to a worldwide pandemic and mass panic. The number of infected people has been increasing exponentially since, and the mortality rate has also been concomitantly increasing. At present, no study has summarized the mortality risk of COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to conduct a literature review and meta-analysis to understand the frequency of mortality among CKD patients infected with COVID-19. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted on the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to find articles published until May 15, 2020. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. After careful screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3,867,367 patients from 12 studies were included. The mortality rate was significantly higher among CKD patients with COVID-19 infection than among CKD patients without COVID-19 infection, as indicated by a pooled OR of 5.81 (95% CI 3.78-8.94, P < 0.00001, I2 = 30%). The patients were then stratified into ≥ 70 and < 70 years, and subgroup analysis revealed that among CKD patients with COVID-19 infection, the mortality rate was higher in the < 70 years group (OR 8.69, 95% CI 7.56-9.97, P < 0.0001) than in the ≥ 70 years group (OR 2.44, 95% CI 0.75-6.63, P = 0.15). Thus, COVID-19 patients with CKD have a high mortality risk and require a comprehensive multidisciplinary management strategy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an international consensus on managing penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 acute waves. A major concern for patients with penile cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is how the enforced safety measures will affect their disease management. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation may have an impact on the extent of the primary lesion as well as the cancer-specific survival because of the development and progression of inguinal lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the COVID-19 literature was conducted in conjunction with analysis of current international guidelines on the management of penile cancer. Results were presented to an international panel of experts on penile cancer and infection control by a virtual accelerated Delphi process using 4 survey rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as an agreement of ≥80%, which was used to reconfigure management pathways for penile cancer. RESULTS: Limited evidence is available for delaying penile cancer management. The consensus rate of agreement was 100% that penile cancer pathways should be reconfigured, and measures should be developed to prevent perioperative nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. The panel also reached a consensus on several statements aimed at reconfiguring the management of penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The international consensus panel proposed a framework for the diagnostic and invasive therapeutic procedures for penile cancer within a low-risk environment for COVID-19.

AB  - The determinants of the risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2, contracting COVID-19, and being affected by the more serious forms of the disease have been generally explored in merely qualitative terms. It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.

COVID-19 has accelerated adoption of digital health. During this time, the distance is itself a prevention tool and the use of technology to deliver healthcare services and information has driven the discovery of mobile and connected health services. Health services should to be prepared to integrate the old model of remote monitoring of CIEDs and adopt new digital tools such as mobile Apps and connected sensors.

AB  - During a pandemic, pregnancy and the postnatal period are complicated by multiple factors. On the one hand, worries about one's own health and the health of loved ones, in particular of the newborn child, can increase the risk of some mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety in the pregnant woman. On the other hand, as happened for the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, given the need for physical distancing, the maintenance of the social and family network, so important for new parents in the perinatal period, is lacking. In addition, health services are forced to reorganize their offerings to ensure maximum safety for their operators and patients. This work proposes a model of screening and treatment aimed at identifying women at risk and providing them with effective and safe treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The OM-85 (Broncho-Vaxom) consumption has drawn considerable attention in the prevention of recurrent respiratory tract infections. However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search up-to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 pediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM-85. They were reporting relationships between OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or Mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM-85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: OM-85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.66- -0.65, p<0.001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, -19.51; 95% CI, -23.00- -16.01, p<0.001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.77, p=0.006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, -1.40; 95% CI, -2.63-0.17, p=0.03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29-0.52, p<0.001). However, OM-85 consumption was not significantly related to adverse event rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.52-2.03, p=0.94); or to wheezing attacks frequency (MD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.59-0.08, p=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of OM-85 consumption on recurrent respiratory tract infections may have a great effect as a tool to improve subjects' immunity against recurrent respiratory tract infections, which could be helpful in crucial situations e.g. COVID-19 pandemic. OM-85 non-consumers had an independent risk relationship with recurrent respiratory tract infections. This relationship forces us to recommend OM-85 consumption with those with a high risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections to avoid any possible complications.

AB  - The discovery of T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in non-infected individuals indicates cross-reactive immune memory from prior exposure to human coronaviruses (HCoV) that cause the common cold. This raises the possibility that "immunity" could exist within populations at rates that may be higher than serology studies estimate. Besides specialized research labs, however, there is limited ability to measure HCoV CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which currently impedes interpretation of any potential correlation between COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and the calibration of pandemic control measures. Given this limited testing ability, an alternative approach would be to exploit the large cohort of currently available data from which statistically significant associations may be generated. This would necessitate the merging of several public databases including patient and contact tracing, which could be created by relevant public health organizations. Including data from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in SARS-CoV-2 databases and surveillance systems could provide the necessary information to allow for more informed decisions.

Using the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model of work system and patient safety, we describe various work system barriers and facilitators experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 crisis. We propose a set of five principles based on this HFE systems approach related to novel pandemic: (i) deferring to local expertise, (ii) facilitating adaptive behaviors, (iii) enhancing interactions between system elements and levels along the patient journey, (iv) re-purposing existing processes and (v) encouraging dynamic continuous learning.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads mainly via aerosol (microdroplets) in enclosed environments where temperature and humidity are regulated via air-conditioning (A/C). About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop COVID-19 disease. Among them, ∼25% require hospitalization. In medicine "cases" identify those who become ill. During this pandemic "cases" has been used to identify those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, including ∼70% asymptomatic; this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals >65 and those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, immune-depressed cancer patients, etc., are at higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality-rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death-rate 154.9/100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The US includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a co-factor, have lower death-rates. Numerous therapies are being developed and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only ∼50% of the US population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. By sharing accurate information, physicians, health professionals and scientists play a key role addressing myths and anxiety, help public health officials enact measures to decrease infections, and provide the best care for those who become sick. We discuss these issues.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Virtually all viruses have evolved molecular instruments to circumvent cell mechanisms that may hamper their replication, dissemination, or persistence. Among these is p53, a key gatekeeper for cell division and survival that also regulates innate immune responses. This review summarizes the strategies used by different viruses and discusses the mechanisms deployed by SARS-CoV to target p53 activities. RECENT FINDINGS: We propose a typology for the strategies used by different viruses to address p53 functions: hit and run (e.g. IAV, ZIKV), hide and seek (e.g. HIV1), kidnap and exploit (e.g. EBV, HSV1), dominate and suppress (e.g. HR HPV). We discuss the mechanisms by which SARS nsp3 protein targets p53 for degradation and we speculate on the significance for Covid-19 pathogenesis and risk of cancer. SUMMARY: p53 may operate as an intracellular antiviral defense mechanism. To circumvent it, SARS viruses adopt a kidnap and exploit strategy also shared by several viruses with transforming potential. This raises the question of whether SARS infections may make cells permissive to oncogenic DNA damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to describe and compare the effectiveness of national and local lockdowns in controlling the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: a rapid review of published and grey literature on COVID-19 pandemic was conducted following predefined eligibility criteria by searching electronic databases, repositories of pre-print articles, websites and databases of international health, and research related institutions and organisations. RESULTS: of 584 initially identified records up to 5 July 2020, 19 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Most of the studies (No. 11) used the reproduction number (Rt) as a measure of effect and in all of them areduction of the estimated value at post-intervention period was found. The implementation of lockdown in 11 European countries was associated with an average 82% reduction of Rt, ranging from a posterior Rt of 0.44 (95%CI 0.26-0.61) for Norway to a posterior Rt of 0.82 (95%CI 0.73- 0.93) for Belgium. Changes in infection rates and transmission rates were estimated in 8 studies. Daily changes in infection rates ranged from -0.6% (Sweden) to -11.3% (Hubei and Guangdong provinces). Additionally, other studies reported a change in the trend of hospitalizations (Italy, Spain) and positive effects on the doubling time of cases (Hubei, China) after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: results of this rapid review suggest a positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, with a major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive. Rigorous research is warranted to evaluate which approach is the most effective in each stage of the epidemic and in specific social contexts, in particular addressing if these approaches should be implemented on the whole population or target specific risk groups.

AB  - Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has inspired new innovations in diagnosing, treating, and dispositioning patients during high census conditions with constrained resources. Our objective is to describe first experiences of physician interaction with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm designed to enhance physician abilities to identify ground-glass opacities and consolidation on chest radiographs. Methods: During the first wave of the pandemic, we deployed a previously developed and validated deep-learning AI algorithm for assisted interpretation of chest radiographs for use by physicians at an academic health system in Southern California. The algorithm overlays radiographs with "heat" maps that indicate pneumonia probability alongside standard chest radiographs at the point of care. Physicians were surveyed in real time regarding ease of use and impact on clinical decisionmaking. Results: Of the 5125 total visits and 1960 chest radiographs obtained in the emergency department (ED) during the study period, 1855 were analyzed by the algorithm. Among these, emergency physicians were surveyed for their experiences on 202 radiographs. Overall, 86% either strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the intervention was easy to use in their workflow. Of the respondents, 20% reported that the algorithm impacted clinical decisionmaking. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first published literature evaluating the impact of medical imaging AI on clinical decisionmaking in the emergency department setting. Urgent deployment of a previously validated AI algorithm clinically was easy to use and was found to have an impact on clinical decision making during the predicted surge period of a global pandemic.

AB  - We present a case of haemorrhagic enterocolitis in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 who recovered from respiratory failure after support with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We describe clinicopathological features consistent with the systemic coinfection/reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) concurrent with COVID-19 infection and the protracted clinical course of resolution of gastrointestinal inflammation after the treatment of CMV infection. Stool PCR, abdominal CT perfusion scan and histological examination of ileal and colonic tissues excluded enterocolitis secondary to other causes of infection (common viral, bacterial and protozoal gastrointestinal pathogens), macrovascularand microvascular ischaemia and classic inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. We propose possible synergistic pathophysiologic mechanisms for enterocolitis complicating severe COVID-19 infection: (1) T lymphocyte depletion and immune response dysregulation, (2) use of immunomodulators in the management of severe COVID-19 infection and (3) high concentration of ACE-2 receptors for COVID-19 virus in the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - A considerable number of clinical trials is being conducted globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including in low- and middle-income countries such as those in the Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC). Yet, an abundance of studies does not necessarily shorten the path to find safe and efficacious interventions for COVID-19. We analyze the trials for COVID-19 treatment and prevention that are registered from LAC countries in the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and identify a trend towards small repetitive non-rigorous studies that duplicate efforts and drain limited resources without producing meaningful conclusions on the safety and efficacy of the interventions being tested. We further assess the challenges to conducting scientifically sound and socially valuable research in the LAC region in order to inform recommendations to encourage clinical trials that are most likely to produce robust evidence during the pandemic.

AB  - Background: People with active cancer are recognised as at risk of COVID-19 complications, but it is unclear whether the much larger population of cancer survivors is at elevated risk. We aimed to address this by comparing cancer survivors and cancer-free controls for (i) prevalence of comorbidities considered risk factors for COVID-19; and (ii) risk of severe influenza, as a marker of susceptibility to severe outcomes from epidemic respiratory viruses. Methods: We included survivors (≥1 year) of the 20 most common cancers, and age, sex and general practice-matched cancer-free controls, derived from English primary care data linked to cancer registrations, hospital admissions and death registrations. Comorbidity prevalences were calculated 1 and 5 years from cancer diagnosis. Risk of hospitalisation or death due to influenza was compared using Cox models adjusted for baseline demographics and comorbidities. Findings: 108,215 cancer survivors and 523,541 cancer-free controls were included. Cancer survivors had more diabetes, asthma, other respiratory, cardiac, neurological, renal, and liver diseases, and less obesity, compared with controls, but there was variation by cancer site. There were 205 influenza hospitalisations/deaths, with cancer survivors at higher risk than controls (adjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 2.04-3.80). Haematological cancer survivors had large elevated risks persisting for >10 years (HR overall 15.17, 7.84-29.35; HR >10 years from cancer diagnosis 10.06, 2.47-40.93). Survivors of other cancers had evidence of raised risk up to 5 years from cancer diagnosis only (HR >5 years 2.22, 1.31-3.74). Interpretation: Risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes are likely to be elevated in cancer survivors. This should be taken into account in policies targeted at clinical risk groups, and vaccination for both influenza, and, when available, COVID-19, should be encouraged in cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid expansion of dengue, Zika and chikungunya with large scale outbreaks are an increasing public health concern in many countries. Additionally, the recent coronavirus pandemic urged the need to get connected for fast information transfer and exchange. As response, health programmes have -among other interventions- incorporated digital tools such as mobile phones for supporting the control and prevention of infectious diseases. However, little is known about the benefits of mobile phone technology in terms of input, process and outcome dimensions. The purpose of this scoping review is to analyse the evidence of the use of mobile phones as an intervention tool regarding the performance, acceptance, usability, feasibility, cost and effectiveness in dengue, Zika and chikungunya control programmes. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies and reports by systematically searching: i) electronic databases (PubMed, PLOS ONE, PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease, LILACS, WHOLIS, ScienceDirect and Google scholar), ii) grey literature, using Google web and iii) documents in the list of references of the selected papers. Selected studies were categorized using a pre-determined data extraction form. Finally, a narrative summary of the evidence related to general characteristics of available mobile health tools and outcomes was produced. RESULTS: The systematic literature search identified 1289 records, 32 of which met the inclusion criteria and 4 records from the reference lists. A total of 36 studies were included coming from twenty different countries. Five mobile phone services were identified in this review: mobile applications (n = 18), short message services (n=7), camera phone (n = 6), mobile phone tracking data (n = 4), and simple mobile communication (n = 1). Mobile phones were used for surveillance, prevention, diagnosis, and communication demonstrating good performance, acceptance and usability by users, as well as feasibility of mobile phone under real life conditions and effectiveness in terms of contributing to a reduction of vectors/ disease and improving users-oriented behaviour changes. It can be concluded that there are benefits for using mobile phones in the fight against arboviral diseases as well as other epidemic diseases. Further studies particularly on acceptance, cost and effectiveness at scale are recommended.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the face of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) physical distancing mandates, community-engaged research (CER) faces new vulnerabilities in the equitable inclusion of communities within research partnerships aiming to address these very inequities. METHODS: We convened a series of virtual meetings with our CER partnership to discuss the current state of activities and to identify considerations for remote community engagement. We outlined and expanded recommendations through iterative, partnered discussions to inform protections against new CER susceptibilities. RESULTS: This article presents CER recommendations in translational COVID-19 research for health equity, including increasing accessibility for remote engagement, promoting opportunities for bi-directional knowledge exchange, committing to a community-centered workforce, and leveraging novel opportunities within community-academic partnerships. CONCLUSION: Researchers conducting CER face an opportunity to reimagine community engagement remotely for partnered resilience to ensure the voices of the most affected are appropriately and inclusively integrated into all aspects of decision-making within the COVID-19 research, practice, and policymaking continuum.

AB  - During any emerging infectious disease outbreak, people with symptoms of the illness are asked to report to a health service immediately to facilitate contact tracing. Several factors may influence a person's willingness to report symptoms and their ability to access healthcare services. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic. To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak, we conducted a rapid review of the evidence. Studies included in the review were based on primary research, published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English, included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare, and were related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak. Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: accurate and informative communication about the disease and the need to seek help, symptom severity, concern about disease exposure, ease of access to healthcare facilities, and relationship with the healthcare provider. Seven themes were identified as barriers to symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: lack of knowledge of the disease and its treatment, fear of the disease and fear of subsequent treatments or requirements, stigmatization attached to having a disease, invasion of privacy, low concern about symptoms, economic consequences of disease diagnosis, and challenges related to attending a healthcare facility. For contract tracing services to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity, and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be used to evaluate information provided to the public to ensure as many people as possible with relevant symptoms report them to a healthcare provider.

AB  - We report a rapid isothermal method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The procedure uses a novel reverse transcriptase-free (RTF) approach for converting RNA into DNA, which triggers a rapid amplification using the Exponential Amplification Reaction (EXPAR). Deploying the RNA-to-DNA conversion and amplification stages of the RTF-EXPAR assay in a single step results in the detection of a sample of patient SARS-CoV-2 RNA in under 5 minutes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was funded by the Midlands Integrative Bioscience Training Partnership funded by the Biotechnology and Bioscience Research Council (BB/R506175/1).

AB  - Moral injury emerged in the healthcare discussion quite recently because of the difficulties and challenges healthcare workers and healthcare systems face in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moral injury involves a deep emotional wound and is unique to those who bear witness to intense human suffering and cruelty. This article aims to synthesise the very limited evidence from empirical studies on moral injury and to discuss a better understanding of the concept of moral injury, its importance in the healthcare context and its relation to the well-known concept of moral distress. A scoping literature review design was used to support the discussion. Systematic literature searches conducted in April 2020 in two electronic databases, PubMed/Medline and PsychInfo, produced 2044 hits but only a handful of empirical papers, from which seven well-focused articles were identified. The concept of moral injury was considered under other concepts as well such as stress of conscience, regrets for ethical situation, moral distress and ethical suffering, guilt without fault, and existential suffering with inflicting pain. Nurses had witnessed these difficult ethical situations when faced with unnecessary patient suffering and a feeling of not doing enough. Some cases of moral distress may turn into moral residue and end in moral injury with time, and in certain circumstances and contexts. The association between these concepts needs further investigation and confirmation through empirical studies; in particular, where to draw the line as to when moral distress turns into moral injury, leading to severe consequences. Given the very limited research on moral injury, discussion of moral injury in the context of the duty to care, for example, in this pandemic settings and similar situations warrants some consideration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The long-term physiological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection are not known. The ability of COVID-19 to cause chronic illness, sarcopenia, and physical deconditioning may be underestimated and go beyond the anticipated respiratory sequelae. Myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia are common symptoms even in mild to moderate cases and have the potential to exacerbate frailty. How this impacts on risk-stratification for patients requiring surgery for time-critical conditions, such as malignancy, requires further urgent investigation. MAIN BODY: The deleterious effect of sarcopenia and poor physical capacity are well recognised in cancer surgery. This review commentary highlights current evidence which suggests skeletal muscle as an under recognised cause of COVID-19-related functional deconditioning. The mechanisms behind this are via direct (viral induced myositis, nutritional decline, cytokine-mediated myopathy) and indirect mechanisms (social isolation, inactivity, and psychological consequences). CONCLUSION: Further mechanistic research is required to explore the processes behind the deconditioning effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how this impacts on treatment of malignant disease.

AB  - Due to similarities in initial disease presentation, clinicians may be inclined to repeatedly test community-acquired pneumonia cases for COVID-19 before recognizing the need to test for Legionnaires' disease. Legionnaires' disease is an illness characterized by pneumonia that has a summer/early fall seasonality due to favorable conditions for Legionella growth and exposure. Legionella proliferate in warm water environments and stagnant sections of indoor plumbing and cooling systems. During the ongoing pandemic crisis, exposures to aerosolized water from recently reopened office or retail buildings should be considered as an epidemiologic risk factor for Legionella exposure and an indication to test. The majority of Legionnaires' disease cases occurring each year are not diagnosed, and some experts recommend that all patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia without a known etiology be tested for Legionella infection. Proper diagnosis can increase the likelihood of appropriate and timely antibiotic treatment, identify potential clusters of disease, and facilitate source attribution.

AB  - Approximately 75% of farmworkers in the United States are Latino migrants, and about 50% of hired farmworkers do not have authorization to work in the United States. Farmworkers face numerous chemical, physical, and biological threats to their health. The adverse effects of these hazards may be amplified among Latino migrant farmworkers, who are concurrently exposed to various psychosocial stressors. Factors such as documentation status, potential lack of authorization to work in the United States, and language and cultural barriers may also prevent Latino migrants from accessing federal aid, legal assistance, and health programs. These environmental, occupational, and social hazards may further exacerbate existing health disparities among US Latinos. This population is also likely to be disproportionately impacted by emerging threats, including climate change and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Latino migrant farmworkers are essential to agriculture in the United States, and actions are needed to protect this vulnerable population. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 42 is April 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

AB  - Objectives: Patients are mask-free during dental attention. In addition, dentists and dental staff after working for hours need to hydrate or eat. Removing the mask makes them vulnerable to the risk of contamination. For those cases, a prophylactic decontamination protocol could be useful as an adjunct to the most recommended biosecurity protocols. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the published evidence about the use of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 and to propose a prophylactic protocol for dental attention using PVP-I during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: An electronic search in Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Scielo databases was performed up to July 24, 2020, to identify relevant literature focusing on Povidone Iodine, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS-COV, MERS, antiviral mouthwashes, and oral cavity. Results: Clinical studies on the virucidal effectiveness of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been reported. We identify a recent in vitro study showing PVP-I effectiveness at 0.5, 1, and 1.5% within 15s of contact. Moreover, another in vitro study has shown ≥99.99% virucidal activity as 1% mouthwash and 0.45% throat spray. The only study in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients reported a significant 3h drop in viral load after rinsing with 15 mL of 1% PVP-I for 1min. Conclusions: Although no clinical trials have reported the efficacy of PVP-I on SARS-CoV-2, recent studies in patients with positive PCR to SARS-CoV-2 found a significant 3-h drop in viral load. We believe that an oral prophylactic protocol with PVP-I for dental healthcare workers and patients as an adjunct to the current biosecurity protocol could minimize the transmission risk during COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In the first stages of the pandemic, the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 were significantly higher in men than in women most likely as the effect of biological, hormonal, metabolic differences between the two sexes. However, gender-related differences in lifestyles and social roles can also greatly influence the course of disease. To fully understand the influence of gender in the COVID-19 outbreak, the collection and dissemination of disaggregated data must be enhanced to allow a better knowledge of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in men and women, not only from a biomedical point of view, but also considering the risk factors associated with the different roles that they play in the society.

AB  - Segmentation is a complex task, faced by radiologists and researchers as radiomics and machine learning grow in potentiality. The process can either be automatic, semi-automatic, or manual, the first often not being sufficiently precise or easily reproducible, and the last being excessively time consuming when involving large districts with high-resolution acquisitions. A high-resolution CT of the chest is composed of hundreds of images, and this makes the manual approach excessively time consuming. Furthermore, the parenchymal alterations require an expert evaluation to be discerned from the normal appearance; thus, a semi-automatic approach to the segmentation process is, to the best of our knowledge, the most suitable when segmenting pneumonias, especially when their features are still unknown. For the studies conducted in our institute on the imaging of COVID-19, we adopted 3D Slicer, a freeware software produced by the Harvard University, and combined the threshold with the paint brush instruments to achieve fast and precise segmentation of aerated lung, ground glass opacities, and consolidations. When facing complex cases, this method still requires a considerable amount of time for proper manual adjustments, but provides an extremely efficient mean to define segments to use for further analysis, such as the calculation of the percentage of the affected lung parenchyma or texture analysis of the ground glass areas.

AB  - 2020 has certainly been a year of challenges for nurses and healthcare workers around the world with the relentless spread of COVID-19. These challenges are many, including countries and health systems not being prepared for a pandemic, shortages of personal protective equipment and acute shortages of nurses, poor communication from governments and the lack of accurate data regarding COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among nurses and health workers. Nurses are suffering from psychological distress and are exhausted and burntout as the pandemic's second wave moves around the world. Many have been subjected to violence and aggression from people in their communities. Against this backdrop, nurses' contributions have been vital in saving lives and the profession has learnt many powerful lessons that will resonate in nursing practice for the future. But governments must do more, including ensuring nurses receive vaccinations early to protect them when a successful vaccine becomes available.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a condition caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe cases of COVID-19 result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. A detrimental, hyper-inflammatory immune response with excess release of cytokines is the main driver of disease development and of tissue damage in these patients. Thus, repurposing of biologic agents and other pharmacological inhibitors of cytokines used for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions emerged as a logical therapeutic strategy to quench inflammation and improve the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Evaluated agents include the interleukin one receptor blocker anakinra, monoclonal antibodies inhibiting IL-6 tocilizumab and sarilumab, monoclonal antibodies inhibiting granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor, and Janus kinase inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic options based on direct personal experience and on published evidence from observational studies and randomized clinical trials.

AB  - Insitu simulation can be used to improve care within a particular setting and has specific value in developing and testing guidelines and procedures. However, it can be challenging to undertake simulation when clinical work is ongoing. Responding to the need to develop infection prevention and control procedures for coronavirus disease 2019 in the obstetric operating theatre, we asked three patients who required operative intervention to consent to be managed according to preliminary standard operating procedures as if they were severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 positive. With this method, we were able to run scenarios in real-time without interrupting clinical work. As well as allowing us to develop and refine procedures, these 'live simulations' provided staff training and highlighted system problems that needed to be addressed as the first wave of the pandemic approached. In this case series, we describe our procedure for live simulation, report the learning points that this approach yielded, present the feedback from patient participants and reflect on the ethical implications of this technique.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Numerous scientific journal articles related to COVID-19 have been rapidly published, making navigation and understanding of relationships difficult. METHODS: A graph network was constructed from the publicly available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of COVID-19-related publications using an engine leveraging medical knowledge bases to identify discrete medical concepts and an open-source tool (Gephi) to visualise the network. RESULTS: The network shows connections between diseases, medications and procedures identified from the title and abstract of 195 958 COVID-19-related publications (CORD-19 Dataset). Connections between terms with few publications, those unconnected to the main network and those irrelevant were not displayed. Nodes were coloured by knowledge base and the size of the node related to the number of publications containing the term. The data set and visualisations were made publicly accessible via a webtool. CONCLUSION: Knowledge management approaches (text mining and graph networks) can effectively allow rapid navigation and exploration of entity inter-relationships to improve understanding of diseases such as COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the gender distribution of clinical trial leadership in COVID-19 clinical trials. METHODS: We searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io API (application programming interface). The repository of the datasets used to collect and analyse the data available at https://osf.io/k2r57/. RESULTS: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators (PIs) among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared to 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p<0.005) and T2DM (p<0.005) trials over the same period, respectively. During this "pre-study" period, the proportion of PIs who were predicted to be women were 49.7% (245/493) and 44.4% (148/333) for breast cancer and T2DM trials, respectively and the difference was not statistically significant when compared to results from the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that less than one-third of COVID-19-related clinical trials are led by women PIs, half the proportion observed in non-COVID-19 trials over the same period which remained similar to the pre-study period. These gender disparities during the pandemic may indicate not only a lack of women's leadership in international clinical trials and involvement in new projects but also may reveal imbalances in women's access to research activities and funding during health emergencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has declared that a pandemic situation exists in relation to the disease caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19. So far, the absence of a vaccine against the new coronavirus has led people worldwide to seek various therapeutic alternatives, including use of cholecalciferol. DESIGN AND SETTING: Narrative review developed by a research group at a public university in Recife (PE), Brazil. METHODS: We searched the literature on the use of cholecalciferol for prevention or treatment of COVID-19, using the MEDLINE and LILACS databases, with the keywords "vitamin D", "cholecalciferol", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19" and "coronavirus", from January 1, 2020, to June 10, 2020. Narrative reviews, cohort studies and ecological studies were selected. RESULTS: We retrieved 32 references, of which 8 were considered eligible for intensive review and critical analysis. These comprised five narrative reviews, two observational studies and one protocol proposal. Most of the studies selected reported positive effects from use of vitamin D for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, there was little quantitative data to assess the real impact of using this vitamin as an intervention against this disease. CONCLUSIONS: Current studies on vitamin D used for purposes other than bone health promotion cannot be taken as support to justify its use in a disease as recent as COVID-19. Studies of greater robustness, with higher levels of clinical evidence, need to be conducted. Rational use of this vitamin needs to be ensured, thereby minimizing the impacts on the patient and the public healthcare system.

AB  - In this research, statistical models are formulated to study the effect of the health crisis arising from COVID-19 in global markets. Breakpoints in the price series of stock indexes are considered. Such indexes are used as an approximation of the stock markets in different countries, taking into account that they are indicative of these markets because of their composition. The main results obtained in this investigation highlight that countries with better institutional and economic conditions are less affected by the pandemic. In addition, the effect of the health index in the models is associated with their non-significant parameters. This is due to that the health index used in the modeling would not determine the different capacities of the countries analyzed to respond efficiently to the pandemic effect. Therefore, the contagion is the preponderant factor when analyzing the structural breakdown that occurred in the world economy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Protein drug targets play a significant choice in different stages of the drug discovery process. There is an urgent need to understand the drug discovery approaches and protein drug targets (PDT) of SARS-CoV-2, with structural insights for the development of SARS-CoV-2 drugs through targeted therapeutic approach. AREAS COVERED: We have described the protein as a drug target class and also discussed various drug discovery approaches for SARS-CoV-2 involving the protein drug targets such as drug repurposing study, designing of viral entry inhibitors, viral replication inhibitors and different enzymes of the virus. We have performed comprehensive literature search from the popular databases such as PubMed Google scholar, Web of Science and Scopus. Finally, we have illustrated the structural landscape of different significant viral proteins (3CLpro or Mpro, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, S protein) and host proteins as drug targets (cathepsin L, furin, TMPRSS2, ACE2). EXPERT OPINION: The structural landscape of PDT with their binding pockets, and significant residues involved in binding has been discussed further to better understand the PDT and the structure-based drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2. This attempt will increase more therapeutic options, and combination therapies with a multi-target strategy.

AB  - Globally, it is established that the partial lockdown system assists to improve the health of the total environment due to inadequate anthropogenic actions in different economic sectors. The ample research on fitness of environment has been proved that the strict imposition of lockdown was the blessings of environment. The river Damodar has historical significance and lifeline for huge population of Jharkhand and West Bengal state of India but in the recent years the water quality has been deteriorated due to untreated industrial effluents and urban sewage. The main objective of this study is to examine the water quality of river Damodar during and prelockdown phase for domestic use and restoration of river ecosystem. A total of eleven (11) effluent discharge sites were selected in prelockdown and during lockdown phase. A new approach of water quality assessment, i.e., water pollution index (WPI) has been applied in this study. WPI is weightage free, unbiased method to analysis of water quality. The result shows that the physical, chemical and heavy elements were found beyond the standard limit in prelockdown period. The cation and anion were arranged in an order of Na2+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ and Cl- > So4- > No3- > F- in both the sessions. WPI of prelockdown showed that about 100% water samples are of highly polluted. WPI of lockdown period showed that around 90.90% samples improved to 'good quality' and 9.10% of samples are of 'moderately polluted.' Hypothesis testing by 't' test proved that there was a significant difference (ρ = 0.05%) in values of each parameter between two periods. Null hypothesis was rejected and indicated the improvement of river water quality statistically. Spatial mapping using Arc GIS 10.4 interpolation (IDW) helps to understand spatial intensity of pollution load in two periods. This research study should be helpful for further management and spatial diagnosis of water resource of river Damodar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, Wuhan City in Hubei Province, China witnessed an outbreak of a novel type of coronavirus (COVID-19), named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The sharp rise in the number of infected cases and the surge spike in fatalities worldwide prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare this rapid outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. The economic, health, and social ramifications of COVID-19 induced fear and anxiety all over the world. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to discuss how precautionary measures and restrictions imposed by governments, such as quarantines, lockdowns, and social distancing, have not only caused economic losses, but also a rise in mental health problems specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: A deep comprehensive analysis review in of the relevant literature regarding the pandemic and its debilitating consequences on the psychological status of the public were was discussed performed. RESULTS: This review illustrates that the COVID-19 pandemic had a traumatic impact on the psychological functioning of the public, particularly COVID-19 survivors, older adults, and healthcare workers, in particularly, due to the difficulties in coping with new realities and uncertainties. CONCLUSION: In this review, we have discussed the psychological implications of this pandemic and we have provided an extensive background for understanding options regarding PTSD management in healthy individuals and those with preexisting conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has claimed more than one million lives, besides causing hardship and disruptions. The Fleischner Society has recommended chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting cases with high risk for disease progression, for triaging suspected patients with moderate-to-severe illness, and to eliminate false negatives in areas with high pre-test probability or limited resources. Although CXR is less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. Literature search was performed using PubMed. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features is associated with worse disease outcome. Recognition of these features on CXR will improve accuracy and speed of diagnosing COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 caused substantial casualty worldwide. As the reported renal involvement varied across regions, we sought to review the global prevalence of renal manifestations among COVID-19 patients and determine the risk factors associated with AKI. Methods: We systematically searched 6 databases for peer-reviewed reports and 7 data portals for grey literature for all trials, cohorts, case-control studies and case-series that reported the prevalence of renal manifestations including AKI, RRT, proteinuria and hematuria, and their associated risk factors. All papers were screened, assessed and extracted by at least 2 researchers independently. Quality was assessed according to NIH assessment tools. To avoid duplicate of patient data, we matched the location, institution and time period, and only included the largest data source if studies overlapped. Prevalence of renal manifestations was pooled from studies that consecutively recruited patients from the general population, and with clear definition of outcome. This review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020184621). Results: 36 studies from 8 countries and over 50 cities with a total of 14,712 patients were identified. 34 and 2 were cohorts and case-control studies respectively. 24, 7 and 5 studies reported COVID-19 patients from the general population, severe / critical patients and patients with history of RRT. AKI occurred in 14.3% of all COVID-19 cases and was highest in New York City. 4.7% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent RRT. Proteinuria and hematuria were present in 42.5% and 26.7% of all COVID-19 cases. The odds of mortality among COVID-19 patients who developed AKI was 15 times higher than non-AKI COVID-19 patients (pooled OR=16.85, 95% CI: 10.06 to 28.23, 2 cities, 6 studies, 9,297 patients) and was higher in Hubei. Such effect was not observed among kidney transplant patients (pooled OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.12 to 7.22, 2 studies, 30 patients). Higher C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine levels on admission were associated with AKI. Conclusions: AKI was prevalent among COVID-19 patients and significantly associated with mortality. The odds of mortality among AKI patients varied significantly between cities, which could be associated with differences in healthcare infrastructure and delayed hospitalization and treatment initiation.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Respiratory acidosis is commonly present in patients with respiratory failure. The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained. SUMMARY: There is a lack of clinical evidence that administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, associated with the economic consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, has led to mental health consequences among people worldwide. Protecting the mental well-being of populations is an imperative component of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. This scoping review attempts to present an overview of the existing tools to measure COVID-19-related mental health problems. Methods: Literature search was conducted in the PubMed electronic database using developed key search terms. Reference lists of the identified eligible articles were reviewed to locate relevant articles missed from the electronic database search. Fifteen scales measuring COVID-19-associated mental health problems, validated among diverse populations across the world, were included in this review. Results: The majority of these scales were validated among middle-aged adults in Turkey. Only a few validated scales encompass the negative socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. None of the available scales focused on the aspects of suicidal ideation or behavioral responses/coping strategies, neither were they inclusive of participants from diverse age, geographic, and COVID-19 exposure groups. Conclusion: This scoping review highlights the need for future research to develop and validate comprehensive psychometric tools to assess COVID-19-associated mental health problems. Also, in view of the vulnerable nature of healthcare professionals for developing mental health concerns in the course of providing services for COVID-19-affected individuals, future psychometric research needs to concentrate on the development of measures specific for these professionals.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The virus uses ACE2 receptor for viral entry. ACE2 is part of the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is also expressed in the lower respiratory tract along the alveolar epithelium. There is, however, significant controversy regarding the role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Some have argued that decreasing ACE2 expression would result in decreased susceptibility to the virus by decreasing available binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 and restricting viral entry into the cells. Others have argued that, like the pathogenesis of other viral pneumonias, including those stemming from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, once SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it downregulates ACE2 expression. Lack of the favourable effects of ACE2 might exaggerate lung injury by a variety of mechanisms. In order to help address this controversy, we conducted a literature search and review of relevant preclinical and clinical publications pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, viral pneumonia, SARS, acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Our review suggests, although controversial, that patients at increased susceptibility to COVID-19 complications may have reduced baseline ACE2, and by modulating ACE2 expression one can possibly improve COVID-19 outcomes. Herein, we elucidate why and how this potential mechanism might work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Graft thrombosis due to fabric delamination is a rare cause of delayed failure of arteriovenous grafts. Graft delamination is primarily an imaging diagnosis and is confirmed with the help of ultrasound which shows the separation of graft fabric layers. Only two such cases have been described in the literature so far. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of upper extremity arteriovenous graft thrombosis in a 79 year old COVID-19 positive patient with end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis was established on ultrasonography which revealed separation of the graft fabric layers with thrombosis within the "false" and "true" lumen of the graft. The patient was managed with angioplasty and embolectomy of the clot material followed by stent-graft placement across the delaminated portion of the graft. Post-procedural angiography confirmed brisk flow across the graft and patient could successfully have subsequent hemodialysis sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of graft delamination as a cause of graft failure is important as its management differs from other conventional causes since it requires stent-grafts to cover the area of delamination to re-establish flow and salvage the AV graft. The recognition of this phenomenon is essential to provide quality care and successful reuse of the AV graft. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, Case Report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of mental health problems and substance abuse in the migrant population is higher than the general population. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and pattern of mental health issues and substance use in the migrant population and highlight the association with the reverse migration of migrant workers. METHODOLOGY: The field staff visited the shelter homes for migrant population in four cities of Northern India (Chandigarh (UT), Bhatinda (Punjab), Panchkula (Haryana) and Jaipur (Rajasthan). After maintaining the social distance and wearing masks by the staff and migrants, written informed consent was taken for participation in the study. The socio-demographic details of reverse migrants were noted down and Hindi version of Primary Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for mental health problems and screening tool for pattern of substance abuse was administered. Geographically matched undisplaced were also administered these tools. RESULTS: A total of 275 reverse migrants and 276 undisplaced were included in the study. The prevalence of ever use for all the substances among reverse migrants was 44.4% (122/275) and among undisplaced, it was 45.3%. The prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis was higher than the general population. The prevalence of at least one diagnosis on PHQ-9 is 13.45% (reverse migrants 19.3% and undisplaced 7.6) and the prevalence of other depressive disorder is significantly higher in reverse migrants (17.1%) than undisplaced (4.0%). CONCLUSION: The study concludes that prevalence of mental health issues and substance abuse in migrant population is significantly higher than the general population and the prevalence of at least one diagnosis and other depressive disorder is significantly higher in reverse migrants than undisplaced.

AB  - Background: Coronaviruses are pathogens that affect animals and humans, causing neurologic, respiratory, intestinal, and hepatic diseases. Six coronaviruses are known to cause disease in humans. The current pandemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, where the first case of pneumonia was reported on December 12, 2019. In February of 2020, the World Health Organization named the virus COVID-19 and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named it SARS-CoV-2. By April 30, 2020, more than 3 000 000 cases were confirmed worldwide, affecting 185 countries, with over 200 000 deaths and approximately 420 000 recoveries. Relevance: A literature review was carried out to provide urologists with the current status of the disease in Mexico, the pathophysiology of the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the latest updates on the different treatment options for COVID-19. Conclusions: Because we form part of the healthcare system, it is necessary for urologists to have the latest information on this disease of worldwide importance, given that we are involved with the management of COVID-19 patients at certain hospital centers.

AB  - In view of the recent global pandemic caused by COVID-19 intense efforts have been devoted worldwide towards the development of an effective treatment for this disease. Recently, PDE4 inhibitors have been suggested to attenuate the cytokine storm in COVID-19 especially tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In our effort we have explored the 2-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-b]quinoxalines for this purpose because of their potential inhibitory properties of PDE-4 / TNF-α. Moreover, several of these compounds appeared to be promising in silico when assessed for their binding affinities via docking into the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD) of N-protein of SARS-CoV-2. A rapid and one-pot synthesis of this class of molecules was achieved via the Cu-catalyzed coupling-cyclization-desulfinylation of 3-alkynyl-2-chloroquinoxalines with t-butyl sulfinamide as the ammonia surrogate under ultrasound irradiation. Most of these compounds showed good to significant inhibition of TNF-α in vitro establishing a SAR (Structure Activity Relationship) within the series. One compound e.g. 3i was identified as a promising hit for which the desirable ADME and acceptable toxicity profile was predicted in silico.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of COVID-19 has overwhelmed the blood supply chain worldwide and severely influenced the clinical procedures with potential massive blood loss, such as clipping surgery for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is safe and effective in aneurysm clipping remains largely unknown. METHODS: aSAH patients who underwent clipping surgery within 72 hours from bleeding were included. The patient in the ANH group received 400 mL autologous blood collection, and the blood was returned as needed during surgery. The relationships between ANH and perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, postoperative outcome, complications were analyzed. RESULTS: 62 aSAH patients were included between December 2019 and June 2020, 20 in ANH group and 42 in non-ANH group. ANH did not reduce the need of perioperative blood transfusion (3 [15%] vs 5 [11.9%], P = 0.734). However, ANH significantly increased serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (11.5 ± 2.5 g/dL vs 10.3 ± 2.0 g/dL, P = 0.045) and day 3 (12.1 ± 2.0 g/dL vs 10.7 ± 1.3 g/dL, P = 0.002). Multivariable analysis indicated that serum hemoglobin levels on postoperative day 1 (OR =0.895, 95% CI = 0.822-0.973, P = 0.010) was an independent risk factors for unfavorable outcome, and ROC curve analysis showed that it had a comparable predictive power as WFNS grade (Z =0.275, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ANH significantly increased postoperative hemoglobin levels, and it may hold the potential to improve patients' outcomes. Routine use of ANH should be considered in aneurysm clipping surgery.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in humans and poses a great threat to public health worldwide. Clinical data shows a disturbed type I interferon (IFN) response during the virus infection. In this study, we discovered that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in the inhibition of interferon beta (IFN-β) production. N protein repressed IFN-β production induced by poly(I:C) or upon Sendai virus (SeV) infection. We noted that N protein also suppressed IFN-β production, induced by several signaling molecules downstream of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway, which is the crucial pattern recognition receptor (PRR) responsible for identifying RNA viruses. Moreover, our data demonstrated that N protein interacted with the RIG-I protein through the DExD/H domain, which has ATPase activity and plays an important role in the binding of immunostimulatory RNAs. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 N protein suppresses the IFN-β response through targeting the initial step, potentially the cellular PRR-RNA-recognition step in the innate immune pathway. Therefore, we propose that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein represses IFN-β production by interfering with RIG-I.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread, resulting in considerable casualties and serious economic loss worldwide. Disease severity and related symptoms markedly vary among individuals. A large number of patients present atypical symptoms, which represent a big challenge for early diagnosis and prompt infection source isolation. Currently, COVID-19 diagnosis predominantly depends on nucleic acid tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens, but this method presents a high rate of false negative results. Therefore, serum antibody measurement has been rapidly developed as a supplementary method with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy. Further, serum antibody levels might help to identify the infection stage, asymptomatic carriers, and patients with diverging severities and to monitor convalescent plasma therapy. In the current review, we aim to present comprehensive evidence to clarify the utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients as a reference for use in the clinic.

AB  - Background and Aim: At the end of 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 had a significant impact on China's tourism industry, which was almost at a standstill in the short-term. After reaching the preliminarily stable state, the government and the scenic area management department implemented a series of incentive policies in order to speed up the recovery of the tourism industry. Therefore, analyzing all sorts of social effects after policy implementation is of guiding significance for the government and the scenic areas. Methods: Targeted as the social effect with the implementation of tourism promotion policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper briefly analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on the national cultural and tourism industry and selects several representative types of tourism policies, crawls the comment data of Weibo users, analyzes users' perception and emotional preference to the policy, and thus mines the social effect of various policies. Subsequently, by identifying the social effects of various policies as dependent variables, a binary logistic regression model is constructed to obtain the best combination of tourism promotion policies and promote the rapid revitalization of the cultural and tourism industry. Results: The results show that from the single policy, the social effect of the "safety" policy is the best. From the perspective of combination policies, the simultaneous release of "safety" policies and "economy" policies have the greatest social impact, which can dramatically accelerate the recovery of the cultural and tourism industry. Finally, this paper proposes suggestions for policy formulation to improve the ability of the cultural tourism industry to cope with crisis events. Conclusion: These results explain the perceived effects of the public on the government policies and can be used to judge whether the policies have been released in place. Based on the above results, corresponding suggestions are proposed as follows: 1) the combination of economic policies and security policies can achieve better results; and 2) the role of "opinion leaders" can be played to improve the perceived effect of policies.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic disease with high morbidity and mortality. Inflammatory and thrombosis are its main manifestations. As an important organ of hemofiltration metabolism, the kidney is prone to blockage and destruction when filter high inflammatory and high viscous blood of COVID-19, resulting in the loss of a large amount of protein, aggravating blood concentration, and then worsening COVID-19 hypercoagulability, which may explain the phenomenon of erythrocytes aggregation blocking the capillary lumen and the main reason why the kidney has become the second largest involvement organs. Therefore, this review discusses the effects of pathophysiological mechanisms such as inflammatory storm, endothelial injury, phosphatidylserine expression, extracellular traps release on renal capillary thrombosis caused by COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, in view of the above mechanisms, we put forward the potential targets of antithrombotic therapy, and graded management of patients, reasonable use of drugs according to the severity of the disease and the choice of time. And we support the view of prevention of thrombus before admission, continuous anticoagulation and drug choice after discharge. It is suggested that the symptomatic and supportive treatment of renal disease in critically ill patients should be combined with the concept of antithrombotic therapy. The ultimate goal is to reduce the occurrence and development of kidney disease, provide direction for the current management of COVID-19 with kidney disease, and reduce the mortality of COVID-19.

AB  - The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was listed as an endangered species under the Wildlife Conservation Act in Taiwan in 2009. However, no study has evaluated the possible direct or indirect effects of pathogens on the Taiwanese leopard cat population. Here, we targeted viral pathogens, including carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (genus Protoparvovirus), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronaviruses (CoVs), and canine distemper virus (CDV), through molecular screening. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we clarified the phylogenetic relationship of viral pathogens isolated from leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 live-trapped leopard cats and 29 that were found dead were collected from 2015 to 2019 in Miaoli County in northwestern Taiwan. Protoparvoviruses and CoVs were detected in leopard cats, and their prevalence (95% confidence interval) was 63.5% (50.4%-76.6%) and 8.8% (0%-18.4%), respectively. Most of the protoparvovirus sequences amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All of the CoV sequences amplified from leopard cats were identified as feline CoV. No spatial or temporal aggregation of protoparvovirus infection in leopard cats was found in the sampling area, indicating a wide distribution of protoparvoviruses in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the identified pathogens. We strongly recommend management of protoparvoviruses and feline CoV in the leopard cat habitat, particularly vaccination programs and population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, has been a tragic disaster to people all over the world. As there is no specific drug for COVID-19, neutralizing antibodies are attracting more and more attention as one of the most effective means to combat the pandemic. Here, we introduced the etiological and serological characteristics of COVID-19, discussed the current stage of development of human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and summarized the antigenic epitopes in the S glycoprotein, which may deepen the understanding of the profile of immune recognition and response against SARS-CoV-2 and provide insight for the design of effective vaccines and antibody-based therapies.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019 became a global pandemic. The 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) process viral polyproteins to yield mature non-structural proteins, thus playing an important role in the CoV life cycle and therefore is considered a prominent target for anti-viral drugs. To date, many 3CLpro inhibitors have been reported, and their molecular mechanisms have been illustrated. Here, we briefly introduce the structural features of 3CLpro of the human-related SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and explore the potency and mechanism of their cognate inhibitors. This information will shed light on the development and optimization of CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, which may benefit further designation of therapeutic strategies to treat CoV diseases.

AB  - Shortages in N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are significant as FFRs are essential for the protection of healthcare professionals and other high-risk groups against Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In response to these shortages during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) permitting FFR decontamination and reuse. However, although industrial decontamination services are available at some large institutions, FFR decontamination is not widely available. Effective FFR decontamination must 1) deactivate the virus; 2) preserve FFR integrity, specifically fit and filtering capability; and 3) be non-toxic and safe. Here we identify and compare at-home methods for heat-based FFR decontamination that meet these requirements, but utilize common household appliances. Our results identify viable protocols for simple and accessible FFR decontamination, while also highlighting methods that may jeopardize FFR integrity and should be avoided.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThis study does not classify as a clinical trialFunding StatementThe Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia University provided funding to support this project.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Columbia University Institutional Review Board reviewed this study's protocol and determined that ethical approval could be waived (IRB reference AAAT5503)All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the normal socioeconomic operation of countries worldwide, causing major economic losses and deaths and posing great challenges to the sustainable development of cities that play a leading role in national socioeconomic development. The strength of urban resilience determines the speed of urban social and economic recovery. This paper constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban resilience under the COVID-19 pandemic scenario considering four dimensions-economy, ecology, infrastructure, and social systems-conducted a quantitative evaluation of urban resilience in the Yangtze River Delta of China, revealed its spatiotemporal differences and change trends, and proposed targeted strategies for improving urban resilience. The results show that (1) the Yangtze River Delta urban resilience system is growing stronger every year, but there are significant differences in the level of urban resilience, its spatial distribution and regional urban resilience. (2) In the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, there is less distribution of areas with a higher resilience index, while those with high and medium resilience levels are more distributed. However, the resilience of most cities is low. (3) The resilience index of eastern coastal cities is significantly higher, and the resilience of cities under the COVID-19 scenario presents obvious east-west differentiation. (4) When constructing urban resilience, the individual situation of cities should be taken into account, measures adjusted according to local conditions, reasonable lessons drawn from effective international urban resilience construction, and reasonable planning policies formulated; it is important to give play to the relationship between the whole and the parts of resilience to achieve unified and coordinated development.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 produced by SARS-CoV-2 is sweeping the world in a very short time. Although much has been learned about the clinical course, prognostic inflammatory markers, and disease complications of COVID-19, the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the thyroid is poorly understood. In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, limited available evidence indicates there is no pathological evidence of thyroid injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, subacute thyroiditis (SAT) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been reported for the first time. Thyroid dysfunction is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. By contrast, certain thyroid diseases may have a negative impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19. In addition, some anti-COVID-19 agents may cause thyroid injury or affect its metabolism. COVID-19 and thyroid disease may mutually aggravate the disease burden. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should not ignore the effect in thyroid function, especially when there are obvious related symptoms. In addition, patients with thyroid diseases should follow specific management principles during the epidemic period.

AB  - Identifying drugs that regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its symptoms has been a pressing area of investigation during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). As PGs play diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses, inhibiting PG production with NSAIDs could affect COVID-19 pathogenesis in multiple ways, including: (1) altering susceptibility to infection by modifying expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; (2) regulating replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells; and (3) modulating the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigate these potential roles. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates COX-2 in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2 by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. In contrast, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, NSAID treatment reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by reduced neutralizing antibody titers. Our findings indicate that NSAID treatment may influence COVID-19 outcomes by dampening the inflammatory response and production of protective antibodies rather than modifying susceptibility to infection or viral replication.ImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which are critical for the generation of prostaglandins - lipid molecules with diverse roles in homeostasis and inflammation. Inhibition of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs could therefore have multiple effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that NSAID treatment reduced both the antibody and pro-inflammatory cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of NSAIDs to modulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has important implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis in patients. Whether this occurs in humans and whether it is beneficial or detrimental to the host remains an important area of future investigation. This also raises the possibility that NSAIDs may alter the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of asymptomatic infections in the transmission of COVID-19 have drawn considerable attention. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological and radiographical characteristics of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19. METHODS: Data on the epidemiological and radiographical characteristics of asymptomatic infections were extracted. Pooled proportions with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 104 studies involving 20,152 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among those with COVID-19 was 13.34% (10.86%-16.29%), among which the presymptomatic and covert infections were 7.64% (4.02%-14.04%) and 8.44% (5.12%-13.62%), respectively. The proportions of asymptomatic infections among infected children and healthcare workers were 32.24% (23.08%-42.13%) and 36.96% (18.51%-60.21%), respectively. The proportion of asymptomatic infections was significantly higher after 2020/02/29 than before (33.53% vs 10.19%) and in non-Asian regions than in Asia (28.76% vs 11.54%). The median viral shedding duration of asymptomatic infections was 14.14 days (11.25-17.04). A total of 47.62% (31.13%-72.87%) of asymptomatic infections showed lung abnormalities, especially ground-glass opacity 41.11% (19.7%-85.79%). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic infections were more often found in infected children and healthcare workers, and they increased after 2020/02/29 and in non-Asian regions. Chest radiographical imaging could be conducive to early identification of asymptomatic infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is a global pandemic. Serological antibody test is one important diagnostic method increasingly used in the clinic, although its clinical application is still under investigation. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performances of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 specific antibody tests in COVID-19 patients. Test results analyzed included (1) IgM-positive but IgG-negative (IgM+IgG-), (2) IgG-positive but IgM-negative (IgG+IgM-), (3) both IgM and IgG-positive (IgM+IgG+), (4) IgM-positive without IgG information (IgM+IgG+/-), (5) IgG-positive without IgM information (IgG+IgM+/-), (6) either IgM or IgG-positive (IgM+ or IgG+), and (7) IgA-positive (IgA+). RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies were included. The pooled sensitivities of IgM+IgG-, IgG+IgM-, IgM+IgG+, IgM+IgG+/-, IgG+IgM+/-, and IgM+ or IgG+ were 6%, 7%, 53%, 68%, 73%, and 79% respectively. The pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The IgA+ had a pooled sensitivity of 78%, but a relatively low specificity of 88%. Tests conducted two weeks after symptom onset provided improved diagnostic accuracy. Chemiluminescence immunoassay and detection of S protein as the antigen could offer a more accurate diagnostic result. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the supplemental role of serological antibody tests in COVID-19 diagnosis. However, their capacity to diagnose COVID-19 early in the disease course could be limited.

AB  - The supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many manufacturers to look for alternative suppliers. How to choose a suitable alternative supplier in the COVID-19 pandemic has become an important task. To fulfill this task, this research proposes a calibrated fuzzy geometric mean (cFGM)-fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS)-fuzzy weighted intersection (FWI) approach. In the proposed methodology, first, the cFGM method is proposed to accurately derive the priorities of criteria. Subsequently, each expert applies the FTOPSIS method to compare the overall performances of alternative suppliers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The sensitivity of an expert to any change in the overall performance of the alternative supplier is also considered. Finally, the FWI operator is used to aggregate the comparison results by all experts, for which an expert's authority level is set to a value proportional to the consistency of his/her pairwise comparison results. The cFGM-FTOPSIS-FWI approach has been applied to select suitable alternative suppliers for a Taiwanese foundry in the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to analyze the mechanism of compulsory licensing of medicines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodological basis of the study encompasses the general and special methods of scientific inquiry (formal logical method, comparative law, structural-logical method, analysis and synthesis methods). The ways and possibilities of balancing the interests of rights-holders and society's interests (in particular patients' interests) have been studied. It is highlighted that compulsory licensing must be employed exclusively in view of the principle of proportionality, since any restrictions on human rights, including patent rights, must comply with the legislation in force and be proportionate to the potential threat. Comprehensive attention is paid to the interests of right holders (in our case, medicines manufacturers), their protection as well as the ways they abuse their patent rights. It is underlined that access to medicines and treatment is a prerequisite for the realization of the right to health and, consequently, is of social interest. However, in Ukraine today we face a situation in which the percentage of medicines purchased at patients' own expense is 88.2%. Such low medicines coverage on the part of the state is not characteristic of any European country. Compulsory licensing legislation, in particular, key international documents in this field, were thoroughly studied. The features of compulsory licensing have been formulated. The general trends regarding the use of this mechanism in the contemporary world have been determined. Based on the study, an evaluation of the effectiveness of compulsory licensing as a tool in the fight against abuse of patent rights is provided. There have been produced suggestions regarding amendments to the current legislation of Ukraine aiming to increase the effectiveness of compulsory licensing of medicines in general and under pandemic conditions in particular. First of all, it is an expansion of the sphere of compulsory licensing with respect to such intellectual property objects as industrial samples and trade secrets (know-hows). It is also suggested that the procedure for issuing compulsory licenses be expedited by the government's decision under pandemic or epidemic conditions.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to COVID-19. The gastrointestinal tract is now an appreciated portal of infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are inflammatory conditions caused by chronic type 2 (T2) inflammation. However, the effects of the T2 atopic inflammatory milieu on SARS-COV-2 viral entry gene expression in the GI tract is poorly understood. We analyzed tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG) and in normal adult esophagi using publicly available RNA sequencing datasets. Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared to control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared to normal adult esophagi. Type 2 immunity and pediatric age could be protective for infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract due to decreased expression of ACE2.

AB  - The rearrangement of healthcare services required to face the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a drastic reduction in elective cardiac invasive procedures. We are already facing a "second wave" of infections and we might be dealing during the next months with a "third wave" and subsequently new waves. Therefore, during the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic we have to face the problems of how to perform elective cardiac invasive procedures in non-COVID patients and which patients/procedures should be prioritised. In this context, the interplay between the pandemic stage, the availability of healthcare resources and the priority of specific cardiac disorders is crucial. Clear pathways for "hot" or presumed "hot" patients and "cold" patients are mandatory in each hospital. Depending on the local testing capacity and intensity of transmission in the area, healthcare facilities may test patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before the interventional procedure, regardless of risk assessment for COVID-19. Pre-hospital testing should always be conducted in the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 positive patients, full personal protective equipment using FFP 2/N95 masks, eye protection, gowning and gloves is indicated during cardiac interventions for healthcare workers. When patients have tested negative for COVID-19, medical masks may be sufficient. Indeed, individual patients should themselves wear medical masks during cardiac interventions and outpatient visits.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has devastated public health services and economies worldwide. Despite global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now found in over 200 countries and has caused an upward death toll of over 1 million human lives as of November 2020. To date, only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic drug (Remdesivir) and a monoclonal antibody, MAb (Bamlanivimab) are available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. As with other viruses, studying SARS-CoV-2 requires the use of secondary approaches to detect the presence of the virus in infected cells. To overcome this limitation, we have generated replication-competent recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus or mCherry) or bioluminescent (Nluc) reporter genes. Vero E6 cells infected with reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be easily detected via fluorescence or luciferase expression and display a good correlation between reporter gene expression and viral replication. Moreover, rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes have comparable plaque sizes and growth kinetics to those of wild-type virus, rSARS-CoV-2/WT. We used these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate their feasibility to identify neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) or antiviral drugs. Our results demonstrate that reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 represent an excellent option to identify therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, where reporter gene expression can be used as valid surrogates to track viral infection. Moreover, the ability to manipulate the viral genome opens the feasibility of generating viruses expressing foreign genes for their use as vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly impacted the human health and economic status worldwide. There is an urgent need to identify effective prophylactics and therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. The use of fluorescent- or luciferase-expressing reporter expressing viruses has significantly advanced viral research. Here, we generated recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 expressing fluorescent (Venus and mCherry) or luciferase (Nluc) reporter genes and demonstrate that they represent an excellent option to track viral infections in vitro. Importantly, reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 display similar growth kinetics and plaque phenotype that their wild-type counterpart (rSARS-CoV-2/WT), demonstrating their feasibility to identify drugs and/or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the therapeutic treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Henceforth, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 can be used to interrogate large libraries of compounds and/or monoclonal antibodies (MAb), in high-throughput screening settings, to identify those with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - To date, short-term funding and policy fixes for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have focused on saving the current health care system; policies have not maximized the population's health, prioritized the safety net, nor addressed the fundamental problems that have hindered our nation's response for our most vulnerable neighbors. We need to plan more lasting equity-specific reforms now. I explain 3 lessons that should inform reforms to the health care delivery and payment systems to reduce health disparities and maximize the public's health: (1) Proven roadmaps and processes for reducing health care disparities already exist, as do themes of successful interventions. Implement them; (2) Payment reform needs to create a business case for health care organizations to address social determinants of health and implement care interventions to reduce health disparities; (3) We as a nation need to have hard conversations about whether we truly value the opportunity for everyone to have a healthy life.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many comparisons have been made on the effect and impact of COVID-19 on influenza pandemics of history. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the strategies utilized by healthcare providers to improve influenza vaccination rates can similarly be applied to the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine. The purpose of this study was to determine the rationale of low influenza vaccination rates in an urban allergy clinic and how to improve patient education and knowledge regarding the importance of influenza vaccination. A three-year comparison of interventions is presented as well as its application to future COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: This study was performed at an outpatient allergy and clinical immunology practice (MSBI) with hospital affiliation in New York City, New York. A quality improvement medical committee was formed to optimize influenza vaccination rates to greater than 71% and established standardized protocols regarding patient intake workflows, vaccine counseling, and documentation. Patient records from four providers were used for this study to compare pre-and post-intervention rates. RESULTS: 984 patients met inclusion criteria, with a normal distribution of ages (18-80), race, and sex. Average vaccination rates prior to the intervention were 9.25-13.60%. The average vaccination rate after the intervention was 91.34%. DISCUSSION: The MSBI quality improvement study identified key areas to address in improving influenza vaccination rates. Vaccine hesitancy, public misinformation, and ambivalence surrounding vaccination with egg allergies or during a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection were all topics addressed during the 2018-2019 intervention year. Additional attention was also put toward provider education and standardization of documentation. Shared decision making and intensive education/outreach efforts are needed by physicians and patients alike to overcome vaccine hesitancy. In comparing this to upcoming COVID-19 vaccine challenges, similar barriers will likely also need to be addressed. Greater research is needed to understand patient motivations regarding hesitancy specific to the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: As evidenced in the yearly battle with influenza and now the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become essential to identify and implement multi-level strategies to maximize vaccination rates, especially amid a global pandemic. With COVID-19 vaccines reaching emergency approval stages, it is important for healthcare providers to start creating workflows and strategies to address patient inquiries. The influenza vaccination quality improvement project presented here can be used as a guideline for future evaluations of COVID-19 vaccination efforts.

AB  - Given the pertinence and acceleration of the spread of COVID-19, there is an increased need for the replicability of data models to verify the veracity of models and visualize important data. Most of these visualizations lack reproducibility, credibility, or accuracy, and are static, which makes it difficult to analyze the spread over time. Furthermore, most current visualizations depicting the spread of COVID-19 are at a global or country level, meaning there is a dearth of regional analysis within a country. Keeping these issues in mind, a replicable, efficient, and simple method to generate regional COVID-19 visualizations mapped with time was created by using the KNIME software, an open-source data analytics platform that can create user-friendly applications or workflows. For this analysis, Albania, Sweden, Ukraine, Denmark, Russia, India, and Australia were closely observed. Among the maps generated for the aforementioned countries, it was noticed that regions with a high population or high population density were often the epicenters within their respective country. The regions caused the virus to spread to their neighboring regions: kickstarting the "domino effect", leading to the infection of another region until the country is overwhelmed with cases-what we call a proximity trend. These dynamic maps are crucial to fighting the pandemic because they can provide insight as to how COVID-19 spreads by providing researchers or officials with an accurate and insightful tool to aid their analysis. By being able to visualize the spread, health and government officials can dive deeper to identify the sources of transmission and attempt to stop or reverse them accordingly.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only distressed medical services but also caused economic upheavals, marking urgent the need for effective therapeutics. The experience of combating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has shown that inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) blocks the replication of the virus. Given the well-studied properties of FDA-approved drugs, identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in an FDA-approved drug library would be of great therapeutic value. Here, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) peptide substrate. Ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate have been found to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibitory activity of these repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro highlights their therapeutic potential for treating COVID-19 and other Betacoronavirus infections.

AB  - The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has paralysed many sectors of human life, including economic, social-cultural and political processes. In the political arena, several countries have postponed elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other countries, including Malawi, went ahead with their planned elections. Malawi held a presidential election at a time when the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing rapidly. In this paper, we assess the effect of the perceived risk of catching COVID-19 on willingness to vote in the Malawi presidential election that was held on 23 June 2020. Turn out in this election was ten percentage points lower than in the general elections that were held a year earlier. The paper draws on a nationally representative survey of adult Malawians (n = 1155). In our main analysis, we use instrumental variables to account for potential endogeneity. We find that nearly two thirds of Malawians thought that they were likely to catch COVID-19 at some point. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 risk, 86% of the country's citizens were willing to vote. Our analysis shows that an individual's perceived risk of catching COVID-19 is associated with a lower likelihood of voting (β = - 0.096; p < 0.05). This suggests that voter turnout in Malawi's fresh presidential election may have been highly affected by the perceived risk of catching COVID-19. The policy implication is that instituting and enforcing primary preventive measures may help reduce the perceived risk of catching COVID-19 and mitigate voter apathy.

AB  - In the last decades, evidence suggesting the direct or indirect involvement of B cells on multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis has accumulated. The increased amount of data on the efficacy and safety of B-cell-depleting therapies from several studies has suggested the addition of these drugs as treatment options to the current armamentarium of disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS. Particularly, rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20 positive B lymphocytes resulting in cell-mediated apoptosis, has been demonstrated to reduce inflammatory activity, incidence of relapses and new brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Additional evidence also demonstrated that patients with progressive MS (PMS) may benefit from RTX, which also showed to be well tolerated, with acceptable safety risks and favorable cost-effectiveness profile.Despite these encouraging results, RTX is currently approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, several forms of vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis, while it can only be administered off-label for MS treatment. Between Northern European countries exist different rules for using not licensed drug for treating MS. The Sweden MS register reports a high rate (53.5%) of off-label RTX prescriptions in relation to other annually started DMTs to treat MS patients, while Danish and Norwegian neurologists have to use other anti-CD20 drugs, as ocrelizumab, in most of the cases.In this paper, we review the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, safety profile and cost effectiveness aspects of RTX for the treatment of MS. Particularly, with the approval of new anti-CD20 DMTs, the recent worldwide COVID-19 emergency and the possible increased risk of infection with this class of drugs, this review sheds light on the use of RTX as an alternative treatment option for MS management, while commenting the gaps of knowledge regarding this drug.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already resulted in a huge setback to mankind in terms of millions of deaths, while the unavailability of an appropriate therapeutic strategy has made the scenario much more severe. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study hopes to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7, respectively, and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is the maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and these could serve as useful targets for the conception of a therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.

AB  - Age is a major risk factor for severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscape of the aging human lung. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, we identify several factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is transcriptionally characterized by increased cell adhesion and stress responses, with reduced mitochondria and cellular replication. Deconvolution analysis reveals that the proportions of alveolar type 2 cells, proliferating basal cells, goblet cells, and proliferating natural killer/T cells decrease with age, whereas alveolar fibroblasts, pericytes, airway smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and IGSF21+ dendritic cells increase with age. Several age-associated genes directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Age-associated genes are also dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in patients with severe COVID-19. These analyses illuminate avenues for further studies on the relationship between age and COVID-19.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified from China in December 2019 and spread rapidly through human-to-human transmission, affecting so many people worldwide. Until now, there has been no specific treatment against the disease and repurposing of the drug. Our investigation aimed to screen potential inhibitors against coronavirus for the repurposing of drugs. Our study analyzed sequence comparison among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV to determine the identity matrix using discovery studio. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was targeted to generate an E-pharmacophore hypothesis to screen drugs from the DrugBank database having similar features. Promising drugs were used for docking-based virtual screening at several precisions. Best hits from virtual screening were subjected to MM/GBSA analysis to evaluate binding free energy, followed by the analysis of binding interactions. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulation approaches were carried out to assess the docked complex's conformational stability. A total of 33 drug classes were found from virtual screening based on their docking scores. Among them, seven potential drugs with several anticancer, antibiotic, and immunometabolic categories were screened and showed promising MM/GBSA scores. During interaction analysis, these drugs exhibited different types of hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residue. Besides, 17 experimental drugs selected from virtual screening might be crucial for drug discovery against COVID-19. The RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and MM/PBSA descriptors from molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the complex's firm nature. Seven promising drugs for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), namely sapanisertib, ornidazole, napabucasin, lenalidomide, daniquidone, indoximod, and salicylamide, could be vital for the treatment of COVID-19. However, extensive in vivo and in vitro studies are required to evaluate the mentioned drug's activity.

AB  - Initial COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom (23rd March-12th May 2020) prompted lifestyle changes for many people. We explored the impact of this lockdown phase on pet dogs using an online survey completed by 6004 dog owners, who provided information including dog management data for the 7 days prior to survey completion (4th-12th May 2020), and for February 2020 (pre-lockdown). We explored associations between potential predictors and four outcomes relating to changes pre-/during lockdown (reduction in number and duration of walks; increased frequency of play/training, and provision of toys). Most owners (79.5%) reported their dog's routine had changed compared to pre-lockdown. There was a four-fold increase in the proportion not left alone for >5 min on any day during a weekly period (14.6% pre-lockdown, 58.0% during lockdown), with the proportion being left for ≥3 h at a time decreasing from 48.5% to 5.4%. Dogs were walked less often and for less time daily during lockdown, with factors related to the dog, owner, household, and home location associated with changes to walking practices. Many dogs had more play/training sessions and were given toys more frequently during lockdown. Decreased walk duration was associated with increased odds of play/training opportunities and toy provision. These changes to dog management have the potential for immediate and longer-term welfare problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults might be less information-seeking in comparison to younger adults. Yet, when a crisis hits, rather than relying on only a few information sources, it is important for people to gather information from a variety of different sources. With more information sources, people are more likely to obtain a more realistic perception of the situation and engagement of health behaviors. This study examined the association between age and information-seeking patterns, and how information-seeking patterns influenced worry about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and protective measures taken during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted from March to May 2020. Ninety younger adults and 105 older adults were recruited in a 21-day daily diary study. Participants reported the types of sources where they received COVID-19-related information, worry from these information sources and protective health behaviors performed each day. Multilevel serial mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Concurrent and time-lagged analyses both revealed that older adults received information from more sources, and more frequently from traditional (e.g., newspaper and TV) and interpersonal sources (e.g., information shared by friends and families), than did younger adults. When receiving information from more sources, older adults were more worried about COVID-19 and performed more protective health behaviors. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrated the utility of having more information sources in the context of a public health crisis and offered suggestions for future public communication and community engagement.

AB  - Understanding the factors that contribute to efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells may provide insights on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and pathogenesis, and reveal targets of intervention. Here, we analyze host and viral determinants essential for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection in both human lung epithelial cells and ex vivo human lung tissues. We identify heparan sulfate as an important attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we show that sialic acids present on ACE2 prevent efficient spike/ACE2-interaction. While SARS-CoV infection is substantially limited by the sialic acid-mediated restriction in both human lung epithelial cells and ex vivo human lung tissues, infection by SARS-CoV-2 is limited to a lesser extent. We further demonstrate that the furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike is required for efficient virus replication in human lung but not intestinal tissues. These findings provide insights on the efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lungs.

We need to urgently find solutions to halt this vicious circle. Where do we begin? Our patients - who are often our best teachers. In my clinical practice, I have observed disparate responses among my patients in response to the pandemic. This highlighted the importance of understanding the factors underlying motivation and provided important clues on what clinicians can do to help our patients create a virtuous circle towards positive health outcomes.

AB  - The new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) emerged in 2019 and hence is often referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This disease causes hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is considered as the cause of a global pandemic. Very limited reports in addition to ex vivo model systems are available to understand the mechanism of action of this virus, which can be used for testing of any drug efficacy against virus infectivity. COVID-19 induces tissue stem cell loss, resulting inhibition of epithelial repair followed by inflammatory fibrotic consequences. Development of clinically relevant models is important to examine the impact of the COVID-19 virus in tissue stem cells among different organs. In this review, we discuss ex vivo experimental models available to study the effect of COVID-19 on tissue stem cells.

AB  - In the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, the need to use preventive-curative treatments is compelling. A series of non-pharmacological compounds, including supplements (oligoelements and vitamins), probiotics, and nutraceuticals, might affect the risk of COVID-19 or reducing clinical severity. Non-pharmacological remedies are easily available and usually have no relevant side effects. There is evidence that bacterial and molecular substances may potentiate the immune system against respiratory viruses. Moreover, these compounds might exert essential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity in COVID-19. Furthermore, nasal lavage may be an additional resource for reducing the viral load and restore the integrity of respiratory patency. Therefore, preventive courses using non-pharmacological remedies could be prescribed to reinforce the immune response and adequate treatment of upper respiratory infection with natural compounds could be considered a reasonable way to manage people in the pandemic COVID-19 era.

AB  - The United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases and deaths. The government's poorly coordinated response has lacked national mandates, failed to deploy adequate personal protective equipment, supplies and testing and devalued advice of science experts. COVID-19 exposed racial disparities in health care and as protests against racial injustice erupted, nurses have responded to the call to confront racism as a public health crisis. Nurses also suffer from lack of personal protective equipment, burnout, extreme workloads, overwhelming deaths and fear of contracting COVID-19. While facing danger, nurses have implemented practice changes and fostered new roles and teamwork to provide safer care. Advancing policy to provide personal protective equipment as well as financial and mental health support for nurses is a priority nationally and globally.

AB  - Objective: This is a rapid systematic review concerning taste alterations in 27,687 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, published in the worldwide literature. Material and methods: Of the 485 articles recovered, 67 eligible studies (27,687 confirmed COVID-19 cases) were included in this analysis. We analysed the prevalence of the taste alterations in patients considering the country of origin of the studies. Results: The results show strong important differences in the overall reported prevalence of taste alterations among the different countries (from 11% of Korea to 88.8% of Belgium). Conclusions: These data highlight that there is a different geographical distribution of taste alterations in COVID-19 patients. Gustatory dysfunction seems to be an understudied symptom of COVID-19 and this may explain the inconsistencies of diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 case definition. Furthermore, this diagnostic underestimation can lead to an increased risk of contagion for the whole population and for the working classes most at risk, including the dental one.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Apart from major health concerns associated to the SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, also the diagnostic workflow encountered serious problems. Limited availability of kit components, buffers and even plastics has resulted in suboptimal testing procedures worldwide. Alternative workflows have been implemented to overcome these difficulties. Recently a liquid based sample prep has been launched as solution to overcome limitations in relation to nucleic acid extraction. OBJECTIVE: Multicenter evaluation of the QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM kit (QIA P&A) for rapid sample preparation and real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to standardized laboratory testing methods. STUDY DESIGN: Selected samples of the routine diagnostic workflow at Clinical Microbiology Laboratories of four Dutch hospitals have been subjected to the rapid QIA P&A protocol and the results have been compared to routine diagnostic data. RESULTS: Combining results of manual and automated procedures, a total of 377 clinical samples of which 202 had been tested positive with a wide range of CT values, showed almost complete concordance in the QIA P&A assay for samples up to CT values of 33 with one exception of CT 31. Prospectively 60 samples were tested and also showed 100 % concordance with 5 positives. The method has been automated by two centres. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an input of only 8 μL of clinical sample, the QIA P&A kit showed good performance for sample preparation and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and can contribute as a rapid molecular testing strategy in managing the CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, now a global health crisis, has surprised health authorities around the world. Recent studies suggest that the measures taken to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak have generated issues throughout the population. Thus, it is necessary to establish and identify the possible risk factors related to the psychosocial and psychophysiological strain during the COVID-19 outbreak. The present extensive literature review assesses the social, psychological, and physiological consequences of COVID-19, reviewing the impact of quarantine measures, isolation, vast human loss, social and financial consequences in the family's economies, and its impact on the psychological health of the population. We also discussed the effect of psychophysiological factors, considering the impact of physical inactivity and modifications in nutritional habits, at psychological and physiological levels. The present review includes an actualized to date bibliography, articles for which were methodologically analyzed to verify they met the standards of quality and scientific accuracy. Authors understand the pandemic as a multifactorial event for which only a profound and extensive analysis would lead to better compression and efficient intervention in the near future.

AB  - Infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies are key in preventing nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. Several commonly used IPC practices are resource-intensive and may be challenging to implement in resource-constrained settings. An international group of healthcare professionals from or with experience in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) searched the literature for relevant evidence. We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for hospital-based IPC practices in resource-constrained settings of LMICs. For cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we suggest that patients be placed in a single isolation room, whenever possible. When single isolation rooms are unavailable or limited, we recommend cohorting patients with COVID-19 on dedicated wards or in dedicated hospitals. We also recommend that cases of suspected COVID-19 be cohorted separately from those with confirmed disease, whenever possible, to minimize the risk of patient-to-patient transmission in settings where confirmatory testing may be limited. We suggest that healthcare workers be designated to care exclusively for patients with COVID-19, whenever possible, as another approach to minimize nosocomial spread. This approach may also be beneficial in conserving limited supplies of reusable personal protective equipment (PPE). We recommend that visitors be restricted for patients with COVID-19. In settings where family members or visitors are necessary for caregiving, we recommend that the appropriate PPE be used by visitors. We also recommend that education regarding hand hygiene and donning/doffing procedures for PPE be provided. Last, we suggest that all visitors be screened for symptoms before visitation and that visitor logs be maintained.

AB  - The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is generating a high number of deaths worldwide. One of the current questions in the field of environmental science is to explain how air pollution can affect the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on public health. The research here focuses on a case study of Italy. Results suggest that the diffusion of COVID-19 in cities with high levels of air pollution is generating higher numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. In particular, results reveal that the number of infected people was higher in cities with more than 100 days per year exceeding limits set for PM10 or ozone, cities located in hinterland zones (i.e. away from the coast), cities having a low average speed of wind and cities with a lower average temperature. In hinterland cities having a high level of air pollution, coupled with low wind speed, the average number of infected people in April 2020-during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic-is more than tripled compared to cities with low levels of air pollution. In addition, results show that more than 75% of infected individuals and about 81% of deaths of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy are in industrialized regions with high levels of air pollution. Although these vital results of the first wave of the COVID-19 from February to August 2020, policymakers have had a low organizational capacity to plan effective policy responses for crisis management to cope with COVID-19 pandemic that is generating recurring waves with again negative effects, deja vu, on public health and of course economic systems.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 entry is mediated by binding of the spike protein (S) to the surface receptor ACE2 and subsequent priming by host TMPRSS2 allowing membrane fusion. Here, we produced extracellular vesicles (EVs) exposing ACE2 and demonstrate that ACE2-EVs are efficient decoys for SARS-CoV-2 S protein-containing lentivirus. Reduction of infectivity positively correlates with the level of ACE2, is much more efficient than with soluble ACE2 and further enhanced by the inclusion of TMPRSS2.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has served as a call-to-arms in preparing practices for the next disaster whether it is another infectious disease or a flood, hurricane, earthquake, a sustained power outage, or something else. A group of predominantly core aesthetic physicians discussed the various aspects of their office procedures that warrant consideration in a proactive approach to the next pandemic/disaster-related event. This guide does not set a standard of practice but contains recommendations that may avoid some of the "lessons learned" with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, the board-certified core aesthetic physicians classified these recommendations into four generalized areas: Practice Management; Supplies and Inventory; Office Staffing Considerations and Protocols; and Patient Management Strategies. Proactive strategies are provided in each of these categories that, if implemented, may alleviate the processes involved with an efficient office closure and reopening process including, in the case of COVID-19, methods to reduce the risk of transmission to doctors, staff, and patients. These strategies also include being prepared for emergency-related notifications of employees and patients; the acquisition of necessary equipment and supplies such as personal protective equipment; and the maintenance and accessibility of essential data and contact information for patients, vendors, financial advisors, and other pertinent entities.J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(1):10-16. doi:10.36849/JDD.2021.5803.

AB  - In an era of increasing technology and interaction with the patient bedside, we explore the role of relocating the bedside from the hospital to the home using telemedicine. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed telemedicine from small and pilot programs to widespread practice at an unprecedented rate. With the rapid implementation of telemedicine, it is important to consider how to create a telehealth system that provides both good care for patients and families while maintaining an excellent education environment for trainees of all levels. To this end, we developed telemedicine educational milestones to describe novel skills required to provide high quality telemedicine care, and allow trainees and clinical educators a metric by which to assess trainee progress. We also created methods and tools to help trainees learn and families feel comfortable in their new role as virtual collaborators. We envision a time when safety does not set the venue; instead the needs of the patient will dictate whether a virtual or in-person visit is the right choice for a family. We expect that pediatric medical genetics and metabolism groups across the country will continue to set a standard of a hybrid care system to meet the unique needs of each individual patient, using telemedicine technology.

AB  - Protection against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related emergent zoonotic coronaviruses is urgently needed. We made homotypic nanoparticles displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 or co-displaying SARS-CoV-2 RBD along with RBDs from animal betacoronaviruses that represent threats to humans (mosaic nanoparticles; 4-8 distinct RBDs). Mice immunized with RBD-nanoparticles, but not soluble antigen, elicited cross-reactive binding and neutralization responses. Mosaic-RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies with superior cross-reactive recognition of heterologous RBDs compared to sera from immunizations with homotypic SARS-CoV-2-RBD-nanoparticles or COVID-19 convalescent human plasmas. Moreover, sera from mosaic-RBD-immunized mice neutralized heterologous pseudotyped coronaviruses equivalently or better after priming than sera from homotypic SARS-CoV-2-RBD-nanoparticle immunizations, demonstrating no immunogenicity loss against particular RBDs resulting from co-display. A single immunization with mosaic-RBD-nanoparticles provides a potential strategy to simultaneously protect against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging zoonotic coronaviruses.

AB  - As the Coronavirus situation (COVID-19) continues to evolve, many questions concerning the factors relating to the diffusion and severity of the disease remain unanswered.Whilst opinions regarding the weight of evidence for these risk factors, and the studies published so far are often inconclusive or offer contrasting results, the role of comorbidities in the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients affected with COVID-19 appears to be evident since the outset. Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are under discussion as important factors affecting the severity of disease. Air pollution has been considered to play a role in the diffusion of the virus, in the propagation of the contagion, in the severity of symptoms, and in the poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that environmental particulate matter (PM) can trigger inflammatory responses at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, sustaining respiratory, cardiovascular, and dysmetabolic diseases.To better understand the intricate relationships among pre-existing conditions, PM, and viral infection, we examined the response at the molecular level of T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells exposed to different fractions of PM. T47D cells express several receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and ACE2, the main - but not the only - receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.PM samples were collected in an urban background site located in the Northern area of the City of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) during winter 2013. T47D cells were exposed to organic or aqueous (inorganic) extracts at the final concentration of 8 m3 for a 4-hour duration. Both the concentration and the exposure time were chosen to resemble an average outdoor exposure. RNA was extracted from cells, purified and hybridised on 66k microarray slides from Agilent.The lists of differentially expressed genes in PM organic extracts were evaluated by using Metacore, and an enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways maps, process networks, and disease by biomarkers altered after T47D treatment.The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in dysmetabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and hypertension through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) canonical pathway.On the basis of current knowledge, existing data, and exploratory experimental evidence, we tease out the likely molecular interplay that can ultimately tip the disease outcome into severity. Looking beyond ACE2, several additional key markers are identified. Disruption of these targets worsens pre-existing conditions and/or exacerbates the adverse effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst appropriately designed, epidemiological studies are very much needed to investigate these associations based on our hypothesis of investigation, by reviewing recent experimental and epidemiological evidence, here we speculate and provide new insights on the possible role of environmental pollution in the exacerbation of effects by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. This work is intended to assist in the development of appropriate investigative approaches to protect public health.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, researchers from all disciplines are coming together and contributing their expertise. CORD-19, a dataset of COVID-19 and coronavirus publications, has been made available alongside calls to help mine the information it contains and to create tools to search it more effectively. We analyse the delineation of the publications included in CORD-19 from a scientometric perspective. Based on a comparison to the Web of Science database, we find that CORD-19 provides an almost complete coverage of research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses. CORD-19 contains not only research that deals directly with COVID-19 and coronaviruses, but also research on viruses in general. Publications from CORD-19 focus mostly on a few well-defined research areas, in particular: coronaviruses (primarily SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2); public health and viral epidemics; molecular biology of viruses; influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; clinical medicine. CORD-19 publications that appeared in 2020, especially editorials and letters, are disproportionately popular on social media. While we fully endorse the CORD-19 initiative, it is important to be aware that CORD-19 extends beyond research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses.

AB  - Previously it has been demonstrated that telehealth (TH) could help cover the gaps in health attention in remote locations. Today the expanded capabilities have transformed TH delivery, and from the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, it has remained one of our biggest allies. Telehealth has become a central piece in patient healthcare delivery during COVID-19 pandemic era. Telehealth allows health care services to reach patients in their homes, keeping other patients safe through social distancing and maintaining self-quarantine. Within this administration of health, TH allows health care providers to focus more resources to pandemic usage and at the same time continue caring for the health of non COVID-19 patients. During this time, clinicians are expanding knowledge about TH capabilities, such as application of forward triage as a tool to avoid patient contact in emergency departments. While previously TH was mainly used for primary care needs, specialized and urgent care health is now being utilized more than ever before. These advantages comes with limitations, some of them include a limited physical exam, lack of access to diagnostic testing or imaging, and many other pitfalls and persistent unmet needs. The 2020 pandemic has led to significant improvements leading into the next generation of telemedicine.

AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) can have harmful effects on human health and can act as a precursor for the formation of other air pollutants in urban environment such as secondary PM2.5 and ozone. The lockdown measures for CoViD-19 allowed to simulate on a large scale the massive and prolonged reduction of road traffic (the main source for NO2 in urban environment). This work aims to selectively assess the maximum impact that total traffic blocking measures can have on NO2. For this reason, three megacities (London, Milan and Paris) were chosen which had similar characteristics in terms of climatic conditions, population, policies of urban traffic management and lockdown measures. 52 air quality control units have been used to compare data measured in lockdown and in the same periods of previous years, highlighting a significant decrease in NO2 concentration due to traffic (London: 71.1 % - 80.8 %; Milan: 8.6 % - 42.4 %; Paris: 65.7 % - 79.8 %). In 2020 the contribution of traffic in London, Milan and Paris dropped to 3.3 ± 1.3 μg m-3, 6.1 ± 0.8 μg m-3, and 13.4 ± 1.5 μg m-3, respectively. Despite the significant reduction in the NO2 concentration, in UT stations average NO2 concentrations higher than 40 μg m-3 were registered for several days. In order to reduce the pollution, the limitation of road traffic could be not enough, but a vision also aimed at rethink the vehicles and their polluting effects should be developed.

AB  - COVID has stirred up an information deluge that challenges our capacity to absorb and make sense of data. In this unrelenting flow of information, Africa has been largely off the radar, escaping the attention of the scientific literature and the media. International agencies have been the exception: despite the still low numbers of cases and deaths, they have voiced concerns, often in catastrophic terms, on the health, economic and social impacts of COVID in African countries. These concerns contrast sharply with the optimistic view that Africa may be spared the worst consequences of the pandemic.This paper provides a snapshot of a crisis in evolution: its features could change as new data become available and our understanding improves. The paper examines the epidemic trends, the health impact, the containment measures and their possible side effects. Africa has a long experience of responding to epidemics: relevant lessons learned are outlined. The picture of the epidemic and its narrative are heterogenous, given the differing vulnerabilities of African countries and the diverse contexts within their borders. The paper, therefore, singles out selected countries as illustrative of specific situations and advocates for a transnational and subnational approach to future analyses.The virus has shown a strong capacity to adapt; therefore, a response strategy, in order to be effective, needs to be flexible and able to adapt to changes. The paper concludes with the recommendation that affected communities should be engaged in the response, to maintain or build trust. A lesson from the Ebola outbreak of a few years ago was that epidemiologists and community leaders learned, after initial difficulties, how to dialogue and work together.A summary update of the pandemic has been added, in view of its fast evolution.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 has not only led to many deaths but also to social and economic downturn globally. The study represents an exhaustive compilation of relevant macroeconomic data regarding the status of the agri-food sector from a demand side perspective and an overview of the food product producer and consumer prices after the shock. Its main purpose is to assess the resilience level of the agri-food sector to the coronavirus pandemic, analyzing its effect on commodity prices and focusing on the supply and value chain. The results highlight that fresh and perishable products, whose production or harvest took place during the first wave of COVID-19, have suffered price level effects, while storable products have not registered significant impacts. This phenomenon is mainly due to the vulnerability of the harvest and production phases, which affected fresh and perishable products supply, and to the resilience of transports and logistics, which instead ensured the supply of storable products to the final consumer. Especially in case of future pandemic waves, the implications and information deriving from the present analysis could support researchers, policy makers and managers, serving as an assessment tool to build suitable strategies for the whole agri-food supply chain and thus ensure sector resilience during these unprecedented times.

AB  - Without a cure, vaccine, or proven long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) strategies present a promising tool to contain its spread. For any TTI strategy, however, mitigation is challenged by pre- and asymptomatic transmission, TTI-avoiders, and undetected spreaders, which strongly contribute to "hidden" infection chains. Here, we study a semi-analytical model and identify two tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spread: (1) the behavior-driven reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the hidden chains becomes too large to be compensated by the TTI capabilities, and (2) the number of new infections exceeds the tracing capacity. Both trigger a self-accelerating spread. We investigate how these tipping points depend on challenges like limited cooperation, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation. Our results suggest that TTI alone is insufficient to contain an otherwise unhindered spread of SARS-CoV-2, implying that complementary measures like social distancing and improved hygiene remain necessary.

AB  - The use of ultrasound guidance for the placement of difficult IVs, arterial lines, and central venous access has become the standard of care. While imaging quality has improved over the last two decades, the lack of affordability, availability, and training have been major limitations in its routine clinical use. We detail the first reported use of biplane imaging using a portable ultrasound probe for difficult vascular access to increase first past success, efficiency, safety, and sterility during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

When comparing responses to questionnaires administered when social distancing and quarantine guidelines were first implemented, we found that PLWH were more likely to have restricted access to medical care, increased financial stress, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, and increased substance use compared to demographically-similar people without HIV.

AB  - COVID-19 has already killed more than one million people around the world. The pandemic had a profound impact on the emotional, social and spiritual life of the public. Due to self-isolation, prohibition of mass-gatherings and quarantine protocols, hospitals and healthcare facilities are closed to visitors. Clergy members are unable to be physically present with sick in their final moments. Many families cannot say goodbye to their loved ones, many people cannot attend funeral rites and many people cannot perform their final mourning rituals. These complicated situations have not only distressed some family members but also someone who is close to death. In this time of crisis, it is important to implore the global community to reflect on the unique and unusual process of grieving. This paper is a response to the recent correspondence published in this journal where the author noted the changing landscapes of death and burial practices in the context of COVID-19. This paper further adds to the emerging and complicated process of death, dying and grief and ways of coping with loss in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The recent Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has led to growing research on the relationship between thromboembolism and Sars-Cov-2 infection. Nowadays, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, coagulation, and inflammatory host immune response are the subject of extensive researches in patients with COVID-19 disease. However, studies on the link between microorganisms or infections and thrombotic or thromboembolic events met fluctuating interest in the past. We, therefore, aimed to briefly summarize previous evidence on this topic, highlighting common points between previous data and what experienced today with SARS-COV2 infections.

AB  - CONTEXT: The literature agrees on the impact of post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents of seriously ill children but there is less clarity about the real extent and gender differences of this psychopathological risk. The recent Covid-19 outbreak highlighted new burdens for researchers on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and clear evidence-based knowledge on this issue is timely needed. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we present a synthesis of the updated evidence on PTSD rates in parents of children with severe diseases. We also aim to try to understand if research in this field has been refined over time with the long-term intent to better face the new challenges of Covid-19 in the paediatric field. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed database was searched. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they assessed PTSD in parents of children diagnosed with physical illnesses. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 240 studies, 4 were included. RESULTS: Analysis of the 4 studies revealed 2 studies with PTSD rates around 20% and in line with previous best-evidence. All 4 studies tried to provide more data on fathers, however, all the studies present the lack of a control group. LIMITATIONS: The limited number of studies, which also differ widely in the methodology used. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological errors evidenced in all the 4 studies limit their reliability, making the understanding of the paediatric caregiver's concern regarding PTSD still difficult. More sound research is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the association between frailty and COVID-19 in relation to mortality in hospitalised patients. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the grey literature were searched for papers from inception to 10th September 2020; the search was re-run in Medline up until the 9th December 2020. Screening, data extraction and quality grading were undertaken by two reviewers. Results were summarised using descriptive statistics, including a meta-analysis of overall mortality; the relationships between frailty and COVID-19 mortality were summarised narratively. RESULTS: 2,286 papers were screened resulting in 26 being included in the review. Most studies were from Europe, half from the UK, and one from Brazil; the median sample size was 242.5, median age 73.1 and 43.5% were female. 22/26 used the Clinical Frailty Scale; reported mortality ranged from 14 to 65%. Most, but not all studies showed an association between increasing frailty and a greater risk of dying. Two studies indicated a sub-additive relationship between frailty, COVID-19 and death, and two studies showed no association. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the majority of studies have shown a positive association between COVID-19 related death and increasing frailty, some studies suggested a more nuanced understanding of frailty and outcomes in COVID-19 is needed. Clinicians should exert caution in placing too much emphasis on the influence of frailty alone when discussing likely prognosis in older people with COVID-19 illness.

AB  - The irradiation of non-malignant diseases, essentially for anti-inflammatory purpose, have been largely proposed and performed worldwide until the 1970-80s. At that time, the better assessment of the radio-induced malignancies, essentially in children and young patients, as well as the efficacy of the new anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and non-steroids), led to the almost disappearance of those techniques, at least in France. In contrast, our German colleagues are still going on treating about 50,000 patients per year for non-malignant (more or less severe) diseases. After a short historical overview, the present article suggests that we were possibly going too far in the rejection of those low-dose irradiations for benign lesions. The recent emergence of new preclinical data, the better understanding of the risk of radio-induced secondary tumours (almost nil in the elderly), and the severity of some situations, such as the cytokine storm of the COVID-19, should probably lead us to reconsider those low - and sometimes very low (less than 1Gy) - irradiations for well-selected indications in the elderly.

AB  - Seasonality of respiratory diseases has been linked, among other factors, to low outdoor absolute humidity and low relative humidity in indoor environments, which increase evaporation of water in the mucosal layer lining the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Facemasks are the most widely used tool for mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Decreased disease severity by the wearer has also been linked to the use of cloth facemasks. This well-documented finding is surprising considering that such masks are poor at filtering the smallest aerosol particles, which can reach the lower respiratory tract and have been associated with severe disease. We show that facemasks strongly increase the effective humidity of inhaled air, thereby promoting hydration of the respiratory epithelium which is known to be beneficial to the immune system. Increased humidity of inspired air could be an alternate explanation for the now well-established link between mask wearing and lower disease severity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unparalleled societal disruption with wide ranging effects on individual liberties, the economy, and physical and mental health. While no social strata or population has been spared, the pandemic has posed unique and poorly characterized challenges for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the pandemic's broad effects, it is helpful to organize the risks posed to specific populations using theoretical models. These models can guide scientific inquiry, interventions, and public policy. Models also provide a visual image of the interplay of individual-, network-, community-, structural-, and pandemic-level factors that can lead to increased risks of infection and associated morbidity and mortality for individuals and populations. Such models are not unidirectional, in that actions of individuals, networks, communities and structural changes can also affect overall disease incidence and prevalence. In this commentary, we describe how the social ecological model (SEM) may be applied to describe the theoretical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). This model can provide a necessary framework to systematically guide time-sensitive research and implementation of individual-, community-, and policy-level interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with OUD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to spotlight specific methods for people working from home to apply restorative environment research to improve productivity and mental health during shelter-in-place. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sheltering-in-place and telework. While necessary, these strategies may lead to negative consequences such as social isolation and worse performance. However, nature environments have been shown to have a variety of positive effects in several different settings, including improved attention, positive affect, and increased job satisfaction, and these may be translated to the home workspace setting. METHOD: This provides a narrative review of the environmental psychology literature, describing articles involving nature in a task performance or stress context and how it has been applied. It then moves on to discuss how these findings could possibly be applied in the context of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Although beneficial results are mixed, the review found a variety of relatively simple and cost-effective methods that could assist workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including taking a break in nature and implementing nature in the workspace. APPLICATION: The application of restorative environment research could be an efficient way of mitigating the negative psychological effects due to at-home sheltering and telework in order to combat COVID-19.

Currently, scientists and researchers are intensively working to develop antimicrobial, antiviral coating solutions that would efficiently impede/stop the contagion of COVID-19 via surface contamination. Herein we present a flavonoid-based antimicrobial surface coating fabricated by laser processing that has the potential to eradicate COVID-19 contact transmission. Quercetin-containing coatings showed better resistance to microbial colonization than antibiotic-containing ones.

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some authors have advocated a program of controlled voluntary infection (CVI) with SARS-CoV-2. Under CVI, during periods where the medical system is under capacity, volunteers from low-risk groups would be intentionally infected after giving informed consent, and then quarantined until they have developed immunity. Proponents claim that this could have benefits for society, such as building herd immunity and ensuring that critical workers won't be incapacitated during the peak of the infection. They also claim that this could have benefits for individuals, such as being safely exempted from lockdown measures and (for individuals who are likely to be infected anyway) ensuring that the infection happens under relatively less dangerous conditions. Some respond that CVI would unethical. Here, I argue that, while CVI may or may not be ill-advised for empirical reasons, there are no in-principle ethical objections to it (i.e., if CVI would work as well as its proponents think, it would be ethical to implement it). I present three arguments for this conclusion. The first is an argument from informed consent: informed consent to relevantly similar medical procedures renders performing these procedures permissible, so informed consent to CVI would render it permissible. The second is an argument from reasonable beneficence: it draws on recent work by Caspar Hare on relevantly similar choices to argue that CVI is permissible. The third is an argument from precedent: smallpox variolation was permissible, and CVI is relevantly similar to that, so CVI is permissible.

AB  - We analyze the transmission routes, possible viral reservoirs in the oral cavity and considerations about dental care of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. We also analyze the protocols required before and after a dental procedure, aiming to increase the awareness of dentists about the importance of virus spread prevention among health care workers and patients. The evaluation of symptoms associated with SARS- CoV-2 such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and the inquiry about possible contacts with infected people is of utmost importance. The tongue and oral mucosa are important viral reservoirs and the transmission of the virus occurs primarily by saliva droplets. Therefore, elective dental care should be postponed, attending only dental emergencies during this period, incorporating the use of protective personal equipment (PPE) and using manual instruments to prevent the production of aerosols.

AB  - The aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review on psychological behavior in the context of pandemic scenarios during the twenty-first century. We focused on empirical works and brief case reports of H1N1 flu and COVID-19. Our review included 32 papers published both in English or Spanish. We built a set of tables that allowed us to classify the information in four main categories, namely the psychological impact of the pandemic, whether people follow or not official measures to protect themselves against the pandemic, psychological adherence considerations implied as mediators to respect official strategies, and relevant methodological characteristics of the pandemic research. Results show that there are significant impacts on the psychological behavior of people, social groups and organizations in several dimensions, namely emotion, cognition, behavior, mental health, organization and psychosocial factors. In addition, we found that certain social groups experienced a critical psychosocial impact likely due to the pandemic. Psychosocial factors affecting adherence were also identified, which allow us to better understand how health strategies are followed by the population. Different psychosocial suggestions, which emerged from the papers reviewed, were systematized and should be considered as possible pandemic strategies to be implemented.

AB  - With the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, the public keeps getting epidemic-related information on the media. News reports on the increasing number of fatalities have exposed individuals to death, which causes negative emotional experiences such as tension, anxiety, and fear. This study aimed to investigate whether creativity could serve as an anxiety-buffer when mortality is salient. Based on previous findings, the present study utilized type of creative task and personal search for meaning as moderators. In Study 1, a 2 (mortality salience: absent, present) × 2 (type of creative task: benevolent, malevolent) between-subject design was utilized, and 168 subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. In Study 2, 221 subjects were recruited. The experimental procedure was similar to Study 1, except that the priming paradigm of mortality was changed and search for meaning was included as an additional moderating variable. State anxiety was measured as the dependent variable in both studies. Results of Study 1 showed that, while the benevolent creative task could buffer anxiety in the mortality salience condition, the malevolent creative task did not have the same effect. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between mortality salience, type of creative task, and search for meaning in life on anxiety. In Study 2, the buffering function of benevolent creativity was more intense for participants with a higher level of search for meaning. Together, these findings reveal the influence of different types of creative tasks on individual anxiety levels under death priming conditions and the moderating effect of search for meaning in this relationship. Further, they suggest the need to focus on the role of creativity in terror management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease with a high fatality rate. Up to now, there are an estimated 26 million confirmed cases and 865,000 deaths around the world. But no effective way can control this disease. As the country that first discovered and treated the COVID-19, China has formed relatively mature prevention and treatment methods such as "3 prescriptions and 3 drugs." Xuan Fei Bai Du Fang, as a member of "3 prescriptions and 3 drugs," has very good clinical effects. METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were searched for randomized controlled studies published to date. This study only screens clinical randomized controlled trials on QFBDF for COVID-19 to evaluate its efficacy and safety.Import all literatures that meet the requirements into Endnote X9 software. The information was finally cross-checked by 2 reviewers. Papers selected for review were assessed for risk of bias according to the criteria. Quality assessment on design of study, risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision were assessed using the GRADE framework. Where sufficient studies were available, publication bias was assessed visually using funnel plots. Relative risks for primary and secondary outcomes were calculated on an intent-to-treat basis and pooled using random effects meta-analysis. the continuous is expressed by mean difference or standard mean difference, eventually the data is synthesized using a fixed effect model or a random effect model depending on whether or not heterogeneity exists. The heterogeneity of studies will be evaluated by Q-test and I2 statistic with RevMan5.3. RESULTS: The time from a positive diagnosis to a negative result of 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests (not on the same day), cure rate. The results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide new evidence for the effectiveness and safety of Xuan Fei Bai Du Fang in the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The transition metal Cu is an essential micronutrient that serves as a co-factor for numerous enzymes involved in redox and oxygen chemistry. However, Cu is also a potentially toxic metal, especially to unicellular microbes that are in direct contact with their environment. Since 400 BCE, Cu toxicity has been leveraged for its antimicrobial properties and even today, Cu based materials are being explored as effective antimicrobials against human pathogens spanning bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. Given that Cu has the double-edged property of being both highly toxic and an essential micronutrient, it plays an active and complicated role at the host-pathogen interface. Humans have evolved methods of incorporating Cu into innate and adaptive immune processes and both sides of the penny (Cu toxicity and Cu as a nutrient) are employed. Here we review the evolution of Cu in biology and its multi-faceted roles in infectious disease, from the viewpoints of the microbial pathogens as well as the animal hosts they infect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Through a combination of strong routine immunization (RI), strategic supplemental immunization activities (SIA) and robust surveillance, numerous countries have been able to approach or achieve measles elimination. The fragility of these achievements has been shown, however, by the resurgence of measles since 2016. We describe trends in routine measles vaccine coverage at national and district level, SIA performance and demographic changes in the three regions with the highest measles burden. FINDINGS: WHO-UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage show that global coverage of the first dose of measles vaccine has stabilized at 85% from 2015 to 19. In 2000, 17 countries in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions had measles vaccine coverage below 50%, and although all increased coverage by 2019, at a median of 60%, it remained far below levels needed for elimination. Geospatial estimates show many low coverage districts across Africa and much of the Eastern Mediterranean and southeast Asian regions. A large proportion of children unvaccinated for MCV live in conflict-affected areas with remote rural areas and some urban areas also at risk. Countries with low RI coverage use SIAs frequently, yet the ideal timing and target age range for SIAs vary within countries, and the impact of SIAs has often been mitigated by delays or disruptions. SIAs have not been sufficient to achieve or sustain measles elimination in the countries with weakest routine systems. Demographic changes also affect measles transmission, and their variation between and within countries should be incorporated into strategic planning. CONCLUSIONS: Rebuilding services after the COVID-19 pandemic provides a need and an opportunity to increase community engagement in planning and monitoring services. A broader suite of interventions is needed beyond SIAs. Improved methods for tracking coverage at the individual and community level are needed together with enhanced surveillance. Decision-making needs to be decentralized to develop locally-driven, sustainable strategies for measles control and elimination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for safe and effective surface decontamination methods, particularly in healthcare settings. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of peracetic acid (PAA) dry fogging in decontaminating healthcare facility surfaces experimentally contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Nine materials (stainless steel, latex painted wood, unsealed hardwood, melamine countertop, vinyl flooring, clear plastic, faux leather, computer keyboard button, and smartphone touch screen) were surface contaminated with 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 >106, and allowed to dry before exposing to PAA dry fogging. FINDINGS: When fumigated with PAA dry fog for 1 h, no infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered from any of the experimentally inoculated surface types. By contrast, high titres of infectious virus were recovered from corresponding untreated drying controls of the same materials. CONCLUSION: Standard surface decontamination processes, including sprays and wipes, are laborious and frequently cannot completely decontaminate sensitive electronic equipment. The ease of use, low cost, and overall effectiveness of a PAA dry fogging suggest that it should be considered for decontaminating healthcare settings, particularly intensive care units where severely ill SARS-CoV-2 patients are cared for.

AB  - Camelid-derived and synthetic single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are emerging as potent weapons against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. sdAbs are small, compact, thermostable immunoglobulin elements capable of binding targets with subnanomolar affinities. By leveraging the power of phage- and yeast surface-display technologies, rare sdAbs can be isolated from highly diverse and complex antibody libraries. Once in hand, sdAbs can be engineered to improve binding affinity, avidity, target specificities, and biodistribution. In this Opinion piece we highlight a series of sophisticated studies describing the identification of ultrapotent sdAbs directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. We discuss the possible applications of these antibodies in the global fight against COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Retrospective, observational, single-center, cohort study investigating the safety profile of biological therapy in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Retrospective, observational, cohort study of pediatric patients with IBD, receiving infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab for at least 2 months. Data related to the immediate and delayed adverse events (AEs) were collected, focusing on the reaction type and severity, the time of onset, the outcome and the temporary or definitive therapy discontinuation secondary to the AE. Number of suspected and confirmed coronavirus disease-209 (COVID-19) cases and their outcomes, as well as flu vaccination coverage were collected. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five children were included (101 [55%] CD, 82 [44%] UC, and 2 [1%] IBDU): 149 received infliximab (IFX) (81%), 88 (48%) adalimumab (ADA), 18 (21%) vedolizumab, and 4 (2%) ustekinumab. The overall AE rates were 49%, 67% of whom likely medication-related. Eleven (6%) patients experienced more than 1 AE, 18 patients (10%) presented an immediate reaction, and 82 (45%) a delayed AE. Among the 90 patients experiencing at least 1 AE, 97% had mild-to-moderate AEs. Only 4 SAEs were reported (4%). Treatment discontinuation because of AE occurred in 25 patients (14%). Four COVID-19 cases were reported, all with a mild course. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm a good safety profile of biologics. Infusion reactions to IFX administration remain one of the main issues, significantly linked to its immunogenicity and consequently with an impact on its efficacy and durability.

AB  - Prevention of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in healthcare workers (HCWs) facing the current COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge worldwide as HCWs are likely to experience acute and chronic, often unpredictable, occupational stressors leading to PTSS. This review aims to analyze the literature to discover which topics have been focused on and what the latest developments are in managing the occupational risk of PTSS in HCWs during the current pandemic. For the purpose of this review, we searched for publications in MEDLINE/Pubmed using selected keywords. The articles were reviewed and categorized into one or more of the following categories based on their subject matter: risk assessment, risk management, occurrence rates. A total of 16 publications matched our inclusion criteria. The topics discussed were: "Risk Assessment", "Occurrence Rates", and "Risk Management". Young age, low work experience, female gender, heavy workload, working in unsafe settings, and lack of training and social support were found to be predictors of PTSS. This review's findings showed the need for urgent interventions aimed at protecting HCWs from the psychological impact of traumatic events related to the pandemic and leading to PTSS; healthcare policies need to consider preventive and management strategies toward PTSS, and the related psychic sequelae, in HCWs.

AB  - With the spread of SARS-CoV-2, contingency measures and plans to facilitate the screening of infected patients are needed. Changes in olfaction have been cited as symptoms of the disease, and it is important to prove or exclude its association with this condition to refine the symptomatic criteria for early isolation. This article aims to analyze the association between olfactory disorders and SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as investigate the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The research was carried out using the PubMed, Science Direct, and LILACS databases on May 9, 2020, and updated on May 21. Combinations of MeSH descriptors and the Boolean operator, "AND," were used: coronavirus infections AND olfactory disorders, coronavirus infections, and neurological manifestations. A total of 1187 articles were found in the databases, of which 17 were included in the study. The data suggest that changes in smell are strongly associated with Covid-19, especially in women and patients with fever; these changes increase the degree of suspicion of Covid-19, and they warrant early implementation of isolation and surveillance measures. There are still gaps in the elucidation of the pathways involved in the loss of smell caused by SARS-CoV-2; however, the great affinity of the virus for ACE-2 receptors, which are present in large quantities in the nasal cavity and olfactory bulb, has been considered.

AB  - The article presents a comprehensive and cross-cutting review of key marine waste issues, taking into account: sources, fate, risks, transport pathways, threats, legislation, current challenges, and knowledge gaps. The growing amount of both human-created waste in seas and oceans and waste reaching marine ecosystems from land is one of today's challenges for the global economy and the European Union. It is predicted that if no decisive steps are taken to limit the amount of this type of waste, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the oceans after 2050. The influence of microplastics and nanoplastics on living organisms remains undiagnosed. Within the international and EU law, solutions are being developed to properly manage waste on board ships and to reduce the impact of processes related to the recycling of the vessels on the environment. Currently, over 80% of ships are dismantled in the countries of South Asia, in conditions that threaten the environment and the safety of workers. After World War 2, large quantities of chemical weapons were deposited in the seas. Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water. For many years, radioactive waste had also been dumped into marine ecosystems, although since 1993 there has been a total ban on such disposal of radionuclides. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine waste generation has also been presented as a significant factor influencing marine waste generation and management.

AB  - A systematic review of the incubation period of COVID-19 was compiled and analyzed from 21 quantitative studies. We investigated the incubation period of COVID-19 with regard to age, biological sex, location, and severity of the disease. Based on the data extracted, we report an overall mean and median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.894 days and 5.598 days, respectively. The incubation period did not statistically vary for biological sex or age, but some studies suggest a longer incubation period in the young and elderly. Cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei Province of China may have a shorter incubation period for COVID-19 but the shorter incubation period may be due to an increase in viral load. In studying coronavirus strains such as SARS and MERS, researchers have discovered an inverse relationship between incubation period length and virus severity. Taking into consideration that SARS-CoV-2 is part of the beta-coronavirus family, as well as the study mentioned above, we suggest that people who experience more severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 may have a shorter incubation period.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Review article.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - To confront the global Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the spread of the virus, we need to better understand if face mask use is effective to contain the outbreak and investigate the potential drivers in favor of mask adoption. It is highly questionable since there is no consensus among the general public despite official recommendations. For the first time, we conduct a panel econometric exercise to assess the dynamic impact of face mask use on both infected cases and fatalities on a global scale. We reveal a negative impact of mask wearing on fatality rates and on the Covid-19 number of infected cases. The delay of action varies from around 7 days to 28 days concerning infected cases but is more longer concerning fatalities. We also document the increasing adoption of mask use over time. We find that population density and pollution levels are significant determinants of heterogeneity regarding mask adoption across countries, while altruism, trust in government and demographics are not. Surprisingly, government effectiveness and income level (GDP) have an unexpected influence. However, strict government policies against Covid-19 have the most significant effect on mask use. Therefore, the most effective way of increasing the level of mask wearing is to enforce strict laws on the wearing of masks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:I used public available macro/aggregated (and not individual) data about wearing mask behaviors from Maryland University, Covid-19 outcomes from John Hopkins University (infected cases and fatalities) and publicly macro data for the quality of institutions.

AB  - Facing shortages of personal protective equipment, some clinicians have advocated the use of barrier enclosures (typically mounted over the head, with and without suction) to contain aerosol emissions from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. There is however little evidence for its usefulness. To test the effectiveness of such a device, we built a manikin that can expire micron-sized aerosols at flow rates close to physiological conditions. We then placed the manikin inside the enclosure and used a laser sheet to visualize the aerosol leaking out. We show that with sufficient suction, it is possible to effectively contain aerosol from the manikin even at high flow rates (up to 60 L min−1) of oxygen, reducing aerosol exposure outside the enclosure by 99%. In contrast, a passive barrier without suction only reduces aerosol exposure by 60%.Competing Interest StatementNgee Ann Polytechnic and Ng Teng Fong general Hospital have filed a patent submission for the barrier enclosure design.Funding StatementWe are grateful to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research for providing financial support under A*CRUSE funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRB exemptAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led at times to a scarcity of personal protective equipment, including medical masks, for health care clinicians, especially in primary care settings. The objective of this review was to summarize current evidence regarding the use of cloth masks to prevent respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), among health care clinicians. METHODS: We searched 5 databases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and the reference lists of identified articles on April 3, 2020. All identified publications were independently screened by 2 reviewers. Two authors independently extracted data and graded the studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs) were graded using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, and observational and nonhuman subject studies were graded using 11 domains common across frequently used critical appraisal tools. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: Our search identified 136 original publications. Nine studies met inclusion criteria. We performed a qualitative synthesis of the data from these studies. Four nonrandomized trials, 3 laboratory studies, 1 single-case experiment, and 1 RCT were identified. The laboratory studies found that cloth materials provided measurable levels of particle filtration but were less efficacious at blocking biologic material than medical masks. The RCT found that cloth masks were associated with significantly more viral infections than medical masks. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature suggests that cloth materials are somewhat efficacious in filtering particulate matter and aerosols but provide a worse fit and inferior protection compared to medical masks in clinical environments. The quality and quantity of literature addressing this question are lacking. Cloth masks lack evidence for adequate protection of health care clinicians against respiratory viral infections.

AB  - Medicare's Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing Program, which awards value-based incentive payments based on hospital readmissions, distributed its first two rounds of incentives during fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Incentive payments were based on achievement or improvement scores-whichever was better. Incentive payments were as low as -2.0 percent in both program years and as high as +1.6 percent in FY 2019 and +3.1 percent in FY 2020. In FY 2019, 26 percent of facilities earned positive incentives and 72 percent earned negative incentives, compared with 19 percent positive and 65 percent negative incentives in FY 2020. Larger, rural, and not-for-profit facilities were more likely to earn positive incentives, as were those with the highest registered nurse staffing levels. Although these findings indicate the potential to reward high-quality care at skilled nursing facilities, intended and unintended outcomes of this new value-based purchasing program should be monitored closely for possible program refinements, particularly in light of the disproportionate impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on nursing facilities.

AB  - The current global outbreak of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Considering the gravity of its impact there is an immediate need to develop a detection technique that is sensitive, specific, fast, and affordable for the clinical diagnosis of the disease. Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)-based detection platforms are contemplated to be the gold standard to detect viral RNA. However, that may be susceptible to errors, and there is a risk of obtaining false results, which ultimately compromises the strategy of efficient disease management. Several modern techniques exhibiting assured results with enhanced sensitivity and specificity against the SARS-CoV-2 associated viral components or immune response against it have been developed and may be implemented. The review deals with the conventional RT-PCR detection techniques and compares them to other detection platforms viz., biosensor based detection of antigens, fluorescent or colorimetric detection systems including CRISPR-Cas 13 based SHERLOCK kit, CRISPR Cas-9 based FELUDA test kit, CRISPR DETECTR kit, Next Generation Sequencing or microarray-based kits. These modern techniques are great as a point of care detection methods but should be followed by RT PCR based detection for the confirmation of COVID-19 status.

AB  - The National Blood Transfusion Services under the aegis of the ministry of health and family welfare, India has recently issued guidelines regarding the blood donor selection criteria and the processing of blood. Care has been taken to make the blood transfusions safer. However, COVID-19 has disrupted the organization of the voluntary blood donation drives, whole blood donations [WBD] and restricted the donors' movement to the blood transfusion centres all across the world. While sickness and the need for transfusions are very much in place, the gap of demand against blood collection has widened. Additionally, with the monsoon season at hand, and the categorical challenges of a dengue outbreak, the subsequent need for blood components especially the platelet concentrates is going to rise. Some of the criteria laid for deferring a blood donor from his or her WBD need a categorical revision, considering these unprecedented times. We, therefore, critically analyzed the blood donor selection criteria and hereby, suggest an updating regarding the pre-donation haemoglobin, sexually transmitted diseases, lactation, pregnancy and many such subheadings. We also suggest collecting smaller blood volumes in the blood bags for the optimal benefit of the recipients both for now and also as a measure of pandemic preparedness for future use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 has affected the whole world including Odisha, a state in eastern India. Many people migrated in the state from different countries as well as states during this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The aim of this study was to analyze the RNA binding domain (RBD) sequence of spike protein from the isolates collected from the throat swab samples of COVID-19 positive cases and further to assess the RBD affinity with ACE2 of different species including human. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing for 35 clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates from COVID-19 positive patients was performed using ARTIC amplicon based sequencing. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the Spike and RBD region of all isolates. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor of five different species was also analysed. RESULTS: Spike region of 32 isolates showed one/multiple alterations in nucleotide bases in comparison to the Wuhan reference strain. One of the identified mutation at 1204 (Ref A, RMRC 22 C) in the RBD of spike protein showed a stronger binding affinity with human ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, RBDs of all the Indian isolates showed binding affinity for ACE2 of different species. CONCLUSION: As mutated RBD showed stronger interaction with human ACE2, it could potentially result in higher infectivity. Binding affinity of RBDs for ACE2 of all the five species studied, suggests that the virus can infect a wide variety of animals which could also act as natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social isolation among older adults raises major issues for equity in healthcare in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN TEXT: This commentary describes current challenges in preventing social isolation among older adults and proposes pathways to develop inclusive approaches to intervention in this vulnerable population. Building interventions that take account of structural inequities among older persons, as well as their subjective experiences, expectations and perspectives, appears fundamental to improve their health and quality of life in pandemic and post-pandemic contexts. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that equity-based and person-centered approaches are critical to counter the negative outcomes of social isolation in the vulnerable older population.

AB  - In order to control the widespread COVID-19, the government of India had imposed a nationwide lockdown on all non-essential activities from 22 March to 3 May 2020. Daily ambient PM10 , PM2.5 , NO, NO2 and O3 concentrations in Delhi and Kolkata from 1 March to 3 May period of 2019 and 2020 were collected from different monitoring stations along with meteorological data to study the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on ambient pollutant concentrations. Average ambient concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly decreased (Delhi: 59% and 43% respectively and Kolkata: 49% and 50% respectively) during the lockdown period compared to the same period during 2019 in both cities. Average ambient O3 concentration in Delhi was significantly lower in 2020 (38.5 μg m-3 ) compared to 2019 (44.7 μg m-3 ) during the study period. However, average ambient O3 concentration was significantly higher during 2020 (46.9 μg m-3 ) compared to 2019 (31.4 μg m-3 ) in Kolkata. Effect size analysis of different predictive variables concludes that the lockdown period explains maximum variation in ambient concentrations of PM10 andPM2.5 during 2020 in both cities. However, maximum variation in ambient O3 concentrations in both cities was explained primarily by spatial variation rather than the lockdown period. The study suggests, major policy implementation related to the transport and industrial sectors that aims to address the ambient air pollution problem in India may reduce the ambient particulate matter concentrations, though it may not have a significant effect on other ambient air pollutants such as O3 in major Indian cities.

AB  - The pandemic causing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has globally infected more than 50 million people and ∼1.2 million have succumbed to this deadly pathogen. With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care. In this comprehensive review, we analyze currently adopted advanced technologies and their concurrent use in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

AB  - The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers saliva contact the lead transmission means of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Saliva droplets or aerosols expelled by heavy breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing may carry this virus. People in close distance may be exposed directly or indirectly to these droplets, especially those droplets that fall on surrounding surfaces and people may end up contracting COVID-19 after touching the mucosa tissue on their faces. It is of great interest to quickly and effectively detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in an environment, but the existing methods only work in laboratory settings, to the best of our knowledge. However, it may be possible to detect the presence of saliva in the environment and proceed with prevention measures. However, detecting saliva itself has not been documented in the literature. On the other hand, many sensors that detect different organic components in saliva to monitor a person's health and diagnose different diseases that range from diabetes to dental health have been proposed and they may be used to detect the presence of saliva. This paper surveys sensors that detect organic and inorganic components of human saliva. Humidity sensors are also considered in the detection of saliva because a large portion of saliva is water. Moreover, sensors that detect infectious viruses are also included as they may also be embedded into saliva sensors for a confirmation of the virus' presence. A classification of sensors by their working principle and the substance they detect is presented. This comparison lists their specifications, sample size, and sensitivity. Indications of which sensors are portable and suitable for field application are presented. This paper also discusses future research and challenges that must be resolved to realize practical saliva sensors. Such sensors may help minimize the spread of not only COVID-19 but also other infectious diseases.

AB  - Reliable indoor air disinfection could make clinical and other necessary indoor spaces safer during epidemics with airborne transmission like COVID-19. Low-dose upper-room germicidal ultraviolet-C (GUV 254 nm) is well-suited for this because of the SARS-CoV-2 virus' sensitivity to GUV inactivation and GUV's relatively easy adaptability to many types of indoor spaces without respect to outside weather conditions. However, most existing upper-room GUV fixtures are relatively expensive and inefficient at creating an upper-room disinfection zone due to loss of disinfecting UV-C photons caused by the casing and louvers designed to protect persons in the occupied space. Presented herein are two moderate-size restaurant spaces, 900 ft2 (25.5 m3 ) and 630 ft2 (17.8 m3 ) respectively, in which low-cost bare-bulb GUV fixtures, without exterior casing, were installed with upward-pulling ceiling fans to provide upper-room disinfection and lower-room safety. Proper safety-tested installations like these are adaptable to hospital Emergency Department waiting rooms, clinics, nursing home and prison common areas, public libraries, schools, and restaurants.

AB  - A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding declarations for the CMMID COVID-19 Working Group are as follows.

AB  - Background: The Canadian Immunization Guide (CIG) is a comprehensive resource on immunization for health professionals and vaccine program decision-makers. It is developed based on the evidence-based recommendations of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). The NACI Vaccine Safety Working Group (VSWG) is comprised of NACI members, liaison members and external experts. The World Allergy Organization now recommends that antihistamines should not be used in the initial treatment of anaphylaxis. The update of the chapter was also used to provide further information and clarity to several tables in the chapter. Methods: In updating the CIG anaphylaxis guidance, VSWG conducted an environmental scan, a review of relevant literature and consulted international and Canadian experts and professional societies. Results: The use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride as adjunctive treatment in the management of anaphylaxis in a community setting is no longer recommended. Other notable changes made to the chapter include the following: 1) retitled: "Anaphylaxis and other acute reactions following vaccination"; 2) inclusion of new tables: "Key distinguishing features of anaphylaxis and vasovagal syncope" and "Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis"; and 3) updated tables: "Anaphylaxis management kit: recommended items" and "Dosage of intramuscular EPINEPHrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) solution, by age or weight". Conclusion: The updated CIG chapter provides healthcare providers with further clarity in recognizing and managing anaphylaxis in community settings. The updated intramuscular epinephrine dosage table will aid in optimal epinephrine administration, while the revised guidance against the use of diphenhydramine hydrochloride will prevent its unnecessary stockpiling in preparation for potential mass vaccination clinics related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

AB  - In this brief essay, we combine biological, historical, philosophical and anthropological perspectives to ask anew the question about the nature of the virus. How should we understand Sars-CoV-2 and why does it matter? The argument we present is that the virus undermines any neat distinction between the natural and the human-made, the biological and the social. Rather, to understand the virus and the pandemic we need to understand both as intimately connected to our own social and historical condition. What started as a reflection on the nature of the virus thus turns into a reflection on the human condition as refracted in this pandemic or an anthropology of the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health and social care workers (HSCWs) have carried a heavy burden during the COVID-19 crisis and, in the challenge to control the virus, have directly faced its consequences. Supporting their psychological wellbeing continues, therefore, to be a priority. This rapid review was carried out to establish whether there are any identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst HSCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: We undertook a rapid review of the literature following guidelines by the WHO and the Cochrane Collaboration's recommendations. We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The 24 studies included in this review reported data predominantly from China (18 out of 24 included studies) and most sampled urban hospital staff. Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological well-being in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed. Further research including social care workers and analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.

AB  - Coronaviruses have become of great medical and scientific interest because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The hCoV-HKU1 is an endemic betacoronavirus that causes mild respiratory symptoms, although the infection can progress to severe lung disease and death. During viral replication, a discontinuous transcription of the genome takes place, producing the subgenomic messenger RNAs. The nucleocapsid protein (N) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of this process, acting as an RNA chaperone and participating in the nucleocapsid assembly. The isolated N-terminal domain of protein N (N-NTD) specifically binds to the transcriptional regulatory sequences and control the melting of the double-stranded RNA. Here, we report the resonance assignments of the N-NTD of HKU1-CoV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led caregivers to modify patient healthcare, with a high impact on patients with chronic pain. AIMS: To map recommendations for the management of chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose a workflow for the management of these patients. DESIGN: This was a scoping review. METHODS: The databases searched were PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and LILACS. The studies were examined by two independent reviewers. The disagreements between reviewers were resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer. RESULTS: We presented the results in the form of a table, a workflow, and a narrative summary. The search resulted in 13 studies selected for full reading, including one consensus, five guidance documents, two expert panels, one joint statement, two educational flyers, and two free comments. We considered new technologies, including telemedicine. Each pain service needs to establish a screening model, classifying patients according to corresponding severity. Particular attention should be given to patients who use opioids and are at risk of misusing them. Nonpharmacological approaches and pain education should be maintained, considering the use of telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for the management of chronic pain during COVID-19 include adjustments to the patient care model. The workflow proposes the use of telemedicine, screening for painful intensity, and the use of color-signaled intervention packages according to severity (green, yellow, and red).

AB  - Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for its control is mass testing. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 μL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The methodology described in this study represents a simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems.

AB  - Due to their need for living cells, viruses have developed adaptive evolutionary strategies to survive and perpetuate in reservoir hosts that play a crucial role in the ecology of emerging pathogens. Pathogenic and potentially pandemic betacoronaviruses arose in humans in 2002 (SARS-CoV, disappeared in July 2003), 2012 (MERS-CoV, still circulating in Middle East areas), and 2019 (SARS-CoV-2, causing the current global pandemic). As universally recognized, bats host ancestors of the above-mentioned zoonotic viruses. However, hedgehogs have been recently identified in Europe and Asia as possible reservoirs of MERS-CoV-like strains classified as Erinaceus coronavirus (EriCoV). To elucidate the evolution and genetics of EriCoVs, NGS (next generation sequencing) and Sanger sequencing were used to examine fecal samples collected in Northern Italy in 2018/2019 from 12 hedgehogs previously found EriCoV-positive by RT-PCR. By sequence analysis, eight complete EriCoV genomes, obtained by NGS, showed a high phylogenetic correlation with EriCoV strains previously reported in Eurasia. Interestingly, eight viral strains presented an additional ORF encoding for the CD200 ortholog located between the genes encoding for the Spike and the ORF3a proteins. The CD200 ortholog sequences were closely similar to the host CD200 protein but varying among EriCoVs. The result, confirmed by Sanger sequencing, demonstrates for the first time that CoVs can acquire host genes potentially involved in the immune-modulatory cascade and possibly enabling the virus to escape the host defence.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a global health emergency, the use of multiple types of plastic-based PPEs as a measure to reduce the infection increased tremendously. Recent evidence suggests that the overuse of PPEs during the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening plastic pollution in the marine environment. In this short focus, we discussed the potential sources, fate, and effects of PPE plastic to the marine environment and proposed five key research needs, involving (1) the occurrence and abundance of PPEs, (2) the sources, fate, and drivers of PPEs, (3) PPEs as a source of microplastics, (4) PPEs as a vector of invasive species and pathogens, and (5) PPEs as a source and vector of chemical pollutants in the marine environment. We suggest that addressing these knowledge gaps will lay the groundwork for improved COVID-19-associated waste management and legislation to prevent marine plastic pollution to continue exacerbating.

AB  - Feline coronavirus (FCoV) exists as two different genotypes, FCoV type I and II, each including two biotypes, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the latter being a virulent variant originating from the former virus. Recently, two amino acid substitutions, M1058L and S1060A, within the spike protein have been associated to the FECV/FIPV virulence change. In this study, we have analysed the frequency of detection of such mutations in FIPV and FECV strains circulating in Italian cats and obtained information about their evolutionary relationships with reference isolates. A total of 40 FCoV strains, including 19 strains from effusions or tissue samples of FIP cats and 21 strains from faecal samples of non-FIP cats, were analysed. Mutation M1058L was detected in 16/18 FCoV-I and 1/1 FCoV-II strains associated with FIP, while change S1060A was presented by two FIPV strains. By phylogenetic analysis, FCoV sequences clustered according to the genotype but not according to the biotype, with FECV/FIPV strains recovered from the same animal being closely related. Further studies are needed to better define the genetic signatures associated with the FECV/FIPV virulence shift.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, infection among health-care professionals and in the context of welfare and health-care facilities was a significant concern. It is known that the elderly or those with concomitant pathologies are at greater risk of a serious evolution of the disease if affected by COVID-19 and that health workers are a category with greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until now, there has been little information on the epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak which did not involve health-care professionals or social and health-care facilities. For this reason, this paper aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population outside these semi-closed communities. METHODS: The study was designed by analyzing the data of the 1371 SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects observed in Sardinia up to 9 July, 2020 and whose data were available in the public health department. Statistical analysis and graphic representation were performed using STATA and Adobe Illustrator, respectively. RESULTS: Of the positive cases analyzed, 323 (23.5%) are health-care workers and 563 (41.1%) reside in social or health-care facilities. The number of positive cases among the general population (subjects who do not belong to these semi-closed communities), is 399 (29.1%), 208 females and 191 males. The estimated Case Fatality Rate stands at 5.0%, which is almost half the rate reported for all the SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (9.8%). The geographical distribution of positive cases differs considerably from the distribution of the totality of cases in Sardinia. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an insight into the COVID-19 situation in the general community, ie not involving health-care professionals or social and health-care facilities. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak outside of these semi-closed communities would provide appropriate information to guide intervention policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the vulnerability of our health-care system. Severe disruptions in care, medicine shortages and unequal access to health-care are but a few examples of the challenges faced by people living in Italy and Europe, highlighting the importance of evidence-based approaches in supporting the development of prevention and response strategies for future pandemics.

AB  - Public health and ethics are commonly regarded as separate concepts. However, this paper argues that public health must be grounded in ethical virtues. The need to carefully integrate ethical practice in public health is a response to ease the negative impact of coronavirus disease 2019 to future generations. Hence, the virtue of compassion is proposed to hurdle the effects of the pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to describe the integrated surveillance system of COVID-19 in Italy, to illustrate the outputs used to return epidemiological information on the spread of the epidemic to the competent public health bodies and to the Italian population, and to describe how the surveillance data contributes to the ongoing weekly regional monitoring and risk assessment system. METHODS: the COVID-19 integrated surveillance system is the result of a close and continuous collaboration between the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), the Italian Ministry of Health, and the regional and local health authorities. Through a web platform, it collects individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and gathers information on their residence, laboratory diagnosis, hospitalisation, clinical status, risk factors, and outcome. Results, for different levels of aggregation and risk categories, are published daily and weekly on the ISS website, and made available to national and regional public health authorities; these results contribute one of the information sources of the regional monitoring and risk assessment system. RESULTS: the COVID-19 integrated surveillance system monitors the space-time distribution of cases and their characteristics. Indicators used in the weekly regional monitoring and risk assessment system include process indicators on completeness and results indicators on weekly trends of newly diagnosed cases per Region. CONCLUSIONS: the outputs of the integrated surveillance system for COVID-19 provide timely information to health authorities and to the general population on the evolution of the epidemic in Italy. They also contribute to the continuous re-assessment of risk related to transmission and impact of the epidemic thus contributing to the management of COVID-19 in Italy.

AB  - The multiple modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission including airborne, droplet, contact, and fecal-oral transmissions that cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contribute to a public threat to the lives of people worldwide. Herein, different databases are reviewed to evaluate modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and study the effects of negative pressure ventilation, air conditioning system, and related protection approaches of this virus. Droplet transmission was commonly reported to occur in particles with diameter >5 µm that can quickly settle gravitationally on surfaces (1-2 m). Instead, fine and ultrafine particles (airborne transmission) can stay suspended for an extended period of time (≥2 h) and be transported further, e.g., up to 8 m through simple diffusion and convection mechanisms. Droplet and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can be limited indoors with adequate ventilation of rooms, by routine disinfection of toilets, using negative pressure rooms, using face masks, and maintaining social distancing. Other preventive measures recommended include increasing the number of screening tests of suspected carriers of SARS-CoV-2, reducing the number of persons in a room to minimize sharing indoor air, and monitoring people's temperature before accessing a building. The work reviews a body of literature supporting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through air, causing COVID-19 disease, which requires coordinated worldwide strategies.

AB  - The need to measure body temperature contactless and quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency has led to the widespread use of infrared thermometers, thermal imaging cameras and thermal scanners as an alternative to the traditional contact clinical thermometers. However, limits and issues of noncontact temperature measurement devices are not well known and technical-scientific literature itself sometimes provides conflicting reference values on the body and skin temperature of healthy subjects. To limit the risk of contagion, national authorities have set the obligation to measure body temperature of workers at the entrance to the workplace. In this paper, the authors analyze noncontact body temperature measurement issues from both clinical and metrological points of view with the aim to (i) improve body temperature measurements accuracy; (ii) estimate the uncertainty of body temperature measurement on the field; (iii) propose a screening decision rule for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19. The approach adopted in this paper takes into account both the traditional instrumental uncertainty sources and clinical-medical ones related to the subjectivity of the measurand. A proper screening protocol for body temperature measurement considering the role of uncertainty is essential to correctly choose the threshold temperature value and measurement method to access critical places during COVID-19 pandemic emergency.

AB  - During the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there was a shortage of masks and respirators for the protection of health care professionals. Masks for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in combination with viral-proof filters, worn by healthcare workers, could serve as an alternative protection measure. We determined the simulated protection factor (SPF) of such devices in comparison to conventional surgical masks, N95, and FFP3 respirators. Masks and respirators were mounted on a ventilated mannequin head in a test-chamber. Isotonic saline containing 150 MBq 99mTC-DTPA (99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) was nebulized inside the box. The aerosol had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 ± 0.4 µm. SPFs were measured using radioactive DTPA particles in the mannequin test system by calculating the ratio of unfiltered particles (Pu) and filtered particles (Pf) for each tested device (SPF = Pu/Pf). Simulated protection factors were 15.6 ± 3.6 for a ResMed AcuCare mask plus filter, 3.5 ± 0.2 for a ResMed Mirage Quattro FX mask plus filter, 9.5 ± 0.8 for a Loewenstein JOYCEclinc FF mask plus filter, 1.9 ± 0.2 for a surgical mask with a rubber band, 2.7 ± 0.7 for a surgical mask with ribbons, 2.3 ± 0.3 for an FFP3 respirator, and 3.6 ± 1.3 for an N95 respirator. The ResMed AcuCare and the Loewenstein JOYCEclinic FF mask were more effective than any other of the tested devices (p < 0.001). In conclusion, masks normally used for NIV with viral-proof filters can effectively filter respirable particles.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented increases in sickness, death, economic disruption, and social disturbances globally. However, the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that caused this pandemic is only one of many viruses threatening public health. Consequently, it is important to have effective means of preventing viral transmission and reducing its devastating effects on human and animal health. Although many antivirals are already available, their efficacy is often limited because of factors such as poor solubility, low permeability, poor bioavailability, un-targeted release, adverse side effects, and antiviral resistance. Many of these problems can be overcome using advanced antiviral delivery systems constructed using nanotechnology principles. These delivery systems consist of antivirals loaded into nanoparticles, which may be fabricated from either synthetic or natural materials. Nevertheless, there is increasing empHasis on the development of antiviral delivery systems from natural substances, such as lipids, phospholipids, surfactants, proteins, and polysaccharides, due to health and environmental issues. The composition, morphology, dimensions, and interfacial characteristics of nanoparticles can be manipulated to improve the handling, stability, and potency of antivirals. This article outlines the major classes of antivirals, summarizes the challenges currently limiting their efficacy, and highlights how nanoparticles can be used to overcome these challenges. Recent studies on the application of antiviral nanoparticle-based delivery systems are reviewed and future directions are described.

AB  - Healthcare systems in many countries have been overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with increasing demands to contain and respond to the virus. The result has been increased pressure on frontline health workers. As the pandemic unfolds, the impact on health systems in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is becoming apparent. In lower resource settings, the detrimental effects on frontline health workers will likely be significant due to fragmented infrastructure, low compensation, and significant shortages of necessary resources such as personal protective equipment. These high stress conditions, coupled with risk of infection and fears and anxieties among patients, can result in grave psychosocial consequences for frontline health workers, who play a vital role in delivering the bulk of primary care services in LMICs. In this narrative review, we consider the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline health workers in LMICs. We describe the important role of frontline health workers, summarize existing literature on burnout and risks to mental health in this essential workforce, and consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns to showcase their vulnerability to mental health impacts of COVID-19. We explore emerging research on the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health workers and consider possible approaches to mitigate these consequences. This review draws from existing studies and emerging evidence to highlight the critical need to consider the wellbeing of frontline health workers, and to address these challenges as health systems respond to the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has been at its peak for the past 6months and has affected more than 215 countries around the world. India is now the 2nd most-affected nation with more than 48,00,000 cases and 79,000 deaths. Despite this, and the fact that it is a lower-middle-income nation the number of deaths is almost 1/3rd of the USA and ½ of Brazil. There has, however, been no experience published from non-COVID designated hospitals where the aim is to manage non-infected cases with neurosurgical ailments while keeping the number of infected cases to a minimum. METHODS: We analyzed the number of neurosurgical cases (non-trauma) done in the past 5 months (March- July 2020) in our institute which is the largest neurosurgical center by volume in southern India and compared the same to the concurrent 5 months in 2019 and 5 months preceding the pandemic. We also reviewed the total number of cases infected with COVID-19 managed during this time. RESULTS: We operated a total of 630 cases(non-trauma) in these 5 months and had 9 COVID-19 infected cases operated during this time. There was a 57% (p=0.002) reduction in the number of cases operated as compared to the same 5 months in the preceding year. We employed a dual strategy of Rapid Antigen testing and surgery for cases needing emergency intervention and Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction test for elective cases. The hospital was divided into three zones (red, orange, and green) depending on infectivity level with minimal interaction. Separate teams were designated for each zone and thus we were able to effectively manage even infected cases despite the absence of pulmonology/medical specialists. CONCLUSION: We present a patient management protocol for non-COVID designated hospitals in high volume centers with the constraints of a lower-middle-income nation and demonstrate its effectiveness. Strict zoning targeted testing and effective triage can help in management during the pandemic.

AB  - In the situation of a shortage of ventilation beds, ethically justifiable, transparent and comprehensible decisions must be made. This concept proposes that all patients are first intubated depending on necessity and then assessed by a triage team afterwards. In this situation newly admitted COVID patients compete with newly admitted Non-COVID patients as well as patients already treated in intensive care units for a ventilator. The combination of short-term and long-term prognoses should enable the interprofessional triage team to make comprehensible decisions. The aim of the prioritization concept is to save as many human lives as possible and to relieve the treatment team of the difficult decision on prioritization.

AB  - Background: A request for consumer health information training for public librarians led to the development of a specialized consumer health reference and health literacy training program by professional consumer health librarians from an academic medical center. Professional consumer health librarians created an interactive presentation aimed at improving public librarians' ability to respond to consumer health questions and provide vetted health resources. Case Presentation: Building on professional expertise, librarians at Weill Cornell Medicine developed a live class demonstration accompanied by a representative subject LibGuide to support public librarians who assist patrons with health questions. Skills involved in effectively communicating with patrons who are seeking consumer health information include conducting reference interviews, matching patrons' needs with appropriate resources, teaching useful Internet search methods, assessing health information, and understanding health literacy issues. Originally envisioned as two in-person live demonstrations, the team proactively adapted the program to respond to the stay-at-home social-distancing order put in place in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusions: The team successfully led an in-person live training session followed by an adapted online training experience, the latter designed to complete the curricula while complying with city and state orders.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has significantly affected the entire world. It was labelled a pandemic by World Health Organization. Although it commonly produces respiratory symptoms, neurological features have been described. Neurological manifestations may vary from non-specific symptoms such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and/or fatigue, olfactory or taste dysfunction to specific syndromes including meningitis, stroke, acute transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This review describes potential pathogenetic mechanisms and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 along with its management. Considering structural and pathogenetic similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS viruses, we compared their neurological manifestations and mentioned few features expected in COVID-19 in future. Interestingly, many COVID-19 cases may present with pure neurological manifestations at onset with non-neurological features manifesting few days later and we propose the term "Neuro-COVID syndrome" for such cases. Awareness of neurological manifestations may facilitate its management and improve outcome in such patients.

AB  - Short synthetic peptide molecules which bind to a specific target protein with a high affinity to exert its function are known as peptide aptamers. The high specificity of aptamers with small-molecule targets (metal ions, dyes and theophylline; ATP) is within 1 pM and 1 μM range, whereas with the proteins (thrombin, CD4 and antibodies) it is in the nanomolar range (which is equivalent to monoclonal antibodies). The recently identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) genome encodes for various proteins, such as envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike protein. Among these, the protein necessary for the virus to enter inside the host cell is spike protein. The work focuses on designing peptide aptamer targeting the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The peptide aptamer has been designed by using bacterial Thioredoxin A as the scaffold protein and an 18-residue-long peptide. The tertiary structure of the peptide aptamer is modeled and docked to spike receptor-binding domain of SARS CoV2. Molecular dynamic simulation has been done to check the stability of the aptamer and receptor-binding domain complex. It was observed that the aptamer binds to spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 in a similar pattern as that of ACE2. The aptamer-receptor-binding domain complex was found to be stable in a 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation. The aptamer is also predicted to be non-antigenic, non-allergenic, non-hemolytic, non-inflammatory, water-soluble with high affinity toward ACE2 than serum albumin. Thus, peptide aptamer can be a novel approach for the therapeutic treatment for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - This paper presents an efficient mechanism for secured encryption of intraoral information in the emerging field of Teledental. Due to global rapid surge in the (Coronavirus Disease) COVID patients, the services of Teledental are best suited in the newer post-COVID era. A devised perceptron has been intelligently embedded with de-multiplexing ability to transmit data to the dentists has been proposed. Exact session key has been developed through learning rules applied on the perceptrons by both the patient and dentist. For simplicity, gingivitis data is highly recommended to transmit in a highly secured manner with patients' data integrity. Gingivitis is an important dental disease which is primarily caused by the bacterial colonization. It shows gum bleeding and inflammations in the gingiva. Encrypted transmission is required to the Dentist for early diagnosis and treatment in Teledental system in this pandemic context. Gingivitis data are then broken into parts by the demultiplexer followed by individual proposed header generation. It is predominantly done to confuse the intruders about the originality of the intraoral data. Chi-square, Avalanche, Strict Avalanche, etc. were carried on the proposed partial shares to generate good outcomes when compared to classical algorithms. To confuse the intruders, character frequency, floating frequency, and autocorrelation were tested extensively. It is a newer approach to avail the secured Teledental features in post-COVID time.

Methods: This is an overview of neurosurgical nurses' challenges and strategies in the current COVID-19 pandemic environment in developing countries. Results: Here, we reviewed the unique challenges of providing neurosurgical nursing services during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries. We address specific issues such as transferring neurosurgical patients, allocating medical supplies, prioritizing neurosurgical services, COVID-19 testing protocols, and patient triage (emergent vs. urgent vs. delayed surgery). Teleconsultation, telenursing services for outpatient treatment, follow-up and virtual teaching strategies associated with neurosurgical nursing are discussed. Conclusion: Neurosurgical nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries requires transparent planning, implementation, and careful consideration of various telemedicine strategies.

AB  - In recent past, major pandemics and epidemics have occurred due to the emergence and resurgence of the novel strains of viruses like Influenza [HINI-A "Spanish Flu", H1N1-Novel A "Swine flu"], Corona [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2)] and Ebola virus [Ebola virus disease]. These infectious diseases may have several ocular manifestations and rarely might be the presenting symptom of the underlying disease. The eyes can act as a portal of entry and/or route of viral transmission for these pathogens. Therefore, an ophthalmologist/optometrist needs to act with ample preparedness and responsibility. Establishing a standard of care in ophthalmic practice by modifying the conventional examination techniques and adopting tele-ophthalmology model to triage the patients can control the community spread of the disease. This article aims to elucidate the ocular manifestations in these pandemics and measures that should be adopted in ophthalmic practice to prevent the disease transmission.

AB  - A great heterogeneity of skin manifestations has been increasingly associated with SARS-CoV2 infection, and especially exanthematous eruptions are considered among early presenting signs in symptomatic patients. In this report, a 58-year-old patient presented with fever, generalized rash and systemic symptoms as urgent consultation to the Dermatology Clinic of Cagliari amidst the Italian outbreak in late March 2020. After a negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, secondary syphilis was confirmed by serological tests and skin biopsy, underlining that, even during a global pandemic, other common and important diseases should not be overlooked. The case also suggests thought on the ineffectiveness of distancing and social containment measures when dealing with sexually transmitted diseases.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having a huge impact on clinical activity of all hospitals, including the ones involved in training of residents. In addition, neurology residents underwent substantial modifications of their training program. Aim of our investigation was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the educational activities of Italian neurology residents through an online questionnaire delivered to neurology residents. The results obtained showed that almost 30% of the respondents were redistributed to COVID-19 units. Neurology departments underwent substantial modifications of their organization influencing clinical educational activities; lessons and seminars were rescheduled online and research protocols were stopped and transferred to remote working, when feasible. There was a relevant use of telemedicine approach even if most of the respondents had never been trained before. Some of the changes had a North-South gradient, following the epidemiology of the pandemic. The data obtained from our survey highlight those points to address to be prepared for possible future emergencies.

AB  - COVID-19 testing has become a standard approach for estimating prevalence which then assist in public health decision making to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease. The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high). Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information. Via an example and a real dataset, we show that the bias corrections can provide dramatic reductions in estimation error.

AB  - The current CoVid-19 crisis is revealing the strengths and the weaknesses of the world's capacity to respond to a global health crisis. A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work, we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies, we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies, we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.

AB  - In 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2/nCoV-19, emerged in Wuhan, China, and has been responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. The evolutionary origins of the virus remain elusive and understanding its complex mutational signatures could guide vaccine design and development. As part of the international "CoronaHack" in April 2020, we employed a collection of contemporary methodologies to compare the genomic sequences of coronaviruses isolated from human (SARS-CoV-2; n = 163), bat (bat-CoV; n = 215) and pangolin (pangolin-CoV; n = 7) available in public repositories. We have also noted the pangolin-CoV isolate MP789 to bare stronger resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 than other pangolin-CoV. Following de novo gene annotation prediction, analyses of gene-gene similarity network, codon usage bias and variant discovery were undertaken. Strong host-associated divergences were noted in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, and in codon usage bias profiles. Last, we have characterised several high impact variants (in-frame insertion/deletion or stop gain) in bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV populations, some of which are found in the same amino acid position and may be highlighting loci of potential functional relevance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus causing a pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-2). Coronaviruses are very diverting genetically and mutate so often periodically. The natural selection of viral mutations may cause host infection selectivity and infectivity. METHODS: This study was aimed to indicate the diversity between human and animal coronaviruses through finding the rate of mutation in each of the spike, nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane proteins. RESULTS: The mutation rate is abundant in all 4 structural proteins. The most number of statistically significant amino acid mutations were found in spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) which may be because it is responsible for a corresponding receptor binding in a broad range of hosts and host selectivity to infect. Among 17 previously known amino acids which are important for binding of spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, all of them are conservative among human coronaviruses, but only 3 of them significantly are mutated in animal coronaviruses. A single amino acid aspartate-454, that causes dissociation of the RBD of the spike and ACE2, and F486 which gives the strength of binding with ACE2 remain intact in all coronaviruses. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Observations of this study provided evidence of the genetic diversity and rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other human and animal coronaviruses.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus; the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Millions of cases and deaths to date have resulted in a global challenge for healthcare systems. COVID-19 has a high mortality rate, especially in elderly individuals with pre-existing chronic comorbidities. There are currently no effective therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, the identification of effective therapeutics is a necessity. Terpenes are the largest class of natural products that could serve as a source of new drugs or as prototypes for the development of effective pharmacotherapeutic agents. In the present study, we discuss the antiviral activity of these natural products and we perform simulations against the Mpro and PLpro enzymes of SARS-CoV-2. Our results strongly suggest the potential of these compounds against human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For medical students seeking additional specialty experience in Med-Peds, in-person electives have often been a source of mentorship and guidance. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability for the completion of in-person clerkships for medical students across the nation. Virtual opportunities to increase exposure to Med-Peds programs and didactics are lacking at this time. Objective: To develop a virtual Med-Peds student elective that serves to increase awareness of the Med-Peds specialty, exposure to Med-Peds topics and relevant didactics, and exposure to Med-Peds specific mentorship when on-site clerkships are not available due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Fifteen medical students participated in a virtual Med-Peds student elective utilizing Zoom (Zoom Inc, San Jose, CA). Three separate cohorts of five students each completed two-week elective experiences. The virtual elective curriculum was created using asynchronous and synchronous learning modalities. Sessions were composed of self-directed learning topics, peer-to-peer interactive case discussions, resident-led didactics, and attending physician-led didactics and mentorship sessions. A pre-survey was administered at the beginning of the elective and a post-survey was administered at the end of the elective to assess the effectiveness of the elective, student experiences with Med-Peds mentors, and students' general perceptions of Med-Peds as a residency application choice. Results: All students (100%), rated the Med-Peds elective to have exceeded their expectations. All students indicated this elective had been extremely (100%) valuable to increase their understanding and interest in Med-Peds (top rating on a five-point Likert scale). Compared to prior to the elective, most were very likely (87%) or likely (7%) to apply to Med-Peds as their top (preferred) specialty. Similar to pre-survey data, one-third (33%) of the students were still likely to apply to an alternate specialty in addition to Med-Peds. Hundred percent of students indicated that the mentorship component of the elective exceeded their original expectations. While most students indicated that they are much more strongly considering applying to Med-Peds as a top (preferred) specialty, the number of students who continue to consider dual-application to include either categorical Internal Medicine, categorical Pediatrics, or Family Medicine did not differ before and after completion of the virtual elective. Conclusions: Implementation of a virtual medical student elective focusing on exposure to Med-Peds can strengthen medical students' interest in the combined specialty despite a paucity of previous experiences or an affiliated Med-Peds program. This new type of rotation can positively impact a student's view of a hospital system and a residency program when in-person clinical rotations are not available.

AB  - As COVID-19 hit in the Spring of 2020, substantial challenges began to emerge for individuals around the world. In this empirical piece we examine the impacts of COVID-19 in the sport for development (SFD) context, as it relates to the individual participant, as well as how those individual needs impact the organization itself. This case study, explores a hybrid SFD organization, Highway of Hope (HOH) in Kenya, and the actions of local leadership in response to emergent participant needs during the onset of the pandemic. Using a case study approach, involving journal responses from program youth participants and local program leadership, along with other field and meeting notes, themes were generated to highlight the most salient challenges and experiences faced by individual participants, as well as the means of addressing those challenges by HOH. Participant journals consisted of both positive and negative thematic findings. Positive experiences included Family Time, Rest, and Practicing Better Hygiene, while negative experiences revolved around Restriction of Activity, and Difficulty at Home. The overall impact on participant lives were expressed in themes such as Socio-emotional, Physical, and Sport-Specific. Further, practical implications for grassroots and hybrid SFD programs during times of unprecedented challenge and notable turning points are highlighted.

AB  - Along with emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, a myriad of neurologic symptoms, associated with structural brain changes, were reported. In this paper, we provide evidence to critically discuss the claim that the survived patients could possibly be at increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases via various mechanisms. This virus can directly invade the brain through olfactory bulb, retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerve endings, or via hematogenous or lymphatic routes. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes activation results in pro-inflammatory cytokine increment, rendering the brain to neurodegenerative changes. Also, occupation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) with the virus may lead to a decline in ACE-2 activity, which acts as a neuroprotective factor. Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septicemia induce hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, which are locally exacerbated due to the hypercoagulable state and micro-thrombosis in brain vessels, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Common risk factors for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases, such as metabolic risk factors, genetic predispositions, and even gut microbiota dysbiosis, can contribute to higher occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases in COVID-19 survivors. However, it should be considered that severity of the infection, the extent of neurologic symptoms, and the persistence of viral infection consequences are major determinants of this association. Importantly, whether this pandemic will increase the overall incidence of neurodegeneration is not clear, as a high percentage of patients with severe form of COVID-19 might probably not survive enough to develop neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications. In this review, we will discuss the importance of Mg for the immune system and for infectious diseases, including the recent pandemic of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2018, influenza and pneumonia was the 8th leading cause of death in the United States (US). Since 1950, non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) have experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Previous studies revealed geographic variation in mortality rates by race. The identification of areas with the greatest disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality may assist policy makers in the allocation of resources including for the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does geographic variation in racial disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality exist? STUDY DESIGN: and Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database for multiple cause of death between 1999-2018 for NHB and NHW decedents aged ≥ 25 years with an ICD-10 code for influenza (J09-J11) and pneumonia (J12-J18) was used. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)were computed by race for Health & Human Services (HHS) regions and urbanization in non-Hispanics RESULTS: In 1999-2018, there were 540,476 deaths among NHB and NHW aged 25-84 years. AAMR was higher in NHB than NHW in each age group and in 7 of 10 HHS regions. The greatest disparity was in HHS regions 2 (NY, NJ) and 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada). In HHS region 2, NHB [24.6 (95% CI 24.1-25.1)] were more likely to die than NHW [15.7 (95% CI 15.6-15.9)]. Similarly, in region 9, NHB [23.2 (95% CI 22.7-23.8)] had higher mortality than NHW [16.1 (95% CI 15.9-16.2)]. Within these regions, disparities were greatest in the core of major metropolitan areas. Much of the disparity was due to very high mortality rates in NHB in these areas: region 2 large central metro areas NHB 28.2 (95% CI 27.6-28.9). INTERPRETATION: In 1999-2018 the NHB-NHW disparity in AAMR from influenza and pneumonia was greatest in central metro areas of HHS regions 2 and 9.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the deadly respiratory disease called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing global public health emergency that has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We review literature on the transmission and control of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the challenges of focusing on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as critical control measures in low-income countries. A significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related deaths has been reported for the United States of America and other high-income countries in Europe and Asia, regardless of advanced medical facilities in those countries. In contrast, much lower COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality rates have been documented in many low-income countries, despite having comparatively higher socioeconomic burdens and suboptimal medical facilities. By September 29, 2020 over one million deaths have been reported. On the same day, the cumulative total of COVID-19 related morbidity for Africa was 35,954 with 3.5% of the global COVID-19 related deaths. We present arguments for the relatively low COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates in many low-income countries and discuss the critical importance of WASH for preventing the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. We observe that the key recommendations put forward by the World Health Organization to effectively control the pandemic have been difficult to implement in low-income countries. We conclude that the pandemic reinforces previous pronouncements that adequate and effective WASH measures are crucial for public health and recommend closer coordination between public health and WASH sectors.

AB  - Systematic reviews have shown a prevalence close to 20% of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients, with nearly 40% of patients shedding viral RNA in their faeces, even if it may not be infectious, possibly because of inactivation by colonic fluid.According to current evidence, this virus is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and contact routes, including contaminated surfaces. The virus is quite stable on stainless steel, being detected up to 48-72 hours after application. Therefore, some individuals can be infected touching common contaminated surfaces, such as bathroom taps. Taps can be underestimated critical points in the transmission chain of the infection. Indeed, just by turning the knob, people leave germs on it, especially after coughing over their hands, sneezing, and/or blowing their nose. After handwashing with soap, user take back their germs when turning the knob. Paradoxically, the following user collects the germs back on his/her fingers by implementing a preventive measure, maybe before putting food into the mouth or wearing contact lenses.The Italian National Institute of Health recommends to clean and disinfect high-touched surfaces, but it is unrealistic and inefficient to do so after each tap use. As an alternative, new toilets should install long elbow-levers - or at least short levers - provided that people are educated to close them with the forearm or the side of the hand. This is already a standard measure in hospitals, but it is particularly important also in high-risk communities, such as retirement homes and prisons. It would be important also in schools, in workplaces, and even in families, contributing to the prevention both of orofaecal and respiratory infections.In the meantime, people should be educated to close existing knobs with disposable paper towel wipes or with toilet paper sheets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic governments have taken actions to limit the transmission of the virus such as lockdown measures and reorganization of the local Health System. Quarantine measures have influenced pregnant women's daily lives. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of the changes imposed by COVID-19 emergency on the wellbeing of pregnant women and how the transformation of Schiavonia Hospital into a dedicated Covid Hospital affected their pregnancy experience. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Pregnant women who gave birth in Schiavonia Hospital during the period May-September 2020 have been included. The assessment examined clinical characteristics, attitudes in relation to the pandemic and how it affected birth plans, perception of information received and attitudes regards giving birth in a Covid Hospital. RESULTS: 104 women responded to the survey, with an enrolment rate of 58%. About the influence of COVID-19 pandemic, 51% of respondents reported changing some aspect of their lifestyle. The identification of Schiavonia hospital as Covid Hospital did not modify the trust in the facility and in the Obstetrics Ward for the 90% of women, in fact for the 85,6% it was the planned Birth Centre since the beginning of pregnancy. The communication was complete and exhaustive for 82,7% of the respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the Covid Hospital transformation, the women who came to give birth at Schiavonia Birth Centre rated the healthcare assistance received at high level, evidencing high affection for the structure and the healthcare workers.

AB  - PURPOSE: Approximately 20% of caregivers (CGs) live > 1 hour away from the patient and are considered distance caregivers (DCGs) who often report higher distress and anxiety than local CGs. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at reducing anxiety and distress in DCGs of patients with cancer. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled DCGs of patients with all cancer types who were being seen monthly by oncologists in outpatient clinics. There were three arms of the intervention delivered over a 4-month period: arm 1 (a) received 4 monthly videoconference-tailored coaching sessions with an advanced practice nurse or social worker focused on information and support, (b) participated in patient's appointments with the oncologist via videoconference over the 4-month study period, and (c) had access to a website designed for DCGs. Arm 2 did not receive the coaching sessions but received the other two components, and arm 3 received access to the DCG website only. RESULTS: There were 302 DCGs who provided pre- and postintervention data. There were significant anxiety by group (P = .028 and r = 0.16) and distress by group interactions (P = .014 and r = 0.17). Arm 1 had the greatest percentage of DCGs who demonstrated improvement in anxiety (18.6%) and distress (25.2%). CONCLUSION: Coaching and use of videoconference technology (to join the DCG into the patient-oncologist office visit) were effective in reducing both anxiety and distress for DCGs. These components could be considered for local CGs who-with COVID-19-are unable to accompany the patient to oncologist visits.

AB  - This special issue on the impacts of COVID-19 on LGBTQ+ health and well-being reports findings from nine articles with varied study designs, including data from multiple countries and all segments of LGBTQ+ communities. Key findings included the observation that pre-COVID mental health disparities predispose LGBTQ+ people to poorer outcomes; that technological communication aids are essential in maintaining some sense of community; and that substance use is perceived by sexual minority women as a means of coping with fears, stress, loneliness, and boredom. Studies in this special issue also document that community support is still a critical need, particularly among those who are sheltering at home with families of origin. Findings underscore the importance of addressing structural inequities, including advocating for rights; providing financial support for LGBTQ+ community organizations and networks; ensuring access to competent and affirming healthcare; and including vulnerable communities in disaster response and planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obtaining vascular access is one of the key procedures in patients in emergency settings. AIMS: The study was conducted as a meta-analysis and a systematic review, with the aim of addressing the following question: Which intravascular access method shouldbe used when wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE)to patients with COVID-19? METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing intravascular access methods performed by operators wearing full level C PPE. We evaluated the procedure time and success rate of intraosseous and peripheral intravenous access. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included in quantitative synthesis. The use of PPE during intravascular access procedures has an influence on the procedure time of intraosseous access (MD=11.69; 95%CI: 6.47, 16.92; P<0.001), as well as reduced the success rate by 0.8% in intraosseous access and by 10.1% in intravenous access. Under PPE conditions, intraosseous access, compared with peripheral intravenous access, offered a shorter procedure time (MD = -41.43; 95% CI: -62.36, -24.47; P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that the use of PPE significantly extends the duration of intravascular procedures. However, under PPE conditions, operators were able to obtain intraosseousaccess in a significantly shorter time and with a higher success rate.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has no publicly available vaccine or antiviral drugs at the time of writing. An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition, targeting regions other than the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an elastic network model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse its dynamics and thermodynamics. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric protease's active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site, yet control the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragment-based binding screens. The results also provide new insights into the active biophysical research field of protein fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 testing is crucial to controlling the spread of this virus, yet shortages of nucleic acid extraction supplies and other key reagents have hindered the response to COVID-19 in the US. Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Frequent surveillance of individuals attending work or school is currently unavailable to most people but will likely be necessary to reduce the ~50% of transmission that occurs when individuals are nonsymptomatic. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed primary samples with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~625 copies/μl, approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. While less sensitive than extraction-based molecular methods, RT-LAMP without RNA extraction is fast and inexpensive. Here we also demonstrate that adding a lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained.

AB  - The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought into sharp focus the conundrum of how to balance evidence-based prescribing vs empiric treatment with repurposed drugs for a pandemic with a high mortality risk. Initial attention focused on hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine due to evidence of in vitro activity against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,1 yet the external validity of these data was limited by knowledge that in vitro antiviral activity did not equate to efficacy in randomised controlled trails (RCTs) of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment for influenza, dengue, chikungunya, and human immunodeficiency virus infection.1.

AB  - The dreadful fear of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the deadly consequences, requires rapid development of pharmacological cures. The objective of this review is to speculate about possible pharmacological options, already available today to prevent or treat the COVID-19 in the early stage of its outbreak. A literature search across PubMed and internet was conducted. A number of studies dealing with COVID-19 were identified. The data elucidated that increased pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines in combination with hypoxia, thromboembolism and pneumonia are involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although many drugs has been tested in monotherapy regimen with varying outcome or without desirable effect, there is still hope for better results by simultaneously targeting the virus itself and its symptoms. Theoretically, a mixture of at least two available antiviral drugs in combination with other anti-pathogenic and immune system-enhancing drugs or combination of antiviral drugs with convalescent plasma seems likely to have much better effect than the monotherapy regimen of either of these drugs.

AB  - Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 8000 individuals. The eponym recognises the 19th-century physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu and Frederick Parkes Weber who each independently described the disease. It is characterised by epistaxis, telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Individuals with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor beta and vascular endothelial growth factor secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4. Pulmonary artery malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal communications between pulmonary arteries and veins and are found in up to 50% of individuals with HHT. The clinical features suggestive of PAVMs are stigmata of right to left shunting such as dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, cyanosis, cerebral embolism and unexplained haemoptysis or haemothorax. The authors present the case of a 33-year-old woman presenting with progressive dyspnoea during the COVID-19 pandemic. She had a typical presentation of HHT with recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Although rare, PAVM should be considered in individuals presenting to the emergency department with dyspnoea and hypoxaemia. Delayed diagnosis can result in fatal embolic and haemorrhagic complications.

AB  - Coping with the COVID-19 pandemic has required measures to contain the contagion, including social isolation. However, this and other factors have caused mental health problems, both in patients and health professionals and in family members or asymptomatic population. Religious support can be an ally for this type of confrontation. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, spiritual/religious care has been restricted and insufficient. When accessible to patients and frontline professionals, they are offered by virtual means, almost always by recorded media and made available in bulk. This essay argues, based on references in the areas of psychology, psychoneuroimmunology, biosafety, and military, that the face-to-face and personalized relationship between religious leaders, patients, health professionals, family members, and faith communities is as essential as possible for the dignified treatment victims, referral to spiritual needs and resilience of society, in addition to contributing to the improvement of the immune response of all. Practical examples are cited in the areas of military chaplaincy and hospital civilian chaplaincy. The essay also proposes the adoption of protocols already published by WHO and other safety measures such as the use of robotics and the recruitment/training of mass chaplains. In addition to contributing to the improvement of COVID-19 pandemic coping processes, the study also contributes to improving the delivery of spiritual/religious care as an ally to physical and mental, individual, and collective health.

AB  - Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic leading to unprecedented disruption of global health and economy. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been found to be critical in priming the viral spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor before the virus enters into the host cell. Recent studies have experimentally demonstrated that Alpha 1 antitrypsin (encoded by SERPINA1 gene) is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and provided support to the already approved therapy as a candidate for COVID-19. Interestingly Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is common among Europeans. Here we have provided in silico evidence that Alpha 1 antitrypsin can interact with TMPRSS2 and both of them are co-expressed in the human liver and lung. We then analyzed the gnomAD dataset to show that Europeans and Latinos have a substantially higher carrier frequency of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (~12%) compared to other large ethnicities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency might be a risk factor for severe infection with SARS-CoV-2. We propose Alpha 1 antitrypsin status as a potential prognostic predictor of COVID-19 outcome.

AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal and pandemic disease discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, with lots of asymptomatic cases and a long incubation period. The researchers suggested that high d-dimer levels could predict disease severity, lung complications, and thromboembolic events before they occur. Materials and Methods: We searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords "D-dimer" and "coronavirus" or "D-dimer" and "COVID-19." We used Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) to build forest plots of continuous data and assess differences in serum D-dimer concentrations between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 disease. We evaluated p-value < 0.05 as statistically significant and preferred 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result: The pooled results of all studies revealed that the D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 (SMD: 2.32 μg/mL; 95% CI, 0.72 3.92 μg/mL, p< 0.001). We evaluated severe patients with total D-dimer levels. D-dimer concentrations were significantly higher in severe patients against total COVID-19 patients (SMD: 2.01 μg/mL; 95% CI, 0.25 to 3.77 μg/mL, p= 0.08). Conclusions: We do not know the D-dimer increment mechanism in severe patients yet, but we think that these findings will be useful in the early diagnosis of severe disease and the first treatment.

AB  - Shortages of masks, personal protective equipment (PPE), and ventilators characterized the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in the United States. As supply deficiencies strained healthcare systems across the country, national attention focused on the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), overseen by the US Department of Health & Human Services-specifically, its inability to significantly alleviate rapidly deteriorating conditions in hospitals. While nominally a "stockpile," the SNS does not possess, operate, or restock a vast system of federally owned warehouses filled with enough medical equipment to weather a crisis. Instead, as summarized in a June 2020 RAND Corporation report and testimony to the US Congress, the program is primarily a logistics service that coordinates the flow of materials between state and local entities, and its own small stockpile was quickly overwhelmed by the demands of the pandemic.

AB  - It is impossible to write this editorial without recognizing that we are living in challenging times. Unprecedented changes in how, when, where, and with whom we work have occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the threat to human life, the pandemic is expected to increase poverty and deepen preexisting inequalities for vulnerable groups such as women (United Nations, 2020) and individuals living in poorer countries (United Nations Development Programme, 2020). In the United States, the pandemic has disproportionately negatively affected racial and ethnic minority group members (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html). For example, in the United States infection and mortality rates are especially high among African Americans (Yancy, 2020). These sobering realities, along with the recent deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, and so many others, are vivid and wrenching reminders of longstanding social injustice and systematic racism, both in the United States and around the globe. When preparing my candidate statement and vision for the journal, a global pandemic and widespread social protest were the furthest thing from my mind. However, several aspects of my vision for JAP are highly relevant to the current context. This includes increasing representation and supporting diversity, as well as improving the translation of our science for the public good. Other elements of my vision for the journal include enhancing the review process and promoting open science. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - With people trying to keep a safe distance from others due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the way in which pedestrians walk has completely changed since the pandemic broke out1,2. In this work, laboratory experiments demonstrate the effect of several variables-such as the pedestrian density, the walking speed and the prescribed safety distance-on the interpersonal distance established when people move within relatively dense crowds. Notably, we observe that the density should not be higher than 0.16 pedestrians per square meter (around 6 m2 per pedestrian) in order to guarantee an interpersonal distance of 1 m. Although the extrapolation of our findings to other more realistic scenarios is not straightforward, they can be used as a first approach to establish density restrictions in urban and architectonic spaces based on scientific evidence.

Here we report that the commonly used stabilized S ectodomain construct '2P' is sensitive to cold temperatures, and this cold sensitivity is abrogated in a 'down' state-stabilized ectodomain. Our findings will impact structural, functional and vaccine studies that use the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain.

AB  - New Coronavirus which is called 2019-nCoV (2019-Novel-Coronavirus) or SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2) causes deadly pneumonia that first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan city in China. This virus spreads all over the world quickly and made several problems for the community and healthcare system. Several drugs have been tried to manage COVID-19; however, our knowledge of this virus is not complete. At any rate, effective treatment or vaccine for this disease has not been discovered yet. Furthermore, to achieve this goal, more studies are needed on the structure of the virus and its pathogenesis mechanism. In this article, we summarized several articles suggesting treatments of COVID-19.

AB  - In November 2009, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first noticed in the city of Wuhan in China, rapidly spreading to assume pandemic proportions within a short period of time. The disease was subsequently designated as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The death toll has continued to rise with grave health and socio-economic implications for individuals, families and nations globally. Although the respiratory tract is primarily involved in this disease, kidney affectation is increasingly reported and has been shown to worsen the prognosis of the disease. Current evidence shows that kidney disease is not uncommon in patients with coronavirus infection especially in those with COVID-19 and may arise from a constellation of factors such as hypotension, sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, multi-organ failure, use of nephrotoxic medications as well as direct infection in some cases. Factors associated with acute kidney injury in coronavirus infected patients may include elderly age, male sex, presence of co-morbidities as well as pre-existing chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease. Although, there is presently no effective treatment for COVID-19, there is room for conservative management, extracorporeal therapy and renal replacement therapy. The aim of this review was to integrate current and emerging evidences on renal disease resulting from COVID-19 and the previous epidemics of coronavirus infections including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by other strains of the virus.

AB  - Drug repurposing for COVID-19 has several potential benefits including shorter development time, reduced costs and regulatory support for faster time to market for treatment that can alleviate the current pandemic. The current study used molecular docking, molecular dynamics and protein-protein interaction simulations to predict drugs from the Drug Bank that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacting surface on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The study predicted a number of peptide-based drugs, including Sar9 Met (O2)11-Substance P and BV2, that might bind sufficiently to the hACE2 receptor to modulate the protein-protein interaction required for infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Such drugs could be validated in vitro or in vivo as potential inhibitors of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) in the airway. Exploration of the proposed and current pharmacological indications of the peptide drugs predicted as potential inhibitors of the interaction between the spike protein and hACE2 receptor revealed that some of the predicted peptide drugs have been investigated for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), viral infection, inflammation and angioedema, and to stimulate the immune system, and potentiate antiviral agents against influenza virus. Furthermore, these predicted drug hits may be used as a basis to design new peptide or peptidomimetic drugs with better affinity and specificity for the hACE2 receptor that may prevent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and hACE2 that is prerequisite to the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The damage inflicted by the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upon humanity is and will continue to be considerable. Unprecedented progress made in global health over the past 20 years has reverted and economic growth has already evaporated, giving rise to a global recession, the likes of which we may not have experienced since the Second World War. Our aim is to draw the attention of the neglected tropical disease (NTD) community towards some of the major emerging economic opportunities which are quickly appearing on the horizon as a result of COVID-19. MAIN TEXT: This scoping review relied on a literature search comprised of a sample of articles, statements, and press releases on initiatives aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19, while supporting economic recovery. Of note, the donor scenario and economic development agendas are highly dynamic and expected to change rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, as are donor and lender priorities. CONCLUSIONS: The NTD community, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), will need to work quickly, diligently, and in close collaboration with decision-makers and key stakeholders, across sectors at national and international level to secure its position. Doing so might enhance the odds of grasping potential opportunities to access some of the massive resources that are now available in the form of contributions from corporate foundations, trust funds, loans, debt relieve schemes, and other financial mechanisms, as part of the ongoing and future economic development agendas and public health priorities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper should serve as a starting point for the NTD community to seek much needed financial support in order to sustain and revitalize control and elimination efforts pertaining to NTDs in LMICs.

AB  - Introduction The objectives were to characterise the particle size distribution of aerosols generated by standard dental aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) and to assess the impact of aerosol-management interventions on 'fallow time'. Interventions included combinations of high-volume intraoral suction (HVS[IO]), high-volume extraoral suction (HVS[EO]) and an air cleaning system (ACS).Method A sequence of six AGPs were performed on a phantom head. Real-time aerosol measurements (particle size range 0.0062-9.6 μm) were acquired from six locations within a typical dental treatment room (35 m3).Results The majority (>99%) of AGP particles were <0.3 μm diameter and remained at elevated levels around the dental team during the AGPs. With no active aerosol-management interventions, AGP particles were estimated to remain above the baseline range for up to 30 minutes from the end of the sequence of procedures.Conclusions The results emphasise the importance of personal protection equipment, particularly respiratory protection. Use of HVS(IO), either alone or in combination with the ACS, reduced particle concentrations to baseline levels on completion of AGPs. These data indicate potential to eliminate fallow time. The study was performed using a phantom head so confirmatory studies with patients are required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected diagnosis and treatment of noncommunicable diseases. Its effects on delivery of diagnostic care for cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide, have not been quantified. OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess COVID-19's impact on global cardiovascular diagnostic procedural volumes and safety practices. METHODS: The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a worldwide survey assessing alterations in cardiovascular procedure volumes and safety practices resulting from COVID-19. Noninvasive and invasive cardiac testing volumes were obtained from participating sites for March and April 2020 and compared with those from March 2019. Availability of personal protective equipment and pandemic-related testing practice changes were ascertained. RESULTS: Surveys were submitted from 909 inpatient and outpatient centers performing cardiac diagnostic procedures, in 108 countries. Procedure volumes decreased 42% from March 2019 to March 2020, and 64% from March 2019 to April 2020. Transthoracic echocardiography decreased by 59%, transesophageal echocardiography 76%, and stress tests 78%, which varied between stress modalities. Coronary angiography (invasive or computed tomography) decreased 55% (p < 0.001 for each procedure). In multivariable regression, significantly greater reduction in procedures occurred for centers in countries with lower gross domestic product. Location in a low-income and lower-middle-income country was associated with an additional 22% reduction in cardiac procedures and less availability of personal protective equipment and telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 was associated with a significant and abrupt reduction in cardiovascular diagnostic testing across the globe, especially affecting the world's economically challenged. Further study of cardiovascular outcomes and COVID-19-related changes in care delivery is warranted.

AB  - Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug indicated in the treatment of acute attacks of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and susceptible strains of P. falciparum. It is also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and more recently proposed in COVID-19 therapy. Hydroxychloroquine is only available in tablets which are not easy to administer for pediatric and geriatric patients, and patients unable to swallow such as patients found in intensive care units. The aim of this work was to develop and optimize a ready to use liquid hydroxychloroquine formulation and to carry out the corresponding chemical and microbiological stability studies. The formulation was evaluated for ease of preparation, physical properties, and palatability. Its stability was performed at ambient temperature and under refrigeration. After 6 months of stability testing, the results showed no pH change, no drug loss, no microbial development, and no visual change. The formulation, employing excipients in a range that EMA has recommended, showed chemical and microbiological stability for at least 6 months even in the worst storage conditions.

AB  - Currently, no single medication has been approved for the management of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, drug repositioningby investigating the use of existing drugs for management of COVID-19 patients is considered a desperate need. Tramadol is a commonly prescribed analgesic drug for treatment of moderate to severe pain with less potential for dependence and respiratory depression. Multiple evidence support that tramadol is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Herein, we discuss the possible beneficial effects of using tramadol against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effect of tramadol may help to suppress the COVID-19 related cytokine storm through decreasing interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Besides, tramadol activates natural killer (NK) and T-cells and enhances IL-2 secretion, which produce immune-enhancing effect against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure showed increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may lead to thrombosis. Tramadol owing to its hypocoagulable effect may protect against venous thromboembolism in these patients. Moreover, tramadol can exert a cardioprotective effect via decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level which is elevated in most of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with old age patients, which may be due to the lack of antioxidant mechanisms and increased oxidative damage. Tramadol could protect COVID-19 patient from disease complications by increases the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase while diminished malondialdehyde. More interestingly, tramadol as an effective analgesic and antitussive may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients suffering from cough, headache, ache, and pain. The tramadol anti-psychotic effect may also protect against psychiatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, tramadol has bactericidal activity against a wide range of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is common in severe COVID-19 patients leading to pneumonia with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that tramadol might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on that, tramadol should be considered as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 clinical trials.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has presented enormous challenges for healthcare, societal, and economic systems worldwide. There is an urgent global need for a universal vaccine to cover all SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains to stop the current COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of an inevitable second wave of coronavirus. Carbon dioxide is safe and superior antimicrobial, which suggests it should be effective against coronaviruses and mutants thereof. Depending on the therapeutic regime, CO2 could also ameliorate other COVID-19 symptoms as it has also been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-cytokine effects, and to stimulate the human immune system. Moreover, CO2 has beneficial effects on respiratory physiology, cardiovascular health, and human nervous systems. This article reviews the rationale of early treatment by inhaling safe doses of warmed humidified CO2 gas, either alone or as a carrier gas to deliver other inhaled drugs may help save lives by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections and excessive inflammatory responses. We suggest testing this somewhat counter-intuitive, but low tech and safe intervention for its suitability as a preventive measure and treatment against COVID-19. Overall, development and evaluation of this therapy now may provide a safe and economical tool for use not only during the current pandemic but also for any future outbreaks of respiratory diseases and related conditions.

AB  - Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic virus has been spreading throughout the world. Until now, no certified drugs have been discovered to efficiently inhibit the virus. The scientists are struggling to find new safe bioactive inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, we aim to find antagonists that may inhibit the activity of the three major viral targets: SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (6LU7), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (6VYB), and a host target human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1R42), which is the entry point for the viral encounter, were studied with the prospects of identifying significant drug candidate(s) against COVID-19 infection. Then, the protein stability produced score of less than 0.6 for all residues of all studied receptors. This confirmed that these receptors are extremely stable proteins, so it is very difficult to unstable the stability of these proteins through utilizing individual drugs. Hence, we studied the combination and tricombination therapy between bioactive compounds which have the best binding affinity and some antiviral drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, simeprevir, baloxavir, lopinavir, and favipiravir to show the effect of combination and tricombination therapy to disrupt the stability of the three major viral targets that are mentioned previously. Also, ADMET study suggested that most of all studied bioactive compounds are safe and nontoxic compounds. All results confirmed that caulerpin can be utilized as a combination and tricombination therapy along with the studied antiviral drugs for disrupting the stability of the three major viral receptors (6LU7, 6VYB, and 1R42).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Air pollution has been linked to increased mortality and morbidity. The Program 4 of the Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment study investigates whether the health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity (PA) can be fully realized in individuals living in highly polluted environments. Herein, we introduce the behavioral, psychological and neuroimaging protocol of the study. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of N = 1500 individuals aged 18-65 years comparing: (1) individuals living in the highly polluted, industrial region surrounding the city of Ostrava (n = 750), and (2) controls from the comparison region with relative low pollution levels in Southern Bohemia (n = 750). Quota sampling is used to obtain samples balanced on age, gender, PA status (60% active runners vs. 40% insufficiently active). Participants are screened and complete baseline assessments through online questionnaires and in-person lab-based assessments of physiological, biomechanical, neuroimaging and cognitive function parameters. Prospective 12-month intensive monitoring of air pollution and behavioral parameters (PA, inactivity, and sleep) follows, with a focus on PA-related injuries and psychological factors through fitness trackers, smartphones, and mobile apps. Subsequently, there will be a 5-year follow-up of the study cohort. DISCUSSION: The design of the study will allow for (1) the assessment of both short-term variation and long-term change in behavioral parameters, (2) evaluation of the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries and psychological factors impacting behavior and injury recovery, and (3) the impact that air pollution status (and change) has on behavior, psychological resilience, and injury recovery. Furthermore, the integration of MRI techniques and cognitive assessment in combination with data on behavioral, biological and environmental variables will provide an opportunity to examine brain structure and cognitive function in relation to health behavior and air pollution, as well as other factors affecting resilience against and vulnerability to adverse changes in brain structure and cognitive aging. This study will help inform individuals about personal risk factors and decision-makers about the impact of environmental factors on negative health outcomes and potential underlying biological, behavioral and psychological mechanisms. Challenges and opportunities stemming from the timing of the study that coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.

AB  - The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Clinically, respiratory tract symptoms as well as other organs disorders are observed in patients positively diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, neurological symptoms, mainly anosmia, ageusia and headache were observed in many patients. Once in the central nervous system (CNS), the SARS-CoV-2 can reside either in a quiescent latent state, or eventually in actively state leading to severe acute encephalitis, characterized by neuroinflammation and prolonged neuroimmune activation. SRAS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The expression of this receptor in endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows that SRAS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to known coronaviruses. This review summarizes available information regarding the impact of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain and tended to identify its potential pathways of neuroinvasion. We offer also an understanding of the long-term impact of latently form of SARS-CoV-2 on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. As a conclusion, the persistent infection of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain could be involved on human neurodegenerative diseases that evolve a gradual process, perhapes, over several decades.

AB  - Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) are seriously affecting human health all over the world. Nucleotide inhibitors have promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral polymerases. In this study, detailed molecular docking and dynamics simulations are used to evaluate the binding affinity of a clinically approved drug, sofosbuvir, with the solved structure of the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and compare it to the clinically approved drug, Remdesivir. These drugs are docked onto the three-dimensional structure of the nsp12 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which controls the polymerization process. Hence, it is considered one of the primary therapeutic targets for coronaviruses. Sofosbuvir is a drug that is currently used for HCV treatment; therefore, HCV RdRp is used as a positive control protein target. The protein dynamics are simulated for 100 ns, while the binding is tested during different dynamics states of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, the drug-protein complexes are further simulated for 20 ns to explore the binding mechanism. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as a target with the active form of sofosbuvir as a ligand demonstrates binding effectiveness. One of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs, such as sofosbuvir, can help us in this mission, aiming to limit the danger of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir was found to bind nsp12 with comparable binding energies to that of Remdesivir, which has been reported for its potential against COVID-19 RdRp and is currently approved by the FDA.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the computerisation and online delivery of postgraduate examinations. Social distancing regulations and lockdown measures resulted in many written and clinical examinations being cancelled during the initial surge of the virus. In an effort to reinstate the assessment of trainees and enable career progression, the UK medical regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC) has approved unprecedented changes to clinical examinations, including virtual assessment. We outline the changes made and the advantages and disadvantages of these new examination formats. We discuss ways for candidates and examiners to optimise their virtual environment and develop skills that can improve performance.

AB  - Models predict that the negative effects of delayed implementation in trachoma elimination programmes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will be minimal, except in high prevalence districts where progress may be reversed. During times of change we must stand by our principles of evidence-based decision-making, but also be willing to show flexibility. Slow progress to elimination in high prevalence districts was already a significant challenge to the global programme and mitigation of COVID-related delays with enhanced implementation provides an opportunity to simultaneously address an unprecedented challenge and a pre-existing one.

AB  - No one may be refused emergency medical treatment in South Africa (SA). Yet score-based categorical exclusions used in critical care triage guidelines disproportionately discriminate against older adults, the cognitively and physically impaired, and the disabled. Adults over the age of 60, who make up 9.1% of the SA population, are most likely to present with disabilities and comorbidities at triage. Score-based models, drawn from international precedents, deny these patients admission to an ICU when resources are constrained, such as during influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa and the South African Medical Association adopted the Clinical Frailty Scale, which progressively withholds admission to ICUs based on age, frailty and comorbidities in a manner that potentially contravenes constitutional and equality prohibitions against unfair discrimination. The legal implications for healthcare providers are extensive, ranging from personal liability to hate speech and crimes against humanity. COVID-19 guidelines and score-based triage protocols must be revised urgently to eliminate unlawful discrimination against legally protected categories of patients in SA, including the disabled and the elderly. That will ensure legal certainty for health practitioners, and secure the full protections of the law to which the health-vulnerable and those of advanced age are constitutionally entitled.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019 and has affected millions of lives worldwide, while many aspects of the illness are still unknown. Current data show that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffer from kidney damage, in the form of proteinuria, hematuria or acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is especially prevalent among severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients and is a predictor of mortality. The pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is unclear. Early reports of histopathologic examination from autopsied kidney tissue show SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in renal tubular cells and podocytes, suggesting direct viral infection, as well as findings of acute tubular necrosis, while rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI and glomerulopathies may also occur. As of today, only remdesivir has been authorized to treat COVID-19. Ongoing research investigates potential of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents along with safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed drugs such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers. This review discusses the prevalence of AKI and its association with outcome, while highlighting possible mechanisms of AKI and suggesting organ protective measures to prevent the development of kidney damage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have tried to evaluate the real efficacy of school closure for pandemic control over time, no definitive answer to this question has been given. Moreover, it has not been clarified whether children or teenagers could be considered a problem for SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or, on the contrary, whether parents and school workers play a greater role. The aims of this review are to discuss about children's safety at school and the better strategies currently able to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at school. MAIN AIM: Compared to adults, very few cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in children, who generally suffered from an asymptomatic infection or a mild disease. Moreover, school closure is systematically associated with the development of problems involving students, teachers and parents, particularly among populations with poor resources. Although several researches have tried to evaluate the real efficacy of school closure for pandemic control over time, no definitive answer to this question has been given. Available findings seem to confirm that to ensure adequate learning and to avoid social and economic problems, schools must remain open, provided that the adults who follow children at home and at school absolutely comply with recommendations for prevention measures and that school facilities can be optimized in order to significantly reduce the spread of infection. In this regard, the universal use of face masks in addition to hand hygiene and safe distancing in schools, at least starting from the age of 6 years, seems extremely useful. Moreover, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak the use of telemedicine to manage suspected SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in the community has appeared to be an easy and effective measure to solve many paediatric problems and could represent a further support to schools . CONCLUSIONS: We think that schools must remain open, despite COVID-19 pandemic. However, several problems strictly related to school frequency and reduction of infectious risk must be solved before school attendance can be considered completely safe. A single more in-depth guideline agreed between countries with the same school problems could be very useful in eliminating doubts and fostering the compliance of students, teachers and non-teaching school staff reducing errors and misinterpretations.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems across the world. To date, there has been little application of a race, migration and gender lens to explore the long-term health and social consequences of COVID-19 in African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities in Canada, who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. The evidence presented in this commentary suggests that recovery strategies need to adopt an intersectional lens taking into account race, migration and gender since ACB women and ACB immigrant women have been among the populations most impacted both personally and economically. To do so, there is an urgent need to incorporate variables capturing race, beyond "visible minority" status; gender, beyond looking at differences between women and men; and factors to help understand the complexities of migration trajectories (i.e., beyond the dichotomy of born in Canada versus not born in Canada categories) in Canadian datasets. We provide examples of policy and practice initiatives that will be urgently required to address the needs of these population groups as these race-based data become available.

AB  - The knowledge on the deposition and retention of the viral particle of SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract during the very initial intake from the ambient air is of prime importance to understand the infectious process and COVID-19 initial symptoms. We propose to use a modified version of a widely tested lung deposition model developed by the ICRP, in the context of the ICRP Publication 66, that provides deposition patterns of microparticles in different lung compartments. In the model, we mimicked the "environmental decay" of the virus, determined by controlled experiments related to normal speeches, by the radionuclide 11C that presents comparable decay rates. Our results confirm clinical observations on the high virus retentions observed in the extrathoracic region and the lesser fraction on the alveolar section (in the order of 5), which may shed light on physiopathology of clinical events as well on the minimal inoculum required to establish infection.

AB  - The novel post SARS-COV2 Paediatric Inflammatory Syndrome, first recognised in April 2020, took worldwide clinicians by surprise. There rapidly followed a plethora of case definitions, nomenclatures, descriptive papers, and guidelines on treatment. There has been controversy around this condition. Is it really new? Is it an atypical form of a known disease? How should we communicate and report such cases? What is the pathogenesis? Which treatments are given, and which are effective? What are the short and long-term outcomes? We are all learning fast. The clinical and immunological patterns seen are unique. There are significant differences in both presentation and pathogenesis to any known condition, including Kawasaki's disease. This implies that treatments are not necessarily transferrable: and indeed it is unknown which treatments are effective at all. Outcomes, as far as are known, are good, but long term data is lacking. The international cooperation has been an example of how today's connected medicine can be a force for good, however calm assessment of evidence remains necessary to ensure the best outcomes for our patients. This short article identifies what we have learnt from the first surge of COVID-19 cases about paediatric inflammatory syndrome and how it affects children.

AB  - Research reveals that a "finite pool of worry" constrains concern about and action on climate change. Nevertheless, a longitudinal panel survey of 1,858 UK residents, surveyed in April 2019 and June 2020, reveals little evidence for diminishing climate change concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the sample identifies climate change as a bigger threat than COVID-19. The findings suggest climate change has become an intransigent concern within UK public consciousness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A vaccine trial with a conventional challenge design can be very fast once it starts, but it requires a long prior process, in part, to grow and standardize challenge virus in the laboratory. This detracts somewhat from its overall promise for accelerated efficacy testing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, and from the ability of developing countries and small companies to conduct it. OBJECTIVES: We set out to identify a challenge design that avoids this part of the long prior process. SOURCES: Literature in trial design (including a proof of concept flu challenge trial by B. Killingley et al), vaccinology, medical ethics, and various aspects of COVID response. CONTENT: A challenge design with deliberate natural viral exposure avoids the need to grow culture. This new design is described and compared both to a conventional challenge design and to a conventional phase III field trial. In comparison, the propsed design has ethical, scientific, and feasibility strengths. IMPLICATIONS: The proposed new design should be considered for future vaccine trials.

AB  - Many studies on SARS-CoV-2 have been performed over short-time scale, but few have focused on the ultrastructural characteristics of infected cells. We used TEM to perform kinetic analysis of the ultrastructure of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Early infection events were characterized by the presence of clusters of single-membrane vesicles and stacks of membrane containing nuclear pores called annulate lamellae (AL). A large network of host cell-derived organelles transformed into virus factories was subsequently observed in the cells. As previously described for other RNA viruses, these replication factories consisted of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) located close to the nucleus. Viruses released at the cell surface by exocytosis harbored the typical crown of spike proteins, but viral particles without spikes were also observed in intracellular compartments, possibly reflecting incorrect assembly or a cell degradation process.

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 has led to a pandemic that has caused millions of cases of disease, variable morbidity and hundreds of thousands of deaths. Currently, only remdesivir and dexamethasone have demonstrated limited efficacy, only slightly reducing disease burden, thus novel approaches for clinical management of COVID-19 are needed. We identified a panel of human monoclonal antibody clones from a yeast display library with specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain that neutralized the virus in vitro. Administration of the lead antibody clone to Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced viral load and histopathology score in the lungs. Moreover, the antibody interrupted monocyte infiltration into the lungs, which may have contributed to the reduction of disease severity by limiting immunopathological exacerbation. The use of this antibody could provide an important therapy for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - A new pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide and become pandemic with thousands new deaths and infected cases globally. To address coronavirus disease (COVID-19), currently no effective drug or vaccine is available. This necessity motivated us to explore potential lead compounds by considering drug repurposing approach targeting main protease (Mpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. This enzyme considered to be an attractive drug target as it contributes significantly in mediating viral replication and transcription. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. The structure-based pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the co-crystallized structure of the enzyme with its biological active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied for virtual screening based PhaseScore. Docking based virtual screening workflow was used to generate hit compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based Glide GScore. The pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the selected lead compounds were characterized using ADMET. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the binding affinities of the considered lead compounds. Binding energies revealed that compound ABBV-744 binds to the Mpro with strong affinity (ΔGbind -45.43 kcal/mol), and the complex is more stable in comparison with other protein-ligand complexes. Our study classified three best compounds which could be considered as promising inhibitors against main protease SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - In December 2019, the latest member of the coronavirus family, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, leading to the outbreak of an unusual viral pneumonia known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 was then declared as a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). The initial mortality rate of COVID-19 declared by WHO was 2%; however, this rate has increased to 3.4% as of 3 March 2020. People of all ages can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but those aged 60 or above and those with underlying medical conditions are more prone to develop severe symptoms that may lead to death. Patients with severe infection usually experience a hyper pro-inflammatory immune reaction (i.e., cytokine storm) causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has been shown to be the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. However, the factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, resistance and severity remain poorly understood. In this review, we thoroughly explore the correlation between various host, viral and environmental markers, and SARS-CoV-2 in terms of susceptibility and severity.

AB  - It is no longer news that a novel strain of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is ravaging the health sector worldwide, several attempts have been made to curtail this pandemic via repurposing of old drugs but at the present, available drugs are not adequately effective. Over the years, plant phytochemicals are increasingly becoming alternative sources of antimicrobial agents with novel mechanisms of action and limited side effects compared to synthetic drugs. Isolated saponins and tannins were evaluated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) via Molecular Docking and it was observed that a handsome number of the phytochemicals had binding affinities much better than Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, and N3 inhibitor which were used as the standards in this study. Further investigation of drug-likeness, ADMET profile, PASS profile, oral bioavailability, bioactivity, binding mode, and molecular interactions of these phytochemicals revealed that binding affinity alone is not enough to justify the potency of a molecule in the drug discovery process, as only 4 among the screened compounds passed all the analyses and are identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro). This preliminary study thereby recommends Ellagic acid (- 8.4 kcal/mol), Arjunic Acid (- 8.1 kcal/mol), Theasapogenol B (- 8.1 kcal/mol), and Euscaphic Acid (- 8.0 kcal/mol) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) with better pharmacokinetics and bioavailability compared to Remdesivir which is currently used compassionately.

AB  - Background: Syncope is not a common manifestation of COVID-19, but it may occur in this context and it can be the presenting symptom in some cases. Although several mechanisms may explain the pathophysiology behind COVID-19 related syncope, a valid relationship has not been established yet. In this systematic review, we aimed to examine the current incidence of syncope in COVID-19 patients and to explore different patterns observed in this setting. Methods: A systematic review across PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS was performed, according to PRISMA guidelines, in order to identify all relevant articles regarding both COVID-19 and syncope. Results: We identified 81 publications, of which 62 were excluded. The cumulative incidence of syncope and pre-syncope across the selected studies was 7.1% (256/3584 patients). Unspecified syncope was the most common type (76.2% of the reported episodes), followed by reflex syncope (18.1% of the cases). Orthostatic hypotension was responsible for 3.6% of the cases and syncope of presumable cardiac cause accounted for 2.0%. Arterial hypertension was present in 64.7% of the patients and either angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used by 39.5% of hypertensive patients with syncope. Conclusion: Syncope, although not considered a typical symptom of the COVID-19 disease, can be associated with it, particularly in early stages. Different types of syncope were seen in this context, each with different implications requiring distinct approaches. A careful reevaluation of blood pressure whenever a patient develops COVID-19 is suggested, including reassessment of antihypertensive therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding receivedAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No ethics committee approval is needed for systematic reviewsAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The variant seems to have been circulating for over two years, but its sequence has not been documented in that period. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in changes in health-seeking behavior and overwhelmed pathogen diagnostics, our findings highlight the importance of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE ) as an early warning system for virus surveillance.

AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate and monitor the mental health status of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The meta-analysis was used to study the literatures on the psychology of pregnant women in four databases until Sep 27, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 19 articles were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of anxiety was 42 % (95 %CI 26 %-57 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 99.6 %). The overall prevalence of depression was 25 % (95 %CI 20 %-31 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 97.9 %). Age, family economic status, social support, and physical activity seem to correlate with the mental health status of pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pregnant women are more concerned about others than themselves during COVID-19, and younger pregnant women seem to be more prone to anxiety, while social support and physical activity can reduce the likelihood of anxiety and depression. It is necessary to take some psychological intervention measures for pregnant women to help them go through this special period safely and smoothly.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, causing the lethal disease COVid-19, is a public health emergency in the 2020 global pandemic. The outbreak and fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 have a high morbidity and mortality specifically in elder patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and organ transplanted patients with immunosuppressive therapy. Preliminary results support different treatments such as chloroquine and convalescent plasma infusion in severe cases, with good outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplementation with active vitamin D, an immunomodulator hormone with antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects, is unproven. A recent study reported that vitamin D attains antiviral effects, via blocking viral replication directly. SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the immune evasion process during infection via the envelope spike glycoprotein, which is followed by a cytokine storm, causing severe acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2, by using the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by the protein spike, as the host receptor to enter into alveolar, myocardial, and renal epithelial cells, can be disrupted by vitamin D. However, the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths in previous studies was insignificant. Retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find this correlation. Studies have shown that, vitamin D reduces the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia via direct inhibition of viral replication, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The data available today regarding the beneficial protective effect of vitamin D is unclear and with conflicting results. Large randomized control trials are necessary to test this hypothesis. In this review, we will explain the cross talk between the active vitamin D and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and summarize the data from the literature.

AB  - Many governments have seen digital health technologies as promising tools to tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic. A much-talked example in this context involves the recent deluge of digital contact tracing apps (DCT) aimed at detecting Covid-19 exposure. In this short contribution we look at the bio-political justification of this phenomenon and reflect on whether DCT apps constitute, as it is often argued, a serious potential breach of our right to privacy. Despite praising efforts attempting to develop legal and ethical frameworks for DCT apps' usage; we argue that such endeavours are not sufficient to tackle the more fundamental problem of mass surveillance, which will remain largely unaddressed unless we deal with the biopolitical arguments presented and resort to a technical and structural defence.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerges as current outbreak cause by Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This infection affects respiratory system and provides uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response as cytokine storm. The main concern about SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is high viral pathogenicity with no specific drugs. MicroRNAs (miRs) as small non-coding RNAs (21-25 nt) regulate gene expression. The SARS-CoV-2 encoded-miRs affect human genes that involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis, immune response and inflammation. Also, they alter self-gene regulation and hijacked host miRs that provide protective environment to maintain its latency. On the other hand, Host miRs play critical role in viral gene expression to restrict infection. Over expression/inhibition of miRs might result in cell cycle irregularity, impaired immune response or cancer. In this manner, exact role of each miR should be specified. Mimic encoded-miRs like antagomirs showed successful result in phases of clinical trial prevent from negative effects of viral encoded-miRs. Products of mimic miRs are inexpensive corresponds to synthesis of primer; they are short and nanoscale in size. Although SARS-CoV-2 genome is undergoing evaluation, detection of exact molecular pathogenesis open up opportunities to for vaccine development. Salivaomics can evaluate SARS-CoV-2 genome, transcriptome, proteome and biomarkers like miRs in oral related and cancer disease. In this review, we studied the challenge and opportunities of miRs in therapeutic approach for SARS-CoV-2 infection, then overviewed the role of miRs in saliva droplet during SARS-CoV-2 infection and related cancer.

Covid-19 is a major illness, presently there is no as such any medicine and vaccine those can claim for complete treatment. It is spreading particularly in a feeble immune people and casualties are expanding abruptly and put the health system under strain. Among the strategic measures face mask is one of the most used measures to prevent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Wearing a face mask possibly create a false sense of security lead to decline others measures. Face mask could be risk for the people of under lying medical conditions, old age group, outdoor exercise, acute and chronic respiratory disorders and feeble innate immune. Restrictive airflow due to face mask is the main cause of retention of CO2 called hypercapnia that can lead to respiratory failure with symptoms of tachycardia, flushed skin, dizziness, papilledema, seizure and depression. According to latest updates face shield and social distancing could be better substitute of face mask.

AB  - AIM: The current world has changed in all shapes since the emergence of the novel coronavirus (nCoV-2) also known as COVID-19. Among the extra-pulmonary manifestations of nCoV-2, ophthalmic symptoms have less been systematically studied. The so far existing body of evidence indicates that nCoV-2 has the potential to affect both anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Albeit, the exact mechanisms which underlie ophthalmic manifestations of nCoV-2 are yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The present brief review is an attempt to put together and highlight the significant yet limited number of studies which have spotlighted ophthalmic issues in nCoV-2 patients using a systematic literature search strategy. RESULTS: All case series or reports (including both published and preprint articles) which described ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and/or documented testing of SARS-COV-2 in ocular secretions via various sampling or detection methods were sought to be included. CONCLUSION: The ophthalmic presentations in SARS-COV-2 are often found to be salient. Raising awareness in this respect may help defining evidencebased protective measures in today's practice of ophthalmology and allied disciplines.

AB  - Masks constructed of a variety of materials are in widespread use due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and people are exposed to chemicals inherent in the masks through inhalation. This work aims to survey commonly available mask materials to provide an overview of potential exposure. A total of 19 mask materials were analyzed using a nontargeted analysis two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC)-mass spectrometric (MS) workflow. Traditionally, there has been a lack of GCxGC-MS automated high-throughput screening methods, resulting in trade-offs with throughput and thoroughness. This work addresses the gap by introducing new machine learning software tools for high-throughput screening (Floodlight) and subsequent pattern analysis (Searchlight). A recursive workflow for chemical prioritization suitable for both manual curation and machine learning is introduced as a means of controlling the level of effort and equalizing sample loading while retaining key chemical signatures. Manual curation and machine learning were comparable with the mask materials clustering into three groups. The majority of the chemical signatures could be characterized by chemical class in seven categories: organophosphorus, long chain amides, polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, n-alkanes, olefins, branched alkanes and long-chain organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. The olefin, branched alkane, and organophosphorus components were primary contributors to clustering, with the other chemical classes having a significant degree of heterogeneity within the three clusters. Machine learning provided a means of rapidly extracting the key signatures of interest in agreement with the more traditional time-consuming and tedious manual curation process. Some identified signatures associated with plastics and flame retardants are potential toxins, warranting future study to understand the mask exposure route and potential health effects.

AB  - Objectives: Residents in nursing homes are being isolated to prevent exposure to COVID-19. Many are prone to depression, anxiety and loneliness, and extra isolation leaves them vulnerable to compromised mental health. In this study, trained volunteers providing befriending for residents with symptoms of depression, anxiety and loneliness switched to remote befriending during COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to gauge volunteer perceptions of the switch. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to understand how switching to remote befriending impacted on volunteers and residents. A convenience sample of 18 participants responded to questions either in individual or group interviews. Results: Volunteers adapted their befriending visits, switching from face to face visits to remote options. The format was decided collaboratively. Hearing impairments hindered phone calls. Residents sometimes felt uncomfortable with digital technology but on the whole, the change to remote "visiting" was accepted. Conclusions: Further research is being conducted to gauge mental health outcomes for residents. Most volunteers and residents accepted the switch to remote befriending as better than no contact. Clinical implications: Volunteers can provide valuable support for residents living with social isolation during COVID-19. The format for social support needs to be decided collaboratively between volunteer and resident.

AB  - Background : Heart failure patient management guided by invasive intra-cardiac and pulmonary pressure measurements through permanent intra-cardiac micro-sensors has recently been published as a strategy to individualize the therapy of patients with chronic heart failure to reduce re-hospitalization and optimize quality of life. Furthermore, the use of telemedicine could have an important impact on infective disease spread during the current coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. Case summary : Emergent hospitalization of a patient with acute on chronic heart failure, who is currently in self-isolation as a result of his comorbid profile that exposes him to high risk for severe course and mortality in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was prevented using a last generation telemedicine tool. Discussion : Further implementation of invasive telemedicine could prevent hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure and consecutive exposure to a potential hospital infection with SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk patients.

AB  - Coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic disease declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). This disease reports a high risk of contagion, especially by the transmission of aerosols in health care workers. In this scenario, aerosol exposure is increased in various procedures related to the airway, lungs, and pleural space. For this reason, it is important to have recommendations that reduce the risk of exposure and infection with COVID-19. In this document, a team of international specialists in interventional pulmonology elaborated a series of recommendations, based on the available evidence to define the risk stratification, diagnostic methods and technical considerations on procedures such as bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, and pleural procedures among others. As well as the precautions to reduce the risk of contagion when carrying out pulmonary interventions.

AB  - (1) Background: Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is currently recognized as one of the geriatric syndromes due to its high frequency in older people and its associated complications, which have a direct impact on quality of life. The main objective is to determine the effectiveness of telehealth consultation for the re-evaluation of nutritional status and quality of life assessment in older people diagnosed with OD associated with active use of thickeners to prevent hospital admissions in a COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Methods: an observational, descriptive, and longitudinal study that included a sample of 33 subjects with age equal or superior to 65 years diagnosed with OD with conserved cognitive capacity. The nutritional status was evaluated through the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) questionnaire and biochemical parameters and, the quality of life was determined through the Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire. (3) Results: Thirty-three older patients with OD were recruited (54.5% women), with a mean age of 83.5 ± 7.6 years. The main cause of OD in the study population was neurodegenerative disease (51.5%), followed by cerebrovascular disease (33.3%), and other causes (15.2%). Sixty point six percent of patients were found to be at risk of malnutrition. The MNA score was significantly correlated to albumin (r: 0.600, p < 0.001) and total proteins (r: 0.435, p = 0.015), but not to total cholesterol (r: -0.116, p = 0.534) or lymphocytes (r: -0.056, p = 0.758). The mean total score of the SWAL-QOL was 75.1 ± 16.4 points. (4) Conclusions: the quality of life of the subjects related to the use of a thickener is good. Although the body mass index (BMI) and average biochemical, nutritional parameters of the subjects are within the range of normality, the MNA has detected a high percentage of subjects with the risk of malnutrition, which suggests the need for continuous re-evaluation in these patients, demonstrating the viability of the telematic route in this research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community health workers (CHWs) are well-positioned to play a pivotal role in fighting the pandemic at the community level. The Covid-19 outbreak has led to a lot of stress and anxiety among CHWs as they are expected to perform pandemic related tasks along with the delivery of essential healthcare services. In addition, movement restrictions, lockdowns, social distancing, and lack of protective gear have significantly affected CHWs' routine workflow and performance. To optimize CHWs' functioning, there is a renewed interest in supporting CHWs with digital technology to ensure an appropriate pandemic response. DISCUSSION: The current situation has necessitated the use of digital tools for the delivery of Covid-19 related tasks and other essential healthcare services at the community level. Evidence suggests that there has been a significant digital transformation to support CHWs in these critical times such as remote data collection and health assessments, the use of short message service and voice message for health education, use of digital megaphones for encouraging behavior change, and digital contract tracing. A few LMICs such as Uganda and Ethiopia have been successful in operationalizing digital tools to optimize CHWs' functioning for Covid-19 tasks and other essential health services. CONCLUSION: Yet, in most LMICs, there are some challenges concerning the feasibility and acceptability of using digital tools for CHWs during the Covid-19 pandemic. In most cases, CHWs find it difficult to adopt and use digital health solutions due to lack of training on new digital tools, weak technical support, issues of internet connectivity, and other administrative related challenges. To address these challenges, engaging governments would be essential for training CHWs on user-friendly digital health solutions to improve routine workflow of CHWs during the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Since March 2020, the world has been fighting a global pandemic caused by a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, an airway disease that can be severe and fatal in a percentage of cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop extrapulmonary lesions, with renal, hepatic, cardiac, neurological, and tissue involvement that can cause further severe complications. On December 21, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the marketing of the first COVID-19 vaccine. However, several randomized trials are ongoing to find effective, safe, and widely available treatments. The most severe stages of COVID-19 infection are characterized by a multi-system inflammatory state induced by a cytokine storm causing multi-organ injury. Epidemiologic evidence has shown that glucocorticoids (GCs), particularly dexamethasone, are used in severe, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with good therapeutic benefit. COVID-19 can also damage the endothelial system, causing microcirculatory disturbances and consequently leading to functional organ disorders. The combination of endothelial dysfunction with a generalized inflammatory state may contribute to the general pro-coagulative state described in patients with COVID-19 with increased risk of venous and arterial occlusions. The aim of this article is to describe the therapeutic utility of GCs in stabilizing the vascular endothelial barrier in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, we believe that the stabilization of the endothelial barrier and the anti-inflammatory effect of GCs could be the main effect underlying the therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted community mental health center (CMHC) operations by limiting in-person access to patients and contributing to staff absenteeism. States adjust social distancing levels over time in response to changes in economic needs, healthcare system utilization, and COVID-19 virus transmission levels. Community mental health centers also need to balance service needs with infection risk, which requires adjusting social distancing levels in response to changes in the local conditions. This article will: (1) briefly describe epidemiological indicators most useful for judging the local infection trends, (2) describe a strategy for organizing specific agency clinical functions on a social distancing level scale, (3) propose a set of agency phases to inform administrative responses to changes in the risk to operations, and (4) discuss the role of psychiatrists as physicians in a mental health agency during a pandemic.

AB  - Using Galileo theory and method of multidimensional scaling (MDS), we compared the psychological distances between concepts related to two pandemic viruses, Zika and COVID-19. Surveys (Zika, N = 410; COVID-19, N = 291) were used to investigate the role of media use and interpersonal communication on the relationship between 10 concepts in multidimensional spaces. We asked these four research questions: Do the two spaces represent the two pandemics similarly? What is the relationship of me and of people to each pandemic? What is the effect of virus-related media use and interpersonal talk on the pandemic space? What are optimal messages for moving me closer to Zika and to COVID-19? Media use influenced the distances for both pandemics: With greater media use, the concepts were closer in the Zika space and further apart in the COVID-19 space. Interpersonal communication was associated with few differences in the spaces. Based on the psychological distances between concepts, optimal messages were identified: For Zika, a message with two concepts, people and women, is predicted to be most effective to move Zika to the concept me, whereas for COVID-19, a message with people is predicted to be most effective to move COVID-19 to me.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, rapidly reaching global pandemic proportions. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unique challenges to the rheumatology community. It is known that many individuals with rheumatic disease are at increased risk of severe disease from other infections, sparking a similar fear for COVID-19. In addition, medications routinely used in rheumatology practice are being trialled as treatments, with the potential for drug shortages for rheumatology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Underlying comorbidities and active disease are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. Tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine have not proven to be effective treatments in the management of COVID-19. Telehealth has become an essential tool for the rheumatology community to monitor patients during the pandemic. In this article, we summarise the available COVID-19 evidence that is of relevance to the rheumatology community. We discuss the risk of contracting COVID-19 in individuals with rheumatic disease, along with presenting features and clinical outcomes. We provide an overview of the treatments for COVID-19 which have significance for rheumatology. We highlight published recommendations which can guide our management of rheumatic disease populations during this pandemic. Finally, we discuss the challenges in delivering effective care virtually and present methods and tools which could be adapted for use.

AB  - In this article, we investigate the surge in use of COVID-19-related preprints by media outlets. Journalists are a main source of reliable public health information during crises and, until recently, journalists have been reluctant to cover preprints because of the associated scientific uncertainty. Yet, uploads of COVID-19 preprints and their uptake by online media have outstripped that of preprints about any other topic. Using an innovative approach combining altmetrics methods with content analysis, we identified a diversity of outlets covering COVID-19-related preprints during the early months of the pandemic, including specialist medical news outlets, traditional news media outlets, and aggregators. We found a ubiquity of hyperlinks as citations and a multiplicity of framing devices for highlighting the scientific uncertainty associated with COVID-19 preprints. These devices were rarely used consistently (e.g., mentioning that the study was a preprint, unreviewed, preliminary, and/or in need of verification). Less than half of the stories we analyzed contained framing devices emphasizing uncertainty. Outlets in our sample were much less likely to identify the research they mentioned as preprint research, compared to identifying it as simply "research." This work has significant implications for public health communication within the changing media landscape. While current best practices in public health risk communication promote identifying and promoting trustworthy sources of information, the uptake of preprint research by online media presents new challenges. At the same time, it provides new opportunities for fostering greater awareness of the scientific uncertainty associated with health research findings.

AB  - The cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm, which is the hyper-induction of inflammatory responses has a central role in the mortality rate of COVID-19 and some other viral infections. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key player in the development of cytokine storms. Shedding of interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6Rα) results in the accumulation of soluble interleukin-6 receptors (sIL-6R). Only relatively few cells express membrane-bound IL-6Rα. However, sIL-6R can act on potentially all cells and organs through the ubiquitously expressed gp130, the coreceptor of IL-6Rα. Through this, so-called trans-signaling, IL-6-sIL-6R is a powerful factor in the development of cytokine storms and multiorgan involvement. Some bacteria (e.g., Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes), commonly considered to cause co-infections during viral pneumonia, can directly induce the shedding of membrane receptors, including IL-6Rα, or enhance endogenous shedding mechanisms causing the increase of sIL-6R level. Here we hypothesise that bacteria promoting shedding and increase the sIL-6R level can be an important contributing factor for the development of cytokine storms. Therefore, inhibition of IL-6Rα shedding by drastically reducing the number of relevant bacteria may be a critical element in reducing the chance of a cytokine storm. Validation of this hypothesis can support the consideration of the prophylactic use of antibiotics more widely and at an earlier stage of infection to decrease the mortality rate of COVID-19.

AB  - Scientific research is essential for a nation's development and is vital for generating solutions to population's health. Individual country's capacities to prevent and respond to public health issues, including health crises, is built with long-term investment in highly qualified professionals, infrastructure, and uninterrupted operating funding. Most Latin American countries, especially those at the bottom of the human development list, have limited capacity even though they are hot spots for tropical and other emerging infectious diseases. This weakness deepens these countries' dependence on nations with higher development and corresponding scientific capacity. The current COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the health of the world's population and the global economy. Countries that lagged behind prior to the pandemic now face a myriad of additional challenges. On a more optimistic note, the pandemic could serve as a wake-up call for governments and funding agencies to strengthen scientific capacity around the world, so that we are better prepared to address the public health issues caused by current and prevalent diseases and by future diseases of pandemic potential.

AB  - Quantitative measurements of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in raw wastewater have been implemented worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic. Recent efforts are being made to evaluate different viral concentration methodologies to overcome supplier shortages during lockdowns. A set of 22-wastewater samples seeded with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, and the bacteriophage MS2, were used to characterize and compare two ultrafiltration-based methods: a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Centricon® Plus-70) and the automated concentrating pipette CP-Select™. Based on the recovery efficiencies, significant differences were observed for MHV, with Centricon® Plus-70 (24%) being the most efficient method. Nevertheless, concentrations of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2, Human adenoviruses and JC polyomaviruses in these samples did not result in significant differences between methods suggesting that testing naturally occurring viruses may complement the evaluation of viral concentration methodologies. Based on the virus adsorption to solids and the necessity of a pre-centrifugation step to remove larger particles and avoid clogging when using ultrafiltration methods, we assessed the percentage of viruses not quantified after ultrafiltration. Around 23% of the detected SARS-CoV-2 would be discarded during the debris removal step. The CP-Select™ provided the highest concentration factor (up to 333×) and the lowest LoD (6.19 × 103 GC/l) for MHV and proved to be fast, automatic, highly reproducible and suitable to work under BSL-2 measures.

AB  - The rapid development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a global priority. Here, we develop two capsid-like particle (CLP)-based vaccines displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RBD antigens are displayed on AP205 CLPs through a split-protein Tag/Catcher, ensuring unidirectional and high-density display of RBD. Both soluble recombinant RBD and RBD displayed on CLPs bind the ACE2 receptor with nanomolar affinity. Mice are vaccinated with soluble RBD or CLP-displayed RBD, formulated in Squalene-Water-Emulsion. The RBD-CLP vaccines induce higher levels of serum anti-spike antibodies than the soluble RBD vaccines. Remarkably, one injection with our lead RBD-CLP vaccine in mice elicits virus neutralization antibody titers comparable to those found in patients that had recovered from COVID-19. Following booster vaccinations, the virus neutralization titers exceed those measured after natural infection, at serum dilutions above 1:10,000. Thus, the RBD-CLP vaccine is a highly promising candidate for preventing COVID-19.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. This virus has led to 61.8 million cases worldwide being reported as of December 1st, 2020. Currently, there are no definite approved therapies endorsed by the World Health Organization for COVID-19, focusing only on supportive care. Treatment centers around symptom management, including oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation. Immunotherapy has the potential to play a role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in particular, is a relatively new approach in the world of infectious diseases and has the benefit of overcoming challenges with serum therapy and intravenous immunoglobulins preparations. Here, we reviewed the articles published in PubMed with the purpose of summarizing the currently available evidence for the use of neutralizing antibodies as a potential treatment for coronaviruses. Studies reporting in vivo results were summarized and analyzed. Despite promising data from some studies, none of them progressed to clinical trials. It is expected that neutralizing antibodies might offer an alternative for COVID-19 treatment. Thus, there is a need for randomized trials to understand the potential use of this treatment.

AB  - Immunization with an inactivated virus is one of the strategies currently being tested towards developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. While gamma (γ) rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modeled the effect of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. Our findings showed that γ rays produced significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induced less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope was sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family-centered care contributes to improved outcomes for preterm and ill infants. Little is known about the perceptions of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) healthcare professionals regarding the degree to which their NICU practices or values family-centered care. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to describe attitudes and beliefs of NICU healthcare professionals about family-centered care and to explore professional characteristics that might influence those views. METHODS: Data were derived from the baseline phase of a multicenter quasi-experimental study comparing usual family-centered NICU care with mobile-enhanced family-integrated care. Neonatal intensive care unit healthcare professionals completed the Family-Centered Care Questionnaire-Revised (FCCQ-R), a 45-item measure of 9 core dimensions of Current Practice and Necessary Practice for family-centered care. RESULTS: A total of 382 (43%) NICU healthcare professionals from 6 NICUs completed 1 or more of the FCCQ-R subscales, 83% were registered nurses. Total and subscale scores on the Necessary Practice scale were consistently higher than those on the Current Practice scale for all dimensions of family-centered care (mean: 4.40 [0.46] vs 3.61 [0.53], P < .001). Only years of hospital experience and NICU site were significantly associated with Current Practice and Necessary Practice total scores. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Ongoing assessment of the perceptions of NICU healthcare professionals regarding their current practice and beliefs about what is necessary for the delivery of high-quality family-centered care can inform NICU education, quality improvement, and maintenance of family-centered care during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research is needed to identify additional factors that predict family-centered care perceptions and behaviors.

AB  - At the end of 2019, in Wuhan, the Hubei Province's capital city in China, the first cases of COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were described. The rapid spread of the infection through the world resulted in the World Health Organization announcing the COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020. The main routes of transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, according to current evidence, are via droplets inhalation, direct contact with contaminated surfaces, and transmission via the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes, and probably through airborne particles from the respiratory tract, generated during coughing and sneezing of infected individuals. During the pulmonary function testing (PFTs), which require strenuous breathing maneuvers and generate high-intensity airflow, aerosols, and micro-aerosols are formed from respiratory secretions and may contain viral and bacterial particles. Therefore, such forced respiratory maneuvers pose a significant risk of spreading the infection to patients and laboratory staff. According to current knowledge, the source of infection may also be an asymptomatic and a pre-symptomatic individual. Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly prevalent in the community, and this increases a potential risk to all patients tested lung function and staff working there. As the patients' and staff's safety is of unprecedented importance, the additional precautions when performing pulmonary function tests are necessary and unquestionable. In consequence, the greater availability of consumables and personal protective equipment is indispensable. The reorganization of daily practice will prolong test time, reduce the number of tests performed, and slow down patients' flow. The guidance provides practical advice to health care professionals on performing pulmonary function tests during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been developed basing on currently available information and recommendations from relevant health care institutions. As the COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation and the new scientific data has been becoming are available, the guidance will be updated over time.

AB  - We investigate why some communities experience worse COVID-19 outcomes than others. Past studies have linked the resilience of communities against crisis to social vulnerability and the capacity of local governments to provide public goods and services like health care. Disaster studies, which frequently examine the effect of social ties and mobility, may better help illuminate the current spread of COVID-19. We analyze Japan's 47 prefectures from February 12 to August 31 using 62,722 individual confirmed cases of COVID-19, paired with daily tallies of aggregate Facebook user movement among neighborhoods. Controlling for mobility levels, health care systems, government finance, gender balance, age, income, and education levels of communities, our analysis indicates that areas with strong linking social ties see no or far lower levels of COVID-19 case rates initially. However, case fatality rates rise in such communities once the disease enters as they lack horizontal (bonding) ties which can mitigate its health impacts. We anticipate this study to be a starting point for broader studies of how social ties and mobility influence COVID-19 outcomes worldwide along with shining a light on how different types of social relationships play different roles as a crisis or disaster progresses.

AB  - The right to the highest attainable standard of health, existing under a number of international human rights instruments, including Art 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, has been incorporated in local law and in the constitutions of many countries. An important body of jurisprudence interpreting such rights and applying them in particular factual health scenarios is developing. Against the background of the South African Constitutional Court's 2002 landmark decision in Minister of Health v Treatment Action Campaign (No 2) (2002) 5 SA 721 in relation to access to HIV medications, this editorial reviews significant decisions in 2012 by Ngugi J of the Kenya High Court in PAO v Attorney General [2012] eKLR and by the Uganda Constitutional Court in 2020 in Center for Health, Human Rights and Development v Attorney General [2020] UGCC 12. It contends that this combination of high-profile judgments has breathed substance and significance into the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the entitlement to be treated with dignity and the right to life at a time when these rights may assume additional importance in the context of the availability and accessibility of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus.

AB  - The imperatives generated by the need for research into efficacious forms of treatment for COVID-19 have shone a fresh light upon the criteria for inclusion in clinical trials of persons unable to provide informed consent by reason of a number of factors including the seriousness of their illness symptomatology. This column identifies diversity in European, United States and Australian legislative and other guidance on the ethical issues that arise in respect of clinical research to which participants are not able to consent. It reviews the decision-making by the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal in a 2020 case in which permission was sought to conduct a clinical trial into a drug, STC 3141, designed by researchers as a potential treatment for patients with Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome arising from COVID-19. It outlines the reasoning of the Tribunal in the context of debates about the balance to be struck between clinically useful medication trials and the need to avoid exploitation of vulnerable persons not able to provide their own consent, be that by virtue of disabilities such as acuteness of illness or dementia symptomatology. It contends that the decision illustrates the potential for research to be undertaken safely and ethically, utilising subjects in an intensive care unit who are unable to provide consent.

AB  - Historically and etymologically, curfews are public health measures imposed to guard against risks to health and safety. On occasion they have been deployed oppressively, disproportionately and without proper regard to their ramifications. It is important that they not be used during a pandemic unless there is sufficient medico-scientific reason to conclude that they will serve a constructive purpose and that they are the least restrictive available governmental response. Inevitably, they impact adversely on a variety of human rights, particularly freedom of movement. They isolate and inhibit human connection. However, in the context of a worldwide pandemic causing terrible loss of life, there are occasions where they may be a necessary adjunct to these restrictions. This article identifies a variety of scenarios in which curfews have been imposed on different populations and identifies legal challenges that have been made to them. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it reviews the Kenyan judgment of Law Society of Kenya v Mutyambai [2020] eKLR and the Victorian Supreme Court judgment of Loielo v Giles [2020] VSC 722. It contends that the carefully reasoned decisions in each instance constitute an important reassurance that decision-making about a lengthy curfew in order to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus was reasoned, rights-aware and suitably responsive to the risks posed.

AB  - Community transmission of severe acute respiratory illness Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Arizona was noted in March 2020. It was our hypothesis that the associated implementation of physical distancing and masking led to a decline in circulation and detection of common respiratory viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs processed with the Biofire, Film Array respiratory panel at Mayo Clinic Arizona were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020. A total of 13,324 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed. Between April and July 2017- 2019 (Period A) a mean of 262 tests were performed monthly, falling to 128 for the corresponding months of 2020 (Period B). A reduction in the monthly mean number of positive tests (Period A 71.5; Period B 2.8) and mean positivity rate (Period A 25.04%; Period B 2.07%) was observed. Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most prevalent virus, with a monthly mean of 21.6 cases (30.2% of positives) for Period A and 2 cases (72.7% of positives) for Period B. Positivity for a second virus occurred in a mean of 2.1 positive tests (3.3%) in Period A but was absent in Period B. Implementation of distancing and masking coincides with a marked reduction in respiratory virus detection and likely circulation. Data from the fall/winter of 2020 will help clarify the potential role for distancing and masking as a mitigation strategy, not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also in the seasonal battle against common respiratory viruses.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is having a major impact on healthcare systems worldwide. Several months after the COVID-19 outbreak, waiting lists of non-urgent structural heart (SH) interventions continue to increase. Limitations in terms of ICU beds and anesthesiology represent a major limitation to conduct non-urgent SH interventions and are a valid reason to move towards less invasive approaches. The field of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) reflects this challenging situation perfectly. The aim of this paper is to describe the possibilities for pre-procedural LAA assessment, performance of the LAAO procedure and post-procedural surveillance in these challenging times.

AB  - Background: Since its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. It has become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder disease because of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only changed the private life of millions but significantly affected the collaboration of medical specialists throughout healthcare. Hospitals make changes to their regular operations to slow the spread of the virus while ensuring the treatment of emergency patients. These substantial changes affect the typical work setting for clinicians and requires the implementation of organizational arrangements. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim at increasing our understanding of how digital transformation (DT) is pushing virtual collaboration among clinicians in hospitals forward in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We present the lessons learned from an exploratory case study in which we observed the introduction of an IT-system for enhancing collaboration among clinicians in a German hospital. The results are based on 16 semi-structured interviews with physicians from various departments and disciplines which are further generalized for healthcare. RESULTS: Three key lessons and recommendations explain how DT ensures goal-driven collaboration among clinicians. First, we found that a disruptive change requires aligning the mindset of stakeholders. Second, IT enabled collaboration presupposes behavioral rules that must be obeyed. Third, transforming antiquated processes demands a suitable technological infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: DT is pushed forward by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapid introduction of IT-enabled collaboration reveals grievances concerning the digital dissemination of medical information along the patient treatment path. To avoid being caught unprepared by future crises, DT must be further driven to ensure collaboration and requires the diagnostic and therapeutic process to be opened to disruptive strategies. CLINICALTRIAL: None.

AB  - As the pandemic continues, there is increasing hope vaccinations are becoming available. As a solution for a nationwide immunization against the virus, a compulsory vaccination is repeatedly discussed. However, some opponents of vaccination are threatened by the idea of a possible mandatory vaccination. It is therefore necessary to discuss whether such a compulsory vaccination is theoretically legally enforceable. This article discusses the current legal situation in Germany. The introduction of a potential compulsory vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents an encroachment on the fundamental right of physical integrity. According to § 20 (6) IfSG, a protective vaccination for threatened parts of the population is permissible by statutory order, if a transmissible disease with clinically severe courses occurs and its epidemic spread can be expected.

AB  - UNSTRUCTURED: The behavioral health toll of the Covid-19 pandemic and systemic racism has increased attention on the potential of digital health to increases access and quality of behavioral healthcare. However, as the pandemic continues to widen health disparities in racial and ethnic minoritized groups, concerns arise around an increased reliance on digital health technologies exacerbating the digital divide and reinforcing rather than mitigating systemic health inequities in communities of color. As funding for digital mental health continues to surge, we offer five key recommendations on how the field can 'REACT' to ensure the development of approaches that increase health equity through increasing Real-world evidence; Educating consumers and providers; utilizing Adaptive interventions to optimize care; Creating for diverse populations; and building Trust. Recommendations highlight the need to take a strengths-based view to designing for racial and ethnically diverse populations and embracing the potential of digital approaches to address complex challenges.

AB  - The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appearance in Wuhan, China, did rise the new virus disease (COVID-19), which spread globally in a short time, leading the World Health Organization to declare a new global pandemic. To contain and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2, specific public health procedures were implemented in virtually all countries, with a significant impact on society, making it difficult to keep the regular practice of physical activity. It is widely accepted that an active lifestyle contributes to the improvement of general health and preservation of cardiovascular, respiratory, osteo-muscular, and immune system capacities. The positive effects of regular physical activity on the immune system have emerged as a pivotal trigger of general health, underlying the beneficial effects of physical activity on multiple physiological systems. Accordingly, recent studies have already pointed out the negative impact of physical inactivity caused by the social isolation imposed by the public sanitary authorities due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are still no current narrative reviews evaluating the real impact of COVID-19 on active lifestyle or even discussing the possible beneficial effects of exercise-promoted immune upgrade against the severity or progression of COVID-19. Based on the consensus in the scientific literature, in this review, we discuss how an exercise adherence could adequately improve immune responses in times of the "COVID-19 Era and beyond".

AB  - The novel coronavirus outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, China. The local outbreak quickly rose to pandemic level that has spread to more than 188 countries with more than 19 million cases and 732,467 deaths worldwide. The current recommendation for testing is RT-PCR based tests of nasopharyngeal or alternatively nasal- and/or oropharyngeal swabs that detects infection with SARS-CoV-2 to diagnose acute infection. However, there is an urgent need for a quick and accurate antibody-based point-of-care test method to quickly identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who might be missed through active case finding and surveillance efforts. Serology tests measure the presence of antibodies in serum after infection. Here we compared the performance characteristics of 6 commercially available antibody-based point-of-care devices and their potential for identification of individuals infected at some time by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is not sufficient evidence as to whether stool DNA methylation tests allow prioritizing patients to colonoscopy. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a waitlist for rescheduling colonoscopies once the mitigation is lifted. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting colorectal cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE via Ovid were searched. Studies reporting accuracy (Sackett phase 2 or 3) of stool DNA methylation tests to detect sporadic colorectal cancer were included. The DerSimonian-Laird method with random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six studies totaling 16,149 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of all single genes and combinations was 62.7% (57.7%, 67.4%) and 91% (89.5%, 92.2%), respectively. Combinations of genes provided higher sensitivity as compared to single genes [80.8% (75.1%, 85.4%) vs. 57.8% (52.3%, 63.1%)] with no significant decrease in specificity [87.8% (84.1%, 90.7%) vs. 92.1% (90.4%, 93.5%)]. The most accurate single gene was found to be SDC2 with a sensitivity of 83.1% (72.6%, 90.2%) and a specificity of 91.2% (88.6%, 93.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Stool DNA methylation tests have high specificity (92%) with relatively lower sensitivity (81%). Combining genes increases sensitivity as compared to single gene tests. The single most accurate gene is SDC2, which should be considered for further research.

AB  - The return of a Democratic administration to the White House, coupled with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-induced contractions of job-based insurance, may reignite debate over public coverage expansion and its costs. Decades of research demonstrate that uninsured people and people with copays and deductibles use less care than people with first-dollar coverage. Hence, most economic analyses of Medicare for All proposals and other coverage expansions project increased utilization and associated costs. We review the utilization surges that such analyses have predicted and contrast them with the more modest utilization increments observed after past coverage expansions in the US and other affluent nations. The discrepancy between predicted and observed utilization changes suggests that analysts underestimate the role of supply-side constraints-for example, the finite number of physicians and hospital beds. Our review of the utilization effects of past coverage expansions suggests that a first-dollar universal coverage expansion would increase ambulatory visits by 7-10 percent and hospital use by 0-3 percent. Modest administrative savings could offset the costs of such increases.

AB  - In the aftermath of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we revised the cost-effectiveness of the exploited interventions in neonatal intensive care unit, to redefine future strategies for hospital management. Costs were revised with respect to the lockdown R0 or under different R0 scenarios to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the screening program adopted. Weekly nasopharyngeal swabs for parents, neonates, and personnel were the major cost during the pandemic, although they effectively reduced the number of cases in our unit.Conclusion: Parents and healthcare personnel testing appears to be an effective strategy due to the high number of contact they have within the hospital environment and outside, able to minimize the cases within our unit. What is Known: • Costs of universal COVID-19 tests for parents, neonates, and NICU personnel have not been evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic in neonatal intensive care unit in Europe. What is New: • Weekly nasopharyngeal swabs for parents, neonates, and personnel were the major cost during the COVID-19 pandemic in NICU. • Parents and healthcare personnel testing was effective to reduce costs related to COVID-19 due to the high number of contact they have within the hospital environment and outside.

AB  - In December 2019, the novel betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 has since become a pandemic virus resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and deep socioeconomic implications worldwide. In recent months, efforts have been directed towards detecting, tracking, and better understanding human humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has become critical to develop robust and reliable serological assays to characterize the abundance, neutralization efficiency, and duration of antibodies in virus-exposed individuals. Here we review the latest knowledge on humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with the benefits and limitations of currently available commercial and laboratory-based serological assays. We also highlight important serological considerations, such as antibody expression levels, stability and neutralization dynamics, as well as cross-reactivity and possible immunological back-boosting by seasonal coronaviruses. The ability to accurately detect, measure and characterize the various antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for vaccine development, manage risk and exposure for healthcare and at-risk workers, and for monitoring reinfections with genetic variants and new strains of the virus. Having a thorough understanding of the benefits and cautions of standardized serological testing at a community level remains critically important in the design and implementation of future vaccination campaigns, epidemiological models of immunity, and public health measures that rely heavily on up-to-date knowledge of transmission dynamics.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 or covid-19, has caused a pandemic that continues to cause catastrophic health and economic carnage and has escalated the identification and development of antiviral agents. Remdesivir (RDV), a prodrug and requires intracellular conversions to the active triphosphate nucleoside (TN) has surfaced as an active anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. To properly design therapeutic treatment regimens, it is imperative to determine if adequate intracellular TN concentrations are achieved in target tissues, such as the lung. Since measurement of such concentrations is unrealistic in patients, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) model was developed to characterize RDV and TN disposition. Specifically, a hybrid PBPK model was developed based on previously reported data in humans The model represented each tissue as a 2-compartment model - both extracellular and intracellular compartment wherein each intracellular compartment contained a comprehensive metabolic model to the ultimate active metabolite TN. Global sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess which parameters and how highly sensitive ones impacted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNCs) and intracellular lung TN profiles. Finally, clinical multiple-dose regimens indicated that minimum lung intracellular TN concentrations ranged from approximately 9 uM to 4 uM, which suggest current regimens are effective based on in vitro EC50 values. The model can be used to explore tissue drug disposition under various conditions and regimens, and expanded to pharmacodynamic models.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nsP3c (non-structural Protein3c) spans the sequence of the so-called SARS Unique Domains (SUDs), first observed in SARS-CoV. Although the function of this viral protein is not fully elucidated, it is believed that it is crucial for the formation of the replication/transcription viral complex (RTC) and of the interaction of various viral "components" with the host cell; thus, it is essential for the entire viral life cycle. The first two SUDs, the so-called SUD-N (the N-terminal domain) and SUD-M (domain following SUD-N) domains, exhibit topological and conformational features that resemble the nsP3b macro (or "X") domain. Indeed, they are all folded in a three-layer α/β/α sandwich structure, as revealed through crystallographic structural investigation of SARS-CoV SUDs, and they have been attributed to different substrate selectivity as they selectively bind to oligonucleotides. On the other hand, the C-terminal SUD (SUD-C) exhibit much lower sequence similarities compared to the SUD-N & SUD-M, as reported in previous crystallographic and NMR studies of SARS-CoV. In the absence of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2, we report herein the almost complete NMR backbone and side-chain resonance assignment (1H,13C,15N) of SARS-CoV-2 SUD-M and SUD-C proteins, and the NMR chemical shift-based prediction of their secondary structure elements. These NMR data will set the base for further understanding at the atomic-level conformational dynamics of these proteins and will allow the effective screening of a large number of small molecules as binders with potential biological impact on their function.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Germany is experiencing the second COVID-19 pandemic wave. The intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity is an important consideration in the response to the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine the costs and benefits of maintaining or expanding a staffed ICU bed reserve capacity in Germany. METHODS: This study compared the provision of additional capacity to no intervention from a societal perspective. A decision model was developed using, e.g. information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU costs and outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated based upon the willingness to pay for new medicines for the treatment of cancer, a condition with a similar disease burden in the near term. RESULTS: The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) of the last bed added to the existing ICU capacity is €21,958 per life-year gained assuming full bed utilization. The NMB decreases with an additional expansion but remains positive for utilization rates as low as 2%. In a sensitivity analysis, the variables with the highest impact on the MCER were the mortality rates in the ICU and after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates the applicability of cost-effectiveness analysis to policies of hospital pandemic preparedness and response capacity strengthening. In Germany, the provision of a staffed ICU bed reserve capacity appears to be cost-effective even for a low probability of bed utilization.

AB  - Interleukin-38 has recently been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in lung inflammatory diseases. However, the effects of IL-38 in viral pneumonia remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that circulating IL-38 concentrations together with IL-36α increased significantly in influenza and COVID-19 patients, and the level of IL-38 and IL-36α correlated negatively and positively with disease severity and inflammation, respectively. In the co-cultured human respiratory epithelial cells with macrophages to mimic lung microenvironment in vitro, IL-38 was able to alleviate inflammatory responses by inhibiting poly(I:C)-induced overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines through intracellular STAT1, STAT3, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, MEK, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Intriguingly, transcriptomic profiling revealed that IL-38 targeted genes were associated with the host innate immune response to virus. We also found that IL-38 counteracts the biological processes induced by IL-36α in the co-culture. Furthermore, the administration of recombinant IL-38 could mitigate poly I:C-induced lung injury, with reduced early accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, activation of lymphocytes, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and permeability of the alveolar-epithelial barrier. Taken together, our study indicates that IL-38 plays a crucial role in protection from exaggerated pulmonary inflammation during poly(I:C)-induced pneumonia, thereby providing the basis of a novel therapeutic target for respiratory viral infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate whether dental and dental hygiene students' career plans postgraduation were affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine wellness and readiness for clinical practice among students who reported a change in career plans. METHODS: An anonymous online REDCap survey was developed and emailed to 436 dental and dental hygiene students at a US dental school. The survey consisted of 81 questions that covered demographics, career plans postgraduation, and readiness and wellness measures. An open-ended question assessing how students' career plans have changed during the pandemic was also included. RESULTS: A total of 252 students completed the survey, of whom 11.5% reported that their plans for future dental practice have changed since the COVID-19 outbreak. Students who reported a change to their career plans had significantly higher mean perceived stress (20.1 vs. 16.3; P = 0.003) and anxiety (9.2 vs. 6.2; P = 0.004) scores and lower mean resilience (18.9 vs. 20.9; P = 0.01) scores than those who reported no change to their career plans. Concerns were raised regarding the limited employment opportunities, long-term stability of the dental profession, and the interruptions to clinical education and licensure examinations consequent to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive effort inclusive of adeptly designed clinical and curriculum experiences paired with wellness interventions and support tailored to students is needed. These measures need to support trainees across varying years in training and resilience levels to be effective for dental and dental hygiene students as they approach their future career intentions in the dental profession. Additional longitudinal research is needed to assess if change in career intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic corresponds with actual change postpandemic and affects the dental profession. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This study explores the potential short-term change in career intentions of dental hygiene and dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can inform workforce planning as well as interventions developed and implemented by academic dental institutions to support student wellness during unexpected and prolonged emergency situations.

AB  - Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, are urgently needed. We developed two COVID-19 vaccines based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S); their immunogenicity was evaluated in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunizations. Both vaccines induced robust, broad and polyfunctional S-specific CD4+ (mainly Th1) and CD8+ T-cell responses, with a T effector memory phenotype. DNA/MVA immunizations elicited higher T-cell responses. All vaccine regimens triggered high titers of IgG antibodies specific for the S, as well as for the receptor-binding domain; the predominance of the IgG2c isotype was indicative of Th1 immunity. Notably, serum samples from vaccinated mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures, and those from MVA/MVA immunizations showed a higher neutralizing capacity. Remarkably, one or two doses of MVA-CoV2-S protect humanized K18-hACE2 mice from a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, two doses of MVA-CoV2-S confer full inhibition of virus replication in the lungs. These results demonstrate the robust immunogenicity and full efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic.IMPORTANCE The continuous dissemination of the novel emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus, with more than 78 million infected cases worldwide and higher than 1,700,000 deaths as of December 23, 2020, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel vaccines against COVID-19. With this aim, we have developed novel vaccine candidates based on the poxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and we have evaluated their immunogenicity in mice using DNA/MVA or MVA/MVA prime/boost immunization protocols. The results showed the induction of a potent S-specific T-cell response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Remarkably, humanized K18-hACE2 mice immunized with one or two doses of the MVA-based vaccine were 100% protected from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. Moreover, two doses of the vaccine prevented virus replication in lungs. Our findings prove the robust immunogenicity and efficacy of MVA-based COVID-19 vaccines in animal models and support its translation to the clinic.

AB  - We read with interest the study by Hernandez-Camba et al. (1) about the little value found in antibody testing for Covid-19 before endoscopic procedures and we would like to make some comments Nine months after the first state of alarm was declared in Spain due to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, we know that infections in endoscopy staff are scarce if adequate protection is worn and non-urgent procedures are postponed in patients with active infection. Therefore, the conclusions of the study appear to be, currently, self-evident. However, things were different at the time it was done. The study was performed during endoscopic activity resumption, after almost a full stop of most non-urgent endoscopic procedures. Furthemore, at that time, PCR tests on nasopharyngeal exudate were not widely available.

AB  - The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a type I integral membrane that was discovered two decades ago. The ACE2 exists as a transmembrane protein and as a soluble catalytic ectodomain of ACE2, also known as the soluble ACE2 that can be found in plasma and other body fluids. ACE2 regulates the local actions of the renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular tissues, and the ACE2/Angiotensin 1-7 axis exerts protective actions in cardiovascular disease. Increasing soluble ACE2 has been associated with heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and cardiac remodelling. This is a review of the molecular structure and biochemical functions of the ACE2, as well we provided an updated on the evidence, clinical applications, and emerging potential therapies with the ACE2 in heart failure, cardiovascular disease, lung injury, and COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) of the chest plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it should not be used indiscriminately. This review provides indications of CT chest in COVID-19 suspect, positive and recovered patients based on the current scientific evidence and our personal experience. CT chest is not indicated as a routine screening modality due to its poor sensitivity and specificity. However, it is useful in a small subset of COVID-19 suspects who test negative on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with normal/indeterminate chest X-ray (CXR) but have moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms and high index of clinical suspicion. CT chest is not indicated in every RT-PCR-positive patient and should be done only in specific clinical scenarios, where it is expected to significantly contribute in the clinical management such as COVID-19 patients showing unexplained clinical deterioration and/or where other concurrent lung pathology or pulmonary thromboembolism needs exclusion. Serial CXR and point-of-care ultrasound are usually sufficient to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. CT chest is also indicated in COVID-19-positive patients with associated co-morbidities (age> 65 yr, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune-compromise, etc.) who, despite having mild symptoms and normal/indeterminate CXR, record oxygen saturation of < 93 per cent at rest while breathing room air or de-saturate on six-minute walk test. Finally, CT chest plays a crucial role to rule out lung fibrosis in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection who present with hypoxia/impaired lung function on follow up. In conclusion, though CT chest is an indispensable diagnostic tool in COVID-19, it should be used judiciously and only when specifically indicated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and placed tremendous financial pressure on nearly all aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. Diabetes care is an example of the confluence of the pandemic and heightened importance of technology in changing care delivery. It has been estimated the added total direct US medical cost burden due to COVID-19 to range between $160B (20% of the population infected) to $650B (80% of the population infected) over the course of the pandemic. The corresponding range for the population with diabetes is between $16B and $65B, representing between 5% and 20% of overall diabetes expenditure in the US. We examine the evidence to support allocating part of this added spend to infrastructure capabilities to accelerate remote monitoring and management of diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed recent, topical literature and Covid-19-related analyses in the public health, health technology and health economics fields in addition to databases and surveys from government sources and the private sector. We summarized findings on use cases for real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) in the community, for telehealth, and in the hospital setting to highlight the successes and challenges of accelerating the adoption of a digital technology out of necessity during the pandemic and beyond. CONCLUSIONS: One critical and lasting consequence of the pandemic will be the accelerated adoption of digital technology in healthcare delivery. We conclude by discussing ways in which the changes wrought by COVID-19 from a healthcare, policy and economics perspective can add value and are likely to endure post pandemic.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading pandemic, secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The severity and the little knowledge that we have of the disease have made us focus mostly on the respiratory symptoms. As we bend the curve, other findings reported in association with COVID-19 become of importance for specialists to recognize. We describe the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions in the skin that can be the only symptom or the first manifestation of COVID-19 and demonstrate the origin of the virus. We collected 25 patients with skin lesions in this context. We recognized 5 types of cutaneous manifestations including acute acroischemic or chilblain-like lesions (11), purpura palpable (2), exanthemas (9), urticarial eruptions (1), and other lesions (2) that might appear with more unspecific pictures. Chilblain-like lesions were the most common form of presentation, which tend to appear as self-healing, erythematous-necrotic plaques mostly on the feet, in young patients with no systemic symptoms associated. Importantly, we visualized viral particles with electron microscopy in 5 of 13 cases analyzed. In this study, we seek to draw a picture of the spectrum of clinicopathologic lesions that may appear in the skin in the context of COVID-19. Although apparently skin lesions are not correlated with disease severity, it may help in some cases to recognize and control the spread of the infection sooner.

AB  - COVID-19 is characterized by two major clinical phases, the SARS-CoV-2 infection of target cells and tissues, and a deep inflammatory state, known as "cytokine storm", caused by activation of pro-inflammatory genes, such as NF-kB, STAT-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1ß. Among possible anti-inflammatory agents, the "microRNA targeting" should be carefully considered, since it is well known that microRNAs are deeply involved in the expression of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The working general hypothesis is that targeting the microRNA network might be important for the development of therapeutic approaches to counteract the COVID-19 induction of inflammatory response. This hypothesis is based on several publications demonstrating the use of miRNA mimics for inhibitory effects on the production of proteins characterizing the COVID-19 "cytokine storm".

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence on whether the influenza vaccine could exacerbate immune-related adverse events, including myopericarditis (MP), in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), is still conflicting. We explored this issue through a global real-world approach. METHODS: We queried the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and VigiBase to retrieve cases of MP in which the influenza vaccine and ICIs were recorded as suspect and were concomitantly reported. For the included cases, causality assessment and Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) algorithms were applied. RESULTS: There were 191 and 399 reports of MP with the influenza vaccine that were retrieved (VAERS and VigiBase, respectively). No case of MP reporting the concomitant use of ICIs and the influenza vaccine was found in VAERS, while three cases of myocarditis were retrieved in VigiBase. All of the cases were unclassifiable for a causality assessment because of the lack of data concerning latency. According to the DIPS, one report was categorized as possible and two as doubtful. CONCLUSION: The paucity of cases coupled with the doubtful causality assessment make the potential interaction between influenza vaccines and ICIs in cancer patients negligible from clinical and epidemiological standpoints. These findings support the cardiovascular safety of the influenza vaccination, which remains strongly recommended in cancer patients, especially in the current COVID-19 era.

AB  - Unaccompanied minors (UMs) are children under 18 who arrive on the territory of a foreign country without the care of a guardian. In many countries their access to social and health care services depends on their legal recognition as minors. For instance, in France, high rejection rates of minor status place unprotected UMs in social precarity, such that in Paris, civil society organizations (CSOs) have stepped in to offer social, medical, and psychological care to unprotected UMs. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic however, CSOs had to adapt their care provision.We review promising CSO-led initiatives to ensure continuity of care for this population. In doing so, we highlight how, by promoting UMs' healthy behaviors in the context of the pandemic, continued social interactions between CSO members and unprotected UMs may have contributed to disease prevention among UMs. In addition, CSOs have continued to advocate for sheltering unprotected UMs, calling on public authorities to take action.

AB  - Understanding the mechanism for antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. We recently isolated a large number of monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Here we select the top three most potent yet variable neutralizing antibodies for in-depth structural and functional analyses. Crystal structural comparisons reveal differences in the angles of approach to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the size of the buried surface areas, and the key binding residues on the RBD of the viral spike glycoprotein. One antibody, P2C-1F11, most closely mimics binding of receptor ACE2, displays the most potent neutralizing activity in vitro and conferred strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice. It also occupies the largest binding surface and demonstrates the highest binding affinity to RBD. More interestingly, P2C-1F11 triggers rapid and extensive shedding of S1 from the cell-surface expressed spike glycoprotein, with only minimal such effect by the remaining two antibodies. These results offer a structural and functional basis for potent neutralization via disruption of the very first and critical steps for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

AB  - In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper provides recommendations for medical eye care during the easing of control measures after lockdown. The guidelines presented are based on a literature review and consensus among all Spanish Ophthalmology Societies regarding protection measures recommended for the ophthalmologic care of patients with or without confirmed COVID-19 in outpatient, inpatient, emergency and surgery settings. We recommend that all measures be adapted to the circumstances and availability of personal protective equipment at each centre and also highlight the need to periodically update recommendations as we may need to readopt more restrictive measures depending on the local epidemiology of the virus. These guidelines are designed to avoid the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among both patients and healthcare staff as we gradually return to normal medical practice, to prevent postoperative complications and try to reduce possible deficiencies in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of the ophthalmic diseases. With this update (5th ) the Spanish Society of Ophthalmology is placed as one of the major ophthalmology societies providing periodic and systematized recommendations for ophthalmic care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The economic and public health burden of fragility fractures of the hip in Germany is high. The likelihood of requiring long-term care and the risk of suffering from a secondary fracture increases substantially after sustaining an initial fracture. Neither appropriate confirmatory diagnostics of the suspected underlying osteoporosis nor therapy, which are well-recognised approaches to reduce the burden of fragility fractures, are routinely initiated in the German healthcare system. Therefore, the aim of the study FLS-CARE is to evaluate whether a coordinated care programme can close the prevention gap for patients suffering from a fragility hip fracture through the implementation of systematic diagnostics, a falls prevention programme and guideline-adherent interventions based on the Fracture Liaison Services model. METHODS: The study is set up as a non-blinded, cluster-randomised, controlled trial with unequal cluster sizes. Allocation to intervention group (FLS-CARE) and control group (usual care) follows an allocation ratio of 1:1 using trauma centres as the unit of allocation. Sample size calculations resulted in a total of 1216 patients (608 patients per group distributed over 9 clusters) needed for the analysis. After informed consent, all participants are assessed directly at discharge, after 3 months, 12 months and 24 months. The primary outcome measure of the study is the secondary fracture rate 24 months after initial hip fracture. Secondary outcomes include differences in the number of falls, mortality, quality-adjusted life years, activities of daily living and mobility. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness/utility of FLS implementation in Germany. Findings of the process evaluation will also shed light on potential barriers to the implementation of FLS in the context of the German healthcare system. Challenges for the study include the successful integration of the outpatient sector as well as the future course of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and its influence on the intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To update guidance regarding the management of psoriatic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: The task force (TF) includes 18 physician voting members with expertise in dermatology, rheumatology, epidemiology, infectious diseases, and critical care. The TF was supplemented by non-voting members, which included fellows and National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) staff. Clinical questions relevant to the psoriatic disease community were informed by inquiries received by the NPF. A Delphi process was conducted. RESULTS: The TF updated evidence for the original 22 statements and added 5 new recommendations. The average of the votes was within the category of agreement for all statements, 13 with high consensus, 14 with moderate consensus. LIMITATIONS: The evidence behind many guidance statements is variable in quality and/or quantity. CONCLUSION: These statements provide guidance for the management of patients with psoriatic disease on topics ranging from how the disease and its treatments impact COVID-19 risk, how medical care can be optimized during the pandemic, what patients should do to lower their risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 (including novel vaccination), and what they should do if they develop COVID-19. The guidance is a living document that is continuously updated by the TF as data emerge.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether people of Color experienced disparate levels of employment loss in frontline versus non-frontline occupations during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey data was analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Percent change in number employed was tabulated quarterly for groups by race and ethnicity (Black or African American, Asian American, or Hispanic or Latinx compared to White or non-Hispanic or Latinx) and frontline occupation status between January 1 and June 30, 2020. Two-tailed two-sample tests of proportions were used to compare groups statistically. RESULTS: More dramatic declines in number employed occurred in the Black or African American, Asian American, and Hispanic or Latinx groups. When stratified by sector, greater declines were noted in the Hispanic or Latinx and Asian American frontline, and Black or African American non-frontline groups when compared to the referent groups. CONCLUSIONS: Structural racism has further affected people of Color through differential employment loss during the onset of the pandemic, both overall and by sector. However, the effect of sector varies dramatically across racial and ethnic groups. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Because employment is an important social determinant of health and a potential risk factor for contracting COVID-19, these trends may provide important context for the prioritization of PPE and immunizations, as well as the provision of stable health insurance and income support for vulnerable workers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Social distancing and lockdown measures are among the main government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures aim to limit the COVID-19 infection rate and reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19. Given we are likely to see local lockdowns until a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, and their effectiveness depends on public acceptability, it is important to understand public preference for government responses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study will investigate the public's preferences for pandemic responses in the UK. Attributes (and levels) are based on: (1) lockdown measures described in policy documents; (2) literature on preferences for lockdown measures and (3) a social media analysis. Attributes include: lockdown type; lockdown length; postponement of usual non-urgent medical care; number of excess deaths; number of infections; impact on household spending and job losses. We will prepilot the DCE using virtual think aloud interviews with respondents recruited via Facebook. We will collect preference data using an online survey of 4000 individuals from across the four UK countries (1000 per country). We will estimate the relative importance of the attributes, and the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between attributes. We will test if respondents' preferences differ based on moral attitudes (using the Moral Foundation Questionnaire), socioeconomic circumstances (age, education, economic insecurity, health status), country of residence and experience of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Aberdeen's College Ethics Research Board (CERB) has approved the study (reference: CERB/2020/6/1974). We will seek CERB approval for major changes from the developmental and pilot work. Peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and results will be presented at public health and health economic conferences nationally and internationally. A lay summary will be published on the Health Economics Research Unit blog.

AB  - Between the 2nd and 3rd centuries the Roman Empire suffered two great plagues, the Antonine Plague, of which there is a bibliography, and the lesser known Plague of Cyprian. As an overview, both pandemics resemble the crisis that in 2020 the Coronavirus is generating in many aspects of human life. This article focuses on the impact that the Cyprian plague had in the context of the crisis of the third century, its mortality is estimated between 10-20% of the population in the affected places, finally its effects generated several of the necessary conditions for the transition from the ancient to the medieval world. It is about understanding how the cycle of plagues that went from the 2nd century to the 3rd century changed the appearance of the Roman world and what lessons history gives us 1700 years later.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy is unusual, poorly defined and is linked with significant hypercoagulability and microthrombotic and macrothrombotic complications leading to worse outcomes and higher mortality. Conventional coagulation assays do not always actively reflect these derangements and might fail to detect this coagulopathy. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHA) provide a possible tool that adds to conventional coagulation assays in identifying this hypercoagulable state. VHA has been mostly used in surgery and trauma but it's still not well defined in sepsis patients with lack of large randomized trials. Few studies described VHA findings in patients with COVID-19 showing significant hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown. Clinicians taking care of these patients might have little experience interpreting VHA results. By reviewing the available literature on the use of VHA in sepsis, and the current knowledge on COVID-19-associated coagulopathy we provide clinicians with a practical guide on VHA utilization in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization named the phenomenon of misinformation spread through the social media "infodemics", and recognized the need to curb it. Misinformation infodemics undermine not only population safety, but also compliance to the suggestions/prophylactic measures recommended in pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to review the impact of social media on general population "fear" in "infoveillance" studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PRISMA protocol was followed and six out of twenty studies were retrieved, meta-analyzed, and had their findings presented in the form of a Forest plot. RESULTS: The summary random and significant event rate was 0.298, 95% CI respectively 0.213 and 0.400, suggesting that social media-circulated misinformation related to COVID-19 triggered public fear and other psychological manifestations. These findings merit special attention by public health authorities. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, "infodemiology" and Infoveillance are valid tools in the hands of epidemiologists to help prevent dissemination of false information with potentially damaging effects.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed long-standing system problems of U. S. health care ranging from access barriers, uncontrolled prices and costs, unacceptable quality, widespread disparities and inequities, and marginalization of public health. All of these have been well documented by international comparisons. Our largely privatized market-based system and medical-industrial complex have been ill equipped to respond effectively to the pandemic. The accompanying economic downturn exacerbates these problems that further reveal the failures of our largely for-profit private health insurance industry, dependent as it is on continued government subsidies while it profiteers on the backs of vulnerable Americans. This article brings historical perspective to these problems, and provides markers of the extent of our unpreparedness and ineffective response to the pandemic. Coherent national health and public health policies are urgently needed based on evidence-based science, not political pressures. Financing reform is necessary, such as through single-payer Medicare for All. Eight takeaway lessons are summarized that can help to inform now best to rebuild U. S. health care and public health, an urgent task for the incoming Biden administration.

AB  - A novel SARS-like coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has recently become a worldwide pandemic. Researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds (social to natural science, health and medicine, etc.) have studied different aspects of the pandemic. The current situation has revealed how the ongoing development of nanotechnology and nanomedicine can accelerate the fight against the novel viruses. A comprehensive solution to this and future pandemic outbreaks includes preventing the spread of the virus through anti-viral personal protective equipment (PPE) and anti-viral surfaces, plus efforts to encourage behavior to minimize risks. Studies of previously introduced anti-viral biomaterials and their optimization to fight against SARS-CoV-2 is the foundation of most of the recent progress. The identification of non-symptomatic patients and symptomatic patients is vital. Reviewing published research highlights the pivotal roles of nanotechnology and biomaterials in the development and efficiency of detection techniques, e.g., by applying nanotechnology and nanomedicine as part of the road map in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this review, we discuss efforts to deploy nanotechnology, biomaterials, and stem cells in each step of the fight against SARS-CoV-2, which may provide a framework for future efforts in combating global pandemics.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic will continue to pose a major public health threat until vaccination-mediated herd immunity is achieved. Most projections predict vaccines will reach a large subset of the population late in 2021 or early 2022. In the meantime, countries are exploring options to remove strict lockdown measures and allow society and the economy to return to normal function. One possibility is to expand on existing COVID-19 testing strategies by including large-scale rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCTs). Currently, there is significant variability in performance and features of available POCTs, making selection and procurement of an appropriate test for specific use case difficult. In this review, we have used the World Health Organization's (WHO) recently published target product profiles (TPPs) for specific use cases of COVID-19 diagnostic tests to screen for top-performing POCTs on the market. Several POCTs, based on clinical sensitivity/specificity, the limit of detection, and time to results, which meet WHO TPP criteria for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 (acute infection) or indirect diagnosis of past infection (host antibodies), are highlighted here.

AB  - In this correspondence the authors try to show that guidelines and recommendations including what was published by EAU rapid reaction group must be further updated and tailored according to different epidemiologic data in different countries. The authors assign the countries worldwide in three categories. First category comprises countries that experience the secondary surges smoother than the first one. The second category include countries with stronger or -merging and rising-secondary surges and the third category encompasses countries with successful initial response and secondary stronger but still more controllable surges. Authors proclaim that after passing the first baffling impact we find out that postponement strategies preached in many of these scout treatises are no more suitable at least for the countries delineated in the second category and can culminate in performance of procedures in worse. The authors proffer Iranian Urology Association COVID-19 Taskforce Pamphlet(IUA-CTP) as a paragonic document mentioning it's the time we must recognise the wide variability of the situation in different regions and any advisory position must consider this huge variance in epidemiologic profile.

AB  - COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an international concern. This infection requires urgent efforts to develop new antiviral compounds. To date, no specific drug in controlling this disease has been identified. Developing the new treatment is usually time consuming, therefore using the repurposing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs could be an effective strategy to respond immediately. In this review, a number of broad-spectrum antivirals with potential efficacy to inhibit the virus replication via targeting the virus spike protein (S protein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) that are critical in the pathogenesis and life cycle of coronavirus, have been evaluated as possible treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Contaminated surfaces and indoor environments are important sources of infectious spread within hospital and non-hospital facilities. Bacterial infections such as infections with Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile (C. difficile) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and its antibiotic resistant strains continue to pose a significant risk to healthcare workers and patients. Additionally, the recent emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need for safe and effective methods to decontaminate surfaces to control infection spread in hospitals and the community. To address these critical needs, we tested a photocatalytic reactor decontamination method to disinfect contaminated surfaces in a hospital and a laboratory setting. By placing the reactor in a test hospital room, growth of S. aureus and C. difficile were significantly reduced compared with a control room. Additionally, using a model enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, dengue virus type 2 (DENV2), we showed that the use of the photocatalytic reactor reduces viral infectivity. Collectively, the results demonstrate the potential utility of photocatalytic reactors in reducing the spread of highly contagious bacterial and viral infections through contaminated surfaces and environments.

AB  - Type I and Type II pneumocytes are two forms of epithelial cells found lining the alveoli in the lungs. Type II pneumocytes exclusively secrete 'pulmonary surfactants', a lipo-protein complex made up of 90% lipids (mainly phospholipids) and 10% surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D). Respiratory diseases like influenza, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are reported to preferentially attack type II pneumocytes of the lungs. After viral invasion, consequent viral propagation and destruction of type II pneumocytes causes altered surfactant production, resulting in dyspnea and Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Exogenous animal-derived or synthetic pulmonary surfactant therapy has already shown immense success in the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and has the potential to contribute efficiently to repairing damaged alveoli and preventing SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Furthermore, the early detection of surfactant collectins (SP-A and SP-D) in the circulatory system can be a significant clinical marker for disease prognosis in the near future.

AB  - Nowadays, humanity faces one of the most serious health crises, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is related to the high rate of interhuman transmission of the virus, variability of clinical presentation, and the absence of specific therapeutic methods. COVID-19 can manifest with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially among the elderly. In some cases, the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia may be the first to appear. The pathophysiological mechanisms of hyponatremia among patients with COVID-19 are diverse, including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), digestive loss of sodium ions, reduced sodium ion intake or use of diuretic therapy. Hyponatremia may also be considered a negative prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We need further studies to evaluate the etiology and therapeutic management of hyponatremia in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 has become a pandemic since its emergence in Wuhan, China. The disease process was initially defined by presence of respiratory symptoms; however, it is now well studied and shown in evidence that this is a multisystem process. Involvement of gastrointestinal (GI) system has been identified, and GI symptoms can be the only presenting symptoms in some patients. Hence, it is important to identify and understand the GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 for appropriate care of patient. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to identify the GI symptoms of COVID-19 and identify association of diarrhea with severity of COVID-19. We performed extensive search of Medline and Embase from December 2019 to May 2020 to identify articles reporting GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was prevalence of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and secondary outcome was the association of diarrhea with disease severity. A total of 38 studies with 8407 patients were included. Of the total patients, 15.47% patients had at least one GI symptom. The pooled prevalence of nausea/vomiting was 7.53% and diarrhea was 11.52%. On metaanalysis, patients with diarrhea as one of the presenting symptoms were more likely to have severe disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.11-3.38, p = 0.01). Our systematic review and metaanalysis demonstrated that GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Presence of diarrhea as a presenting symptom is associated with increased disease severity and likely worse prognosis. Early recognition of patients is needed for prompt management of this at-risk population.

AB  - Existing coronavirus named as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has speeded its spread across the globe immediately after emergence in China, Wuhan region, at the end of the year 2019. Different techniques, including genome sequencing, structural feature classification by electron microscopy, and chest imaging using computed tomography, are primarily used to diagnose and screen SARS-CoV-2 suspected individuals. Determination of the viral structure, surface proteins, and genome sequence has provided a design blueprint for the diagnostic investigations of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and rapidly emerging diagnostic technologies, vaccine trials, and cell-entry-inhibiting drugs. Here, we describe recent understandings on the spike glycoprotein (S protein), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and their receptor complex. This report also aims to review recently established diagnostic technologies and developments in surveillance measures for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the characteristics and performance of emerging techniques. Smartphone apps for contact tracing can help nations to conduct surveillance measures before a vaccine and effective medicines become available. We also describe promising point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technologies that are under consideration by researchers for advancement beyond the proof-of-concept stage. Developing novel diagnostic techniques needs to be facilitated to establish automatic systems, without any personal involvement or arrangement to curb an existing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic crisis, and could also be appropriate for avoiding the emergence of a future epidemic crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on the challenges and risks faced by frontline healthcare workers (HCW). Our aim is to describe the clinical outcomes and risk factors for SARS- CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS: Three databases were surveyed identifying 328 articles. Of these, 225 articles did not meet inclusion criteria; 97 full-text article were reviewed. Finally, after further revision, 30 articles were included in the systematic review and 28 used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies were identified involving 119,883 patients. The mean age of the patients was 38.37 years (95% CI, 36.72 - 40.03) and males comprised 21.4% (95% CI, 12.4 - 34.2) of the population of health workers. The prevalence of HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 is 51.7% (95% CI, 34.7-68.2). The total prevalence of co-morbidities in 7 studies was 18.4% (95% CI, 15.5 - 21.7). The most prevalent symptoms were fever 27.5% (95% CI, 17.6-40.3), cough 26.1% (95% CI, 18.1-36).The prevalence of hospitalization of HCW was 15.1% (95% CI, 5.6-35) in 13 studies and the prevalence of death was 1.5% (95% CI, 0.5-3.9) in 12 studies. Comparisons of HCW with and without infection showed an increased relative risk for COVID-19 related to PPE, workplace setting, profession, exposure, contacts, and testing. CONCLUSION: A significant number of HCW have been reported to be infected with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the pandemic, with a prevalence of hospitalization of 15.1% and mortality of 1.5%. Further data is needed to track the continued risks in HCW as the pandemic evolves and health systems adapt.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century. Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities. OBJECTIVE: The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation. METHODS: An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner. RESULTS: The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.

AB  - Microorganisms can be present in common equipment of practice, which spread Healthcare-associated infections (HALs), generating major health issues, not only in the hospital environment but outside as well. Especially in this impending crisis due to SARS CoV-19 virus, disinfection (in general) turns out to be of paramount importance and portable disinfection in particular. The rampant spread of the COVID 19 virus, has pushed thinkers to come up with unique disinfection solutions that can help curb the spread of the virus in other places other than the medical facilities. The article aims to establish a design of a portable ultraviolet c disinfectant device that is based on the core principles of origami- the ancient Japanese art of paper folding. Resorting to origami has helped to make the device ultra-portable, robust and can be easily manufactured in order to be commercially produced as an inexpensive alternative to the cost portable disinfection devices in the market.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of ongoing challenges and presents an increased risk of illness in group environments, including jails, long term care facilities, schools, and, of course, residential college campuses. Early reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detectable in wastewater in advance of confirmed cases sparked widespread interest in wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for mitigation of COVID-19 outbreaks. One hypothesis was that wastewater surveillance might provide a cost-effective alternative to other more expensive approaches such as pooled and random testing of groups. In this paper, we report the outcomes of a wastewater surveillance pilot program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a large urban university with a substantial population of students living in on-campus dormitories. Surveillance was conducted at the building level on a thrice-weekly schedule throughout the university's fall residential semester. In multiple cases, wastewater surveillance enabled identification of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases that were not detected by other components of the campus monitoring program, which also included in-house contact tracing, symptomatic testing, scheduled testing of student athletes, and daily symptom reporting. In the context of all cluster events reported to the University community during the fall semester, wastewater-based testing events resulted in identification of smaller clusters than events triggered by other means. This includes identification of single asymptomatic individuals in dorms with total resident populations of 150-200. While the strategy described was developed for COVID-19, it is likely to be broadly applicable to mitigation of future pandemics in universities and other group-living environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding was provided by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and by the State of North Carolina.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The data included are not human subjects data or are publicly available via university and county health department websites.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2 have been implicated in cell entry for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung epithelium might have implications for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. We use human genetic variants that proxy angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug effects and cardiovascular risk factors to investigate whether these exposures affect lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression and circulating ACE2 levels. We observed no consistent evidence of an association of genetically predicted serum ACE levels with any of our outcomes. There was weak evidence for an association of genetically predicted serum ACE levels with ACE2 gene expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium (p = 0.014), but this finding did not replicate. There was evidence of a positive association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung ACE2 gene expression in the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) study (p = 4 × 10-4) and with circulating plasma ACE2 levels in the INTERVAL study (p = 0.03), but not with lung ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium study (p = 0.68). There were no associations of genetically proxied liability to the other cardiometabolic traits with any outcome. This study does not provide consistent evidence to support an effect of serum ACE levels (as a proxy for ACE inhibitors) or cardiometabolic risk factors on lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression or plasma ACE2 levels.

AB  - The evidence of racial health disparities is profound. Much attention has been given to the disparity in maternal morbidity and mortality experienced by Black mothers. The disparity in Black lives lost from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further highlighted the disparity in health outcomes for Black people. Although COVID-19 is a new disease, the reason for the health disparity is the same as in maternal morbidity and mortality: implicit bias and structural racism. Implicit bias among health care professionals leads to disparities in how health care is delivered. Generations of structural racism perpetuated through racial residential segregation, economic suppression, and health care inequality have normalized the poorer health outcomes for Black Americans. It is easy to dismiss these issues as someone else's problem, because health care professionals often fail to acknowledge the effect of implicit bias in their own practices. We all need to be highly critical of our own practices and look introspectively for implicit bias to find the cure. Health care organizations must invest time and resources into investigating the structural racism that exists within our own walls.

AB  - We hypothesize that polycations, such as nuclear histones, released by neutrophils COVID-19 aggravate COVID-19 by multiple mechanisms: (A) Neutralization of the electrostatic repulsion between the virus particles and the cell membrane, thereby enhancing receptor-mediated entry. (B) Binding to the virus particles, thereby inducing opsonin-mediated endocytosis. (C) Adding to the cytotoxicity, in conjunction with oxidants, cytokines and other pro-inflammatory substances secreted by cells of the innate immunity system. These effects may be alleviated by the administration of negatively charged polyanions such as heparins and heparinoids.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the variation in the outbreak of COVID-19 across departments in continental France. We use information on the cumulated number of deaths, discharged patients and infections from COVID-19 at the department level, and study how these relate to income inequality, controlling for other factors. We find that unfortunately, inequality kills: departments with higher income inequality face more deaths, more discharged (gravely ill) patients and more infections. While other papers have studied the impact of the level of income on the severity of COVID-19, we find that it is in fact the dispersion across incomes within the same department that drives the results. Our results suggest that individuals in relatively more precarious conditions deserve dedicated policies, to avoid that temporary shocks such as COVID-19 lead to permanent increases in inequality.

AB  - The article compares two of the most followed indices in the monitoring of COVID-19 epidemic cases: the Rt and the RDt indices. The first was disseminated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and the second, which is more usable due to the lower difficulty of calculation and the availability of data, was adopted by various regional and local institutions.The rationale for the Rt index refers to that for the R0 index, the basic reproduction number, which is used by infectivologists as a measure of contagiousness of a given infectious agent in a completely susceptible population. The RDt index, on the other hand, is borrowed from the techniques of time series analysis for the trend of an event measurement that develops as a function of time. The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population.The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects.The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices. The maximum correlation between Rt and RDt is reached at lag 7 with a value of R exceeding 0.97 (R2=0.944).The two indices, albeit formally distinct, are both valid; they show specific aspects of the phenomenon, but provide basically similar information to the public health decision-maker. Their distinction lies not so much in the method of calculation, rather in the use of different information, i.e., the beginning of symptoms and the swabs outcome.Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a judgment of preference for one of the two indices, but only to invite people to understand their different potentials so that they can choose the one they consider the most appropriate for the purpose they want to use it for.

AB  - Severe forms of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are characterized by an enhanced inflammatory syndrome called "cytokine storm" that produces an aberrant release of high amounts of cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory mediators. The pathogenetic role of the "cytokine storm" has been confirmed by the efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids along with antiviral drugs in the treatment of the severe forms of this disease. Phenylmethimazole (C10) is a derivative of methimazole with anti-inflammatory properties. Studies performed both in vitro and in vivo have shown that C10 is able to block the production of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory molecules involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Particularly, C10 is effective in reducing the increased secretion of cytokines in animal models of endotoxic shock. We hypothesize that these effects are not limited to the endotoxic shock, but can also be applied to any disease characterized by the presence of a "cytokine storm". Therefore, C10 may be a potential drug to be used alternatively or in association with the corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents in the severe forms of COVID-19 as well as other viral diseases that induce a "cytokine storm". Preclinical and clinical studies have to be performed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, present a serious threat to endangered wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations. In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, chimpanzee tracking is a popular tourism activity, offering visitors a chance to view apes in their natural habitats. Chimpanzee tourism is an important source of revenue and thus benefits conservation; however, chimpanzee tracking may also increase the risk of disease transmission from people to chimpanzees directly (e.g., via aerosol transmission) or indirectly (e.g., through the environment or via fomites). This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission. Common behaviors included coughing, sneezing, and urinating, which respectively occurred during 88.1%, 65.4%, and 36.6% of excursions. Per excursion, individuals touched their faces an average of 125.84 ± 34.45 times and touched large tree trunks or branches (which chimpanzees might subsequently touch) an average of 230.14 ± 108.66 times. These results show that many pathways exist by which pathogens might move from humans to chimpanzees in the context of tourism. Guidelines for minimizing the risk of such transmission should consider tourist behavior and the full range of modes by which pathogen transmission might occur between tourists and chimpanzees.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein is the target of vaccine design efforts to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite a low mutation rate, isolates with the D614G substitution in the S protein appeared early during the pandemic and are now the dominant form worldwide. Here, we explore S conformational changes and the effects of the D614G mutation on a soluble S ectodomain construct. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal altered receptor binding domain (RBD) disposition; antigenicity and proteolysis experiments reveal structural changes and enhanced furin cleavage efficiency of the G614 variant. Furthermore, furin cleavage alters the up/down ratio of the RBDs in the G614 S ectodomain, demonstrating an allosteric effect on RBD positioning triggered by changes in the SD2 region, which harbors residue 614 and the furin cleavage site. Our results elucidate SARS-CoV-2 S conformational landscape and allostery and have implications for vaccine design.

AB  - A nationwide lockdown was imposed in India due to COVID-19 pandemic in five phases from 25th March to May 31, 2020. The lockdown restricted major anthropogenic activities, primarily vehicular and industrial, thereby reducing the particulate matter concentration. This work investigates the variation in Black Carbon (BC) concentration and its sources (primarily Fossil Fuel (ff) burning and Biomass Burning (bb)) over Delhi from 18th February to July 31, 2020, covering one month of pre-lockdown phase, all the lockdown phases, and two months of successive lockdown relaxations. The daily average BC concentration varied from 0.22 to 16.92 μg/m3, with a mean value of 3.62 ± 2.93 μg/m3. During Pre-Lockdown (PL, 18th Feb-24th March 2020), Lockdown-1 (L1, 25th March-14th April 2020), Lockdown-2 (L2, 15th April-3rd May 2020), Lockdown-3 (L3, 4th-17th May 2020), Lockdown-4 (L4, 18th-31st May 2020), Unlock-1 (UN1, June 2020), and Unlock-2 (UN2, July 2020) the average BC concentrations were 7.93, 1.73, 2.59, 3.76, 3.26, 2.07, and 2.70 μg/m3, respectively. During the lockdown and unlock phases, BC decreased up to 78% compared to the PL period. The BC source apportionment studies show that fossil fuel burning was the dominant BC source during the entire sampling period. From L1 to UN2 an increasing trend in BCff contribution was observed (except L3) due to the successive relaxations given to anthropogenic activities. BCff contribution dipped briefly during L3 due to the intensive crop residue burning events in neighboring states. CWT analysis showed that local emission sources were the dominant contributors to BC concentration over Delhi.

AB  - In the midst of the current coronavirus pandemic, the United States continues to struggle with an ongoing opioid epidemic, initially fueled by widespread prescribing of opioid medications during the 1990s. The primary reason for prescribing opioids is to treat pain. Women have more acute and chronic pain and have been prescribed these drugs in significantly greater numbers than men. Comparison of women and men with chronic pain also shows that women receive the majority of prescription opioids, and the use of these prescribed medications became the major pathway to misuse and addiction for women. Yet, recognition of the extent of women's exposure to opioids and the attendant consequences has been limited. Attempts to stem the overall tide of the epidemic focused on reducing the availability of prescription opioids. However, as these medications became more difficult to obtain and treatment opportunities were limited, many turned to other synthetic opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl. Thus, the public health crisis of opioid addiction has endured. This paper highlights the importance of understanding differences among women and men in opioid use and its biological and psychosocial effects to advance the gender-based treatment approaches and effective public health policy.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an epidemic disease which appeared at the end of the year 2019 in a sudden increase in number and considered as a pandemic disease caused by a viral infection and it has threatened most countries towards the emergency search for new anti-SARS-COV drugs /vaccines. At present, the number of clinical trials is ongoing worldwide on different drugs i.e. Hydroxychloroquine, Remedisvir, Favipiravir that utilizes various mechanisms of actions. A few world countries are currently processing for clinical trials which may result in a positive manner. Favipiravir (FPV) represents one of the feasible treatment options for COVID-19, if trials result seems positive. Favipiravir will be one among the developed authoritative possible drugs to warrant the benefits to mankind with large-scale production in order to meet the demands by the current pandemic Covid-19 outbreak and the future epidemic outbreaks. In this review, the authors tried to explore key molecules, which will be supportive for scheming COVID-19 research.

AB  - The enormous health and economic challenges precipitated by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are comparable or even greater than those associated with previous historical world crises. Alcohol use, especially drinking to cope with stress, is a concern, as an increase in its sales has been reported in some countries during the quarantine. This study aims to provide a better understanding of what to expect in terms of alcohol consumption, risk factors for excessive use, and its potential consequences during this pandemic based on previous experiences. We investigated how traumatic events related to alcohol consumption. Studies on mass traumatic events (i.e., terrorism as 9/11), epidemic outbreaks (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] in 2003), economic crises (such as 2008's Great Recession), and COVID-19 were selected. The main keywords used to select the studies were alcohol use, drinking patterns, alcohol use disorders, and alcohol-related consequences. Previous studies reported increases in alcohol use associated with those events mediated, at least partially, by anxiety and depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Being male, young, and single also seems to be associated with a higher vulnerability to develop risky drinking behavior after those tragic events. The discussion of previous risk and protective factors can contribute to elaborate more specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic on people's mental health, especially alcohol-related problems.

AB  - Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes significant losses in the poultry industry throughout the world. Here we characterize the lesions of infectious bronchitis (IB), IBV prevalence and identify the circulating strains in small flocks in California. Backyard chickens (BYCs) submitted to the Davis (Northern California; NorCal) and San Bernardino (Southern California; SoCal) branches of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System from January through March 2019 were included in the study. Trachea, kidney, and cecal tonsils were collected for qRT-PCR, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequence analysis. A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens succumbed by other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains. The findings in this study indicate that small flocks can be reservoirs of IBV and might facilitate evolution of new variants as well as reversion of attenuated strains to virulence.

AB  - This commentary draws together the confluence of current events - COVID-19 pandemic and racial injustice. Vulnerability to COVID-19 cannot be understood by age alone but within the context of inequity. We first review how COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Black and Latinx populations across the life span with the latest data from New York City Department of Health. We then discuss critical race theory and analyze longstanding inequities in health, economic, and social conditions that heighten the risk for vulnerability. We conclude with a discussion for the social work profession on the issues of defunding the police to undoing stereotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many people with dementia are cared for at home by unpaid informal caregivers, usually family members. Caregivers may experience a range of physical, emotional, financial and social harms, which are often described collectively as caregiver burden. The degree of burden experienced is associated with characteristics of the caregiver, such as gender, and characteristics of the person with dementia, such as dementia stage, and the presence of behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is a strong predictor of admission to residential care for people with dementia. Psychoeducational interventions might prevent or reduce caregiver burden. Overall, they are intended to improve caregivers' knowledge about the disease and its care; to increase caregivers' sense of competence and their ability to cope with difficult situations; to relieve feelings of isolation and allow caregivers to attend to their own emotional and physical needs. These interventions are heterogeneous, varying in their theoretical framework, components, and delivery formats. Interventions that are delivered remotely, using printed materials, telephone or video technologies, may be particularly suitable for caregivers who have difficulty accessing face-to-face services because of their own health problems, poor access to transport, or absence of substitute care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures in many countries required people to be isolated in their homes, including people with dementia and their family carers. In such circumstances, there is no alternative to remote delivery of interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of remotely delivered interventions aiming to reduce burden and improve mood and quality of life of informal caregivers of people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, MEDLINE, Embase and four other databases, as well as two international trials registries, on 10 April 2020. We also examined the bibliographies of relevant review papers and published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials that assessed the remote delivery of structured interventions for informal caregivers who were providing care for people with dementia living at home. Caregivers had to be unpaid adults (relatives or members of the person's community). The interventions could be delivered using printed materials, the telephone, the Internet or a mixture of these, but could not involve any face-to-face contact with professionals. We categorised intervention components as information, training or support. Information interventions included two key elements: (i) they provided standardised information, and (ii) the caregiver played a passive role. Support interventions promoted interaction with other people (professionals or peers). Training interventions trained caregivers in practical skills to manage care. We excluded interventions that were primarily individual psychotherapy. Our primary outcomes were caregiver burden, mood, health-related quality of life and dropout for any reason. Secondary outcomes were caregiver knowledge and skills, use of health and social care resources, admission of the person with dementia to institutional care, and quality of life of the person with dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies were done independently by two review authors. We used the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) to describe the interventions. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model to derive estimates of effect size. We used GRADE methods to describe our degree of certainty about effect estimates. MAIN RESULTS: We included 26 studies in this review (2367 participants). We compared (1) interventions involving training, support or both, with or without information (experimental interventions) with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control (12 studies, 944 participants); and (2) the same experimental interventions with provision of information alone (14 studies, 1423 participants). We downgraded evidence for study limitations and, for some outcomes, for inconsistency between studies. There was a frequent risk of bias from self-rating of subjective outcomes by participants who were not blind to the intervention. Randomisation methods were not always well-reported and there was potential for attrition bias in some studies. Therefore, all evidence was of moderate or low certainty. In the comparison of experimental interventions with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control, we found that the experimental interventions probably have little or no effect on caregiver burden (nine studies, 597 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to 0.23); depressive symptoms (eight studies, 638 participants; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.12); or health-related quality of life (two studies, 311 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.32). The experimental interventions probably result in little or no difference in dropout for any reason (eight studies, 661 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.53). In the comparison of experimental interventions with a control condition of information alone, we found that experimental interventions may result in a slight reduction in caregiver burden (nine studies, 650 participants; SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.04); probably result in a slight improvement in depressive symptoms (11 studies, 1100 participants; SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.06); may result in little or no difference in caregiver health-related quality of life (two studies, 257 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.21); and probably result in an increase in dropouts for any reason (12 studies, 1266 participants; RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.20). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Remotely delivered interventions including support, training or both, with or without information, may slightly reduce caregiver burden and improve caregiver depressive symptoms when compared with provision of information alone, but not when compared with usual treatment, waiting list or attention control. They seem to make little or no difference to health-related quality of life. Caregivers receiving training or support were more likely than those receiving information alone to drop out of the studies, which might limit applicability. The efficacy of these interventions may depend on the nature and availability of usual services in the study settings.

AB  - The coronavirus crisis has appeared like some vast, cruel sociological experiment. It has confined people to their homes, radically disturbed their taken-for-granted knowledge and beliefs, and forced them to alter behaviors once casually, even unthinkingly, employed in their everyday personal, working, and social lives. What has been learned? How might this experience stimulate a reimagining of the curriculum? More fundamentally, how might it lead to the development of a knowledgeable, intelligent, effective public, able to engage freely and equally in decision-making at all levels of social, cultural, political, and economic life, as a condition for personal freedom? This article explores the implications of "lockdown" or "confinement" to homes, which has suspended freedom of movement, limited the freedom to associate with others, and established rituals of hygiene regarding surfaces. These experiences of physical confinement and limitation of ordinary freedoms raise the central question of how to return to "normal" and, indeed, what will count as normal. In exploring the issues posed by these questions, this article offers an approach to pedagogical and curriculum practice that seeks to embed democratic practice at all levels of organization and interaction between individuals.

AB  - The unparalleled global effort to combat the continuing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic over the last year has resulted in promising prophylactic measures. However, a need still exists for cheap, effective therapeutics and targeting multiple points in the viral life cycle could help tackle the current as well as future coronaviruses. Here we leverage our recently developed, ultra-large scale in silico screening platform, VirtualFlow, to search for inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. In this unprecedented structure-based virtual campaign, we screened roughly 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also targeted critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interactions.

AB  - Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is currently a global health crisis. This viral infection is frequently associated with hypercoagulability with a high incidence of thromboembolic complications that can be fatal. In many situations, the standard coagulation tests (SCT) fail to detect this state of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 since clotting times are not or only mildly affected. The role of viscoelastic tests such as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) during this pandemic has been explored in this review. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy as evident from thromboelastometry parameters can vary from hypercoagulability due to increased fibrin polymerization and decreased fibrinolysis to bleeding from hypocoagulability. A multi-modal diagnostic and monitoring approach including both thromboelastometry and SCT such as plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer concentrations is recommended. Thromboelastometry provides comprehensive information about the full coagulation status of each patient and detects individual variations. Since COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is a very dynamic process, the phenotype can change during the course of infection and in response to anticoagulation therapy. Data from published literature provide evidence that combined thromboelastometry and SCT analysis will be helpful in detecting hemostasis issues, guiding anticoagulant therapy and improving outcome in COVID-19 patients. However, more research is needed to develop guidelines and protocols.

AB  - During the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) pandemic, researchers have been seeking low-cost and accessible means of providing protection from its harms, particularly for at-risk individuals such as those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. One possible way is via safe sun exposure, and/or dietary supplementation with induced beneficial mediators (e.g., vitamin D). In this narrative review, we provide rationale and updated evidence on the potential benefits and harms of sun exposure and ultraviolet (UV) light that may impact COVID-19. We review recent studies that provide new evidence for any benefits (or otherwise) of UV light, sun exposure, and the induced mediators, vitamin D and nitric oxide, and their potential to modulate morbidity and mortality induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus-2). We identified substantial interest in this research area, with many commentaries and reviews already published; however, most of these have focused on vitamin D, with less consideration of UV light (or sun exposure) or other mediators such as nitric oxide. Data collected to-date suggest that ambient levels of both UVA and UVB may be beneficial for reducing severity or mortality due to COVID-19, with some inconsistent findings. Currently unresolved are the nature of the associations between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D and COVID-19 measures, with more prospective data needed that better consider lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and personal sun exposure levels. Another short-coming has been a lack of measurement of sun exposure, and its potential to influence COVID-19 outcomes. We also discuss possible mechanisms by which sun exposure, UV light and induced mediators could affect COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, by focusing on likely effects on viral pathogenesis, immunity and inflammation, and potential cardiometabolic protective mechanisms. Finally, we explore potential issues including the impacts of exposure to high dose UV radiation on COVID-19 and vaccination, and effective and safe doses for vitamin D supplementation.

AB  - Long-term care facilities (LTCF) and their vulnerable residents are particularly affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Estimates from various countries suggest that 3-66% of all COVID-19 deaths were residents of LTCF, of which 80% died in their facilities. Despite these significant numbers, recommendations for LTCF for the prevention and medical care of residents during the COVID-19 pandemic are still lacking. These recommendations are based on the existing literature and the expertise of the authors who are specialists in geriatric medicine. The recommendations are addressed to LTCF management, their operators, physicians working in LTCFs and also politicians, to provide the necessary framework conditions. We are confident that our recommendations will offer important help and guidance for LTCFs as well as their physicians. Adherence to these recommendations is likely to improve the outcomes and care of residents in long-term facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID-19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolar-parenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O2 supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics. Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles. Overwhelming immune response associated with "cytokine storms" could activate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in consumption of nitric oxide (NO), a critical vasodilation regulator. In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase (MPO) in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O2 at heme binding sites, decreasing O2 saturation. Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption. Connecting these reactions in a multi-hit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to develop therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the presently prevailing global public health emergency has culminated in international instability in economy. This unprecedented pandemic outbreak pressingly necessitated the trans-disciplinary approach in developing novel/new anti-COVID-19 drugs especially, small molecule inhibitors targeting the seminal proteins of viral etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the traditional medicinal knowledge, we made an attempt through molecular docking analysis to explore the phytochemical constituents of three most commonly used Indian herbs in 'steam inhalation therapy' against well recognized viral receptor proteins. RESULTS: A total of 57 phytochemicals were scrutinized virtually against four structural protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 viz. 3CLpro, ACE-2, spike glycoprotein and RdRp. Providentially, two bioactives from each of the three plants i.e. apigenin-o-7-glucuronide and ellagic acid from Eucalyptus globulus; eudesmol and viridiflorene from Vitex negundo and; vasicolinone and anisotine from Justicia adhatoda were identified to be the best hit lead molecules based on interaction energies, conventional hydrogen bonding numbers and other non-covalent interactions. On comparison with the known SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor -lopinavir and RdRp inhibitor -remdesivir, apigenin-o-7-glucuronide was found to be a phenomenal inhibitor of both protease and polymerase, as it strongly interacts with their active sites and exhibited remarkably high binding affinity. Furthermore, in silico drug-likeness and ADMET prediction analyses clearly evidenced the usability of the identified bioactives to develop as drug against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Overall, the data of the present study exemplifies that the phytochemicals from selected traditional herbs having significance in steam inhalation therapy would be promising in combating COVID-19.

AB  - Ocrelizumab, rituximab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, inebilizumab, and evobrutinib are immunotherapies that target various B cell-related proteins. Most of these treatments have proven efficacy in relapsing and progressive forms of MS and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) or are in advanced stages of clinical development. Currently, ocrelizumab and inebilizumab are licensed for treatment of MS and NMOSD, respectively. This part of the review focuses on monoclonal antibody B cell-depleting strategies in NMOSD and the emerging related myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunoglobulin G-associated disease (MOGAD). Case series and phase 2/3 studies in these inflammatory disorders are assessed. The safety profile of long-term B-cell depletion in MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD will be highlighted. Finally implications of the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the management of patients with these disorders and the use of B cell-depleting agents will be discussed.

AB  - Since its emergence, the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has had enormous physical, social, and psychological impacts worldwide. The aim of this article was to identify elements of our knowledge on asbestos exposure and malignant mesothelioma (MM) that can provide insight into the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and be used to develop adequate interventions. Although the etiology of Covid-19 and MM differs, their psychological impacts have common characteristics: in both diseases, there is a feeling of being exposed through aerial contagion to an "invisible killer" without boundaries that can strike even the strongest individuals. In both cases, affected persons can experience personality dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms; helplessness, hopelessness, and projection of destructive thoughts onto external forces often emerge, while defense mechanisms such as denial, splitting, repression, and reduced emotional expression are used by individuals to contain their overwhelming anxieties. We believe that in both diseases, an integrated multidimensional intervention offered by hospitals and other public health services is the most effective approach to alleviating patients' and caregivers' psychological distress. In particular, we emphasize that in the context of both MM and COVID-19, Brief Psychoanalytic Group therapy can help patients and caregivers attribute meaning to the significant changes in their lives related to the experience of the disease and identify adaptive strategies and more realistic relational modalities to deal with what has happened to them. We also highlight the importance of developing a surveillance system that includes individual anamnestic evaluation of occupational risk factors for COVID-19 disease.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted learning globally, exacerbating regional and global disparities that predated the pandemic. This rupture presents a unique opportunity to reimagine our educational system in times of both calm and crisis. Drawing on the work of political scientist Kathleen Thelen and economist and philosopher Amartya Sen, this article introduces a Framework for adaptability that outlines examples of flexible and equitable adaptation to change. The authors define adaptability as the ability of educational systems to respond to rapidly changing circumstances while maintaining stability, promoting equality, and expanding substantive freedoms and well-being. The key components of educational adaptability are: (1) cooperation, (2) inclusion, and (3) flexibility. This article describes how adaptability in education might be facilitated at individual, community, state and global levels. The authors call attention to a critical need to collectivise our approach to risk at the level of national governance. They suggest that this can be achieved by coordinating various professional, scientific, corporate, community and governmental stakeholders in order to ensure continuity in educational service provision, promoting lifelong learning and overall workforce participation.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected 20 million people worldwide with over 732,000 deaths and trillions of dollars of lost economic productivity. It has put many countries into lockdown to contain the virus and save lives. As COVID-19 cases in some countries start to plateau and societies work hard to 'flatten the curve', leaders are being asked to formulate plans for safe and staged 'exit strategies' to reopen society. Each country will decide on their own exit strategy but many plans are considering similar vital healthcare principles including the maintenance of social distancing to prevent ongoing community transmission, testing capacity, protection of the healthcare systems and the health of their care workers. This review aims to provide an overview of essential factors that plans for exit strategy should consider and their effect on the societies' social and healthcare life.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major societal challenge that requires large-scale behaviour change, widespread collective action and cooperation to reduce viral transmission. Existing literature indicates that several messaging approaches may be effective, including emphasising the benefits to the recipient, aligning with the recipient's moral values and focusing on protecting others. Current research suggests that prosocial public health messages that highlight behaviours linked to societal benefits (eg, protecting 'each other'), rather than focusing on behaviours that protect oneself (eg, protecting 'yourself'), may be a more effective method for communicating strategies related to infectious disease. To investigate this we will conduct a systematic review that will identify what messages and behaviour change techniques have the potential to optimise the effect on population behaviour in relation to reducing transmission of respiratory infections. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic literature search of published and unpublished studies (including grey literature) in electronic databases will be conducted to identify those that meet our inclusion criteria. The search will be run in four electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Scopus. We will also conduct supplementary searches in databases of 'grey' literature such as PsycEXTRA, Social Science Research Network and OSF PREPRINTS, and use the Google Scholar search engine. A systematic approach to searching, screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility will be examined independently by researchers. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool. Disagreements will be resolved by a consensus procedure. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been registered with PROSPERO. No ethical approval is required, as there will be no collection of primary data. The synthesised findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020198874.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated recommendations to avoid travel and congregation in large groups, this meeting took place differently from its original plan. Rather than bringing trainees, clinicians and researchers with an interest in congenital malformations and their underlying morphogenesis together for several days in a workshop with submitted presentations and research lectures, this meeting took place virtually. A 1 day online meeting was organized in order to allow trainees to present their work. This Conference Report includes the highest scoring abstracts submitted by trainees and presented at the 2020 virtual David W. Smith Workshop.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced to adhere to current COVID-19 prevention recommendations. Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarise the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review using L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, that performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and over thirty other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other healthcare settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool, and the GRADE approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported. (Registered in PROSPERO: CRD42020198267). RESULTS: Eighteen studies that fulfilled selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate to high-risk environments N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in HCWs. N95 and equivalent respirators provide more protection than surgical masks. Decontamination and reuse appear feasible to overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. These effects are applicable to emergency trauma care and should inform future recommendations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Review, level II.

AB  - Since December 2019, the world has been experiencing the challenge of facing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a severe infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The individuals with the most severe symptoms and the highest risk of death are the elderly and those with chronic illness. Among chronic conditions, those with a certain degree of chronic inflammation may predispose to a more severe evolution of COVID-19. Elderly with psychiatric disorders can present a persistent inflammatory state, a characteristic of the age's immunological senescence, but the disorder can accentuate that. Social isolation is still the safest way to avoid contamination. However, isolated older people may have or worsen mental health conditions due to isolation and health concerns. In this scenario, a SARS-CoV-2 infection may progress to more severe disease. Conversely, COVID-19 can predispose or aggravate psychiatric disorders, as it induces a cytokine storm, causing systemic hyper inflammation. It may damage the blood-brain barrier, resulting in inflammation in the central nervous system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to reach and trigger an inflammatory process directly in the nervous system. This review makes an update about research on the mental health of the elderly during the pandemic. Also, it discusses the vulnerability of these individuals in the face of stress and in the case of contracting COVID-19, considering mainly the stress's hormonal and inflammatory mechanisms. Finally, the review points out possible care and attention strategies and entertainment and activities that can reduce the damage to mental and physical health and improve the elderly's quality of life. Graphical abstract Isolation and concerns about COVID-19 may harm elderly mental health. Immunosenescence and pandemic stress increase the risk of psychiatric disorders. Stress and disorders may potentiate the elderly's inflammation and COVID-19 symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammation is a risk factor for elderly psychiatric disorders.

Life changes may involve job loss, income reduction due to furlough, death of a beloved one, or social stress due to life habit changes. Many people suffer from social isolation due to lockdown or physical distancing, especially those living alone and without family. This article reviews the association of life events and social isolation with cardiovascular disease, assembling the current state of knowledge for stroke and coronary heart disease. Possible mechanisms underlying the links between life events, social isolation, and cardiovascular disease are outlined. Furthermore, groups with increased vulnerability for cardiovascular disease following life events and social isolation are identified, and clinical implications of results are presented.

AB  - Aircrew fitness-to-fly is among the elements that make aviation the safest form of long-distance transport. The health of cabin crew is a crucial determinant in carrying out safety-related duties. 'Fitness-to-fly' is associated with defined workplace conditions, for which airlines have a legal duty to ensure fitness for employment. We explored the literature on fitness-to-fly to obtain a pragmatic assessment of the challenges for aeromedical examinations. Regulations promulgated by aviation regulatory authorities and airline-internal policies have similar status and meaning, yet there is no harmonised approach internationally, and an inability to conform periodic medical assessments to actual operational fitness. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to better understand fitness-to-fly criteria. Fitness-to-fly measures are mainly based on self-reported data and there is a need for a 'safety' factor for self-reports. Aeromedical evaluations should evolve from meeting medical standards to include pandemics as an element of the overall risk of aircraft operations. Re-evaluating criteria for fitness-to-fly assessment will further the goal of linking research to the actual needs of public health decisionmakers. If airlines are to resume operations at pre-pandemic levels, they must demonstrate to the public and public health agencies that fitness-to-fly assessment is appropriate and effective.

AB  - This article reviews and categorises early policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a dataset of 496 measures taken by 54 countries between January 1 and April 28 and collected by the OECD from government officials and additional sources. Findings show a large diversity of measures, some of which were urgent and necessary, some that may continue to be beneficial once the pandemic has subsided, while others are potentially disruptive for the functioning of markets or damaging for the environment. National allocations of measures show differences between developed OECD countries, which used more agriculture or support related measures, and emerging economies, which focused on trade policies, information provision or food assistance. A minimum USD 47.6 billion was allocated by OECD governments to the agriculture and food sector, mostly in the form of domestic food assistance and support to agriculture and the food chain.

AB  - Older multimorbid persons often fall seriously ill due COVID-19. To be able to participate in social life again, they often need special rehabilitation measures. Geriatric rehabilitation is a multiprofessional service geared to these needs. Paradoxically, however, capacities in geriatric rehabilitation are currently being reduced despite increasing demand. The reasons are manifold and are not only due to the current situation. This article highlights the current situation leading to the COVID rehabilitation paradox and shows ways to learn from it for the future.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently the most significant public health challenge. Its presentation ranges from mild to severe respiratory failure and septic shock. Rapid transmission of the virus is dangerous with a high possibility of life-threatening complications. Lack of treatment standards for SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current dilemma in clinical medicine. Methods: An electronic literature search was done using PubMed to gather information on the pathogenesis, transmission of infection, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for COVID-19. Search items included "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID-19" and "coronavirus infection". Results: In light of the current global crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2, the exchange of information within the scientific community should be quick and extremely transparent. Thus, this review presents the available information necessary for a general practitioner. Such presentation of data should allow the reader quick access to basic and crucial information related to epidemiology, viral transmission, clinical symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and complications that may occur in the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: Rapidly increasing amounts of information about the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 allow a better understanding of the etiology and course of the infection. In the current epidemiological situation, readily accessible information helps minimize the time to acquire knowledge and focus on prevention methods, diagnostic and treatment options. Thus, this review highlights key issues related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and contains the most useful data for daily medical practice.

AB  - Nintedanib is a synthetic orally active tyrosine kinase inhibitor, whose main action is to inhibit the receptors of the platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor families. The drug also affects other kinases, including Src, Flt-3, LCK, LYN. Nintedanib is used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases and lung cancer. The mechanism of action suggests that nintedanib should be considered one of the potential agents for inhibiting and revising the fibrosis process related to COVID-19 infections. Due to the known induction of coagulation pathways during COVID-19 infections, possible interaction between nintedanib and anticoagulant seems to be an extremely important issue. In theory, nintedanib could increase the bleeding risk, thrombosis and lead to thrombocytopenia. The data from clinical trials on the concomitant use of nintedanib and antithrombotic agents is very limited as this patient group was within the standard exclusion criteria. Nintedanib is an important therapeutic option, despite its interaction with anticoagulants. If anticoagulant therapy is necessary, the more effective and safer option is the concomitant administration of DOACs and nintedanib, especially when drug-monitored therapy will be used in patients at high risk of bleeding complications.

AB  - Kidneys are one of the targets for SARS-CoV-2, it is reported that up to 36% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection would develop into acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with high mortality in the clinical setting and contributes to the transition of AKI to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Up to date, the underlying mechanisms are obscure and there is no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19-induced AKI. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms and interactions between Quercetin and SARS-CoV-2 targets proteins by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The renal protective effects of Quercetin on COVID-19-induced AKI may be associated with the blockade of the activation of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways. Quercetin may also serve as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor by binding with the active sites of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL and ACE2, therefore suppressing the functions of the proteins to cut the viral life cycle. In conclusion, Quercetin may be a novel therapeutic agent for COVID-19-induced AKI. Inhibition of inflammatory, cell apoptosis-related signaling pathways may be the critical mechanisms by which Quercetin protects kidney from SARS-CoV-2 injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Face coverings constitute an important strategy for containing pandemics, such as COVID-19. Infection from airborne respiratory viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur in at least three modes; tiny and/or dried aerosols (typically < 1.0 μm) generated through multiple mechanisms including talking, breathing, singing, large droplets (> 0.5 μm) generated during coughing and sneezing, and macro drops transmitted via fomites. While there is a growing number of studies looking at the performance of household materials against some of these situations, to date, there has not been any systematic characterization of household materials against all three modes. METHODS: A three-step methodology was developed and used to characterize the performance of 21 different household materials with various material compositions (e.g. cotton, polyester, polypropylene, cellulose and blends) using submicron sodium chloride aerosols, water droplets, and mucous mimicking macro droplets over an aerosol-droplet size range of ~ 20 nm to 0.6 cm. RESULTS: Except for one thousand-thread-count cotton, most single-layered materials had filtration efficiencies < 20% for sub-micron solid aerosols. However, several of these materials stopped > 80% of larger droplets, even at sneeze-velocities of up to 1700 cm/s. Three or four layers of the same material, or combination materials, would be required to stop macro droplets from permeating out or into the face covering. Such materials can also be boiled for reuse. CONCLUSION: Four layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics independent of the composition (e.g. cotton, polyester, nylon or blends) are likely to be effective source controls. One layer of tightly woven fabrics combined with multiple layers of loosely knit or woven fabrics in addition to being source controls can have sub-micron filtration efficiencies > 40% and may offer some protection to the wearer. However, the pressure drop across such fabrics can be high (> 100 Pa).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Testing, traceability, and isolation (TTI strategy) actions are a central strategy defined by WHO to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In this sense, the countries have had difficulties in counting the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Errors in reporting results are a common factor, as well as the lack of interoperability between laboratories and governments. Approaches aimed at sending spreadsheets via email expose patients' privacy and have increased the probability of errors due to re-typing, which generates a delay in the notification of results. OBJECTIVE: Design and develop an interoperable platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government. METHODS: The methodology to design and develop the interoperable platform comprised six well-structured stages: 1) Creation of a minimum dataset for PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, 2) Modeling processes and endpoints where institutions interchange information, 3) Standards and interoperability design, 4) Software development, 5) Software testing and 6) Software implementation. RESULTS: The main result was that the interoperable FHIR platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government was successfully implemented. The platform was designed, developed, tested, and implemented following a structured methodology. The platform's performance to 1,000 requests resulted in a response time of 240 milliseconds, throughput was 28.3 requests per second, and the process management time was 131 milliseconds. The security was assured through a private network exclusive for the Ministry of Health to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The authorization and authentication of laboratories were implemented with JSON Web Token (JWT). All the PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests were accessible through an Application Programming Interface (API) gateway with valid credentials and the right access control list. CONCLUSIONS: The platform was implemented and is currently being used by UC Christus Laboratory. The platform is secure. It was tested adequately for confidentiality, secure authorization, authentication, and message integrity. This platform simplifies the reporting of PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and reduces the time and probability of mistakes in counting positive cases. The interoperable solution with FHIR is working successfully and is open for the community, laboratories, and any institution that needs to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests.

AB  - This study aims to find the association between short-term exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matters and ground-level ozone, and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases. Generalized linear models (GLM), a typical choice for ecological modeling, have well-established limitations. These limitations include apriori assumptions, inability to handle multicollinearity, and considering differential effects as the fixed effect. We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 μg/m3, 1 μg/m3, and 1 ppm increase (lag 0-7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51 % (CI: -7.01 to -2.00) decrease, 1.62 % (CI: -2.23 to -1.022) decrease, and 4.66 % (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well. The results reiterate the significance of uniformly adhering to air pollution mitigation strategies, especially related to ground-level ozone.

AB  - IL-6 promotes T cell activation and production in acute inflammatory conditions, initiates B cell differentiation, regulates liver production of acute phase reactants, and stimulates hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system, which is important in acute inflammation. Nevertheless prolonged IL-6 exposition activates apoptosis. According to recent studies increased levels of IL-6 increase cardiovascular disease risks. The aim of the study was to explore IL-6 basic levels in chronic congestive heart failure patients, as in risk group in COVID-19, and various factors (demographic or clinical) in various groups of IL-6 basic levels. We used consecutive sampling approach to recruit 96 congestive heart failure patients and 34 persons without the condition as controls. Hematologic, biochemical and immunologic parameters were measured using conventional methods. We used descriptive statistics for demographic parameters. We compared mean values of hematologic and biochemical parameters in cases and controls using independent sample t test and explored differences within the congestive heart failure group (further separated in 3 groups according to IL-6 levels) using one way ANOVA test, with further post-hoc analysis. Levels of IL-6 are statistically significantly higher in CHF patients; groups differ in co-morbidity, also abdominal obesity is more prevalent in diseased group. Difference between groups is significant in a number of pro-inflammation, coagulation, hematology parameters. It is also important to note that the CHF group showed a number of differences in sub-groups according to IL-6 levels, risks of CHF and comorbidity deterioration risks therefore are suggested to be different.

AB  - As the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 related pandemic - Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged, decision making in the context of cancer treatment has become more complex. The apprehension of using drugs that could adversely affect infected patients, the risk of not using life-saving treatments and the complexities related to the type of cancer itself, all must be taken into consideration before proceeding with treatment. Data from large registries such as COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium, Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration (TERAVOLT) and NCI COVID-19 in Cancer Patients Study will hopefully provide granularity on the outcomes of patients with cancer who are infected with COVID-19. As these efforts are underway, this review aims to shed light on the management of patients with genitourinary malignancies being treated with systemic therapies while infected with COVID-19.

AB  - Two pandemics of respiratory distress diseases associated with zoonotic introductions of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in the human population during 21st century raised unprecedented interest in coronavirus research and assigned it unseen urgency. The two viruses responsible for the outbreaks, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are in the spotlight, and SARS-CoV-2 is the focus of the current fast-paced research. Its foundation was laid down by studies of many corona- and related viruses that collectively form the vast order Nidovirales. Comparative genomics of nidoviruses played a key role in this advancement over more than 30 years. It facilitated the transfer of knowledge from characterized to newly identified viruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as contributed to the dissection of the nidovirus proteome and identification of patterns of variations between different taxonomic groups, from species to families. This review revisits selected cases of protein conservation and variation that define nidoviruses, illustrates the remarkable plasticity of the proteome during nidovirus adaptation, and asks questions at the interface of the proteome and processes that are vital for nidovirus reproduction and could inform the ongoing research of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background: Recently, SARS-CoV-2 virus with the D614G mutation has become a public concern due to rapid dissemination of this variant across many countries. Our study aims were (1) to report full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 collected from four COVID-19 patients in the Special Region of Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia; (2) to compare the clade distribution of full-length genome sequences from Indonesia (n = 60) from March to September 2020 and (3) to perform phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from different countries, including Indonesia. Methods: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) applied in the Illumina MiSeq instrument. Full-length virus genomes were annotated using the reference genome of hCoV-19/Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 (NC_045512.2) and then visualized in UGENE v. 1.30. For phylogenetic analysis, a dataset of 88 available SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from different countries, including Indonesia, was retrieved from GISAID. Results: All patients were hospitalized with various severities of COVID-19. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one and three virus samples belong to clade L and GH. These three clade GH virus samples (EPI_ISL_525492, EPI_ISL_516800 and EPI_ISL_516829) were not only located in a cluster with SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Asia but also those from Europe, whereas the clade L virus sample (EPI_ISL_516806) was located amongst SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Asia. Using full-length sequences available in the GISAID EpiCoV Database, 39 of 60 SARS-CoV-2 (65%) from Indonesia harbor the D614G mutation. Conclusion: These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 with the D614G mutation appears to become the major circulating virus in Indonesia, concurrent with the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

AB  - Background: There is a need for validated and standardized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quantitative immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralization assays that can be used to understand the immunology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic response. Methods: Literature searches were conducted to identify English language publications from peer-reviewed journals and preprints from January 2020 through November 6, 2020. Relevant publications were reviewed for mention of IgG or neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2, or both, and the methods of reporting assay results. Results: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG results have been reported from a limited number of studies; most studies used in-house laboratory-developed tests in limited settings, and only two semiquantitative tests have received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). As of November 6, 2020, there is only one SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay with FDA EUA. Relatively few studies have attempted correlation of quantitative IgG titers with neutralization results to estimate surrogates of protection. The number of individuals tested is small compared with the magnitude of the pandemic, and persons tested are not representative of disproportionately affected populations. Methods of reporting quantitative results are not standardized to enable comparisons and meta-analyses. Conclusions: Lack of standardized SARS-CoV-2 quantitative IgG and neutralization assays precludes comparison of results from published studies. Interassay and interlaboratory validation and standardization of assays will support efforts to better understand antibody kinetics and longevity of humoral immune responses postillness, surrogates of immune protection, and vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Public-private partnerships could facilitate realization of these advances in the United States and worldwide.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses an unprecedented public health crisis. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of the immune system. However, the unique signature of early immune responses remains elusive. We characterized the transcriptome of rhesus macaques and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Alarmin S100A8 was robustly induced in SARS-CoV-2-infected animal models as well as in COVID-19 patients. Paquinimod, a specific inhibitor of S100A8/A9, could rescue the pneumonia with substantial reduction of viral loads in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Remarkably, Paquinimod treatment resulted in almost 100% survival in a lethal model of mouse coronavirus infection using the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). A group of neutrophils that contributes to the uncontrolled pathological damage and onset of COVID-19 was dramatically induced by coronavirus infection. Paquinimod treatment could reduce these neutrophils and regain anti-viral responses, unveiling key roles of S100A8/A9 and aberrant neutrophils in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Multiple driver genes in individual patient samples may cause resistance to individual drugs in precision medicine. However, current computational methods have not studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver gene identification and combinatorial drug discovery for individual patients. Here, we developed a novel structural network controllability-based personalized driver genes and combinatorial drug identification algorithm (CPGD), aiming to identify combinatorial drugs for an individual patient by targeting personalized driver genes from network controllability perspective. On two benchmark disease datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs. Furthermore, CPGD enhanced cancer subtyping by computationally providing personalized side effect signatures for individual patients. In addition, CPGD identified 90 drug combinations candidates from SARS-COV2 dataset as potential drug repurposing candidates for recently spreading COVID-19.

AB  - The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led the world to a standstill, causing a medical and economic crisis worldwide. This crisis has triggered an urgent need to discover a possible treatment strategy against this novel virus using already-approved drugs. The main protease (Mpro) of this virus plays a critical role in cleaving the translated polypeptides that makes it a potential drug target against COVID-19. Taking advantage of the recently discovered three-dimensional structure of Mpro, we screened approved drugs from the Drug Bank to find a possible inhibitor against Mpro using computational methods and further validating them with biochemical studies. The docking and molecular dynamics study revealed that DB04983 (denufosol) showed the best glide docking score, -11.884 kcal/mol, and MM-PBSA binding free energy, -10.96 kcal/mol. Cobicistat, cangrelor (previous computational studies in our lab), and denufosol (current study) were tested for the in vitro inhibitory effects on Mpro. The IC50 values of these drugs were ∼6.7 μM, 0.9 mM, and 1.3 mM, respectively, while the values of dissociation constants calculated using surface plasmon resonance were ∼2.1 μM, 0.7 mM, and 1.4 mM, respectively. We found that cobicistat is the most efficient inhibitor of Mpro both in silico and in vitro. In conclusion, cobicistat, which is already an FDA-approved drug being used against HIV, may serve as a good inhibitor against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 that, in turn, can help in combating COVID-19, and these results can also form the basis for the rational structure-based drug design against COVID-19.

AB  - Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) remains a common medical emergency, with 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis experiencing at least one event in their disease course. Despite advances in medical therapy, ASUC continues to be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, with up to 30% of patients requiring colectomy during initial admission. Our aim was to review the current controversies and recent progress in risk stratification, prediction of outcome, and personalisation of care in ASUC. We re-assess the use of Truelove and Witts' criteria, serum biomarkers and the use of composite clinical indices in current clinical practice. We explore the potential for endoscopic prediction using defined validated indices for accurate and early prognostication, and the need to define outcome. We also consider the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we discuss the current research agenda including the application of new and emerging biomarkers coupled with multi-omics and the implications in management and optimisation of outcome.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly pathogenic member of family coronaviridae, has caused an exponentially growing global pandemic termed as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 12 million cases worldwide till date. This deadly disease has average fatality rate of 6.5% and even higher among elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as the entry receptor into host cell. ACE-2, a type-I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase, is a critical regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells results in a reduced availability of ACE-2 on the host cell surface followed by significant downregulation of ACE-2 gene expression. As ACE-2 is a well-known cardio-protective molecule, its downregulation could result in severe cardiac disorders. This review deals with a challenging aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are asymptomatic or have mild syndromes similar to influenza infections. These patients are proving to be the Achilles' heel to combat COVID-19 mainly in developing countries of South Asia, where the average number of tests conducted per million individuals is considerably low. Consequently, there is high possibility that individuals with negligible respiratory trouble will not be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, a huge percentage of the population have the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders as a bystander effect of viral infection apart from being potential reservoir of disease transmission. Based on available demographic as well as molecular data, this review predicts a huge spike in cardiovascular disorders among this undetected reservoir in post COVID-19 era.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 consists of several enzymes with essential functions within its proteome. Here, we focused on repurposing approved and investigational drugs/compounds. We targeted seven proteins with enzymatic activities known to be essential at different stages of the viral cycle including PLpro, 3CLpro, RdRP, Helicase, ExoN, NendoU, and 2'-O-MT. For virtual screening, energy minimization of a crystal structure of the modeled protein was carried out using the Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrodinger LLC 2020-1). Following active site selection based on data mining and COACH predictions, we performed a high-throughput virtual screen of drugs and investigational molecules (n=5903). The screening was performed against viral targets using three sequential docking modes (i.e., HTVS, SP, and XP). Virtual screening identified ∼290 potential inhibitors based on the criteria of energy, docking parameters, ligand, and binding site strain and score. Drugs specific to each target protein were further analyzed for binding free energy perturbation by molecular mechanics (prime MM-GBSA) and pruning the hits to the top 32 candidates. The top lead from each target pool was further subjected to molecular dynamics simulation using the Desmond module. The resulting top eight hits were tested for their SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral activity in-vitro. Among these, a known inhibitor of protein kinase C isoforms, Bisindolylmaleimide IX (BIM IX), was found to be a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Further, target validation through enzymatic assays confirmed 3CLpro to be the target. This is the first study that has showcased BIM IX as a COVID-19 inhibitor thereby validating our pipeline.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has provided medical students around the globe with unique challenges and opportunities. With formal medical school education and training interrupted, medical students sought innovative ways to contribute to their health-care systems and communities. Their responses could be organized into three categories: clinical (remote clinical care and triage, helping in COVID testing or treatment centers, and contact tracing), nonclinical (PPE acquisition, COVID-related policy and research, and supporting vulnerable groups in the community), and educational (creating materials to educate peers, the community, or community health workers). We present examples of responses developed by students from five countries: Brazil, Nepal, the Philippines, Rwanda, and the United States. We discuss the challenges, outcomes, and recommendations for each case. One critical opportunity for growth is strengthening international collaborations. We hope that these examples provide a framework for medical students to plan coordinated and effective responses to the next pandemic, and further medical student engagement in international collaboration.

AB  - The human SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1, China. Out of 10 333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human ACE-2 receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID-19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 a interacting distance from the ACE-2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three-dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine and drug development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a severe acute respiratory condition requiring respiratory support and mechanical ventilation. Based on the pathophysiology and clinical course of the disease, a therapeutic approach can be adapted. Three phases have been identified, in which different strategies are recommended in a stepwise invasiveness approach. In the second or acute phase, patients are frequently admitted to the ICU for severe pneumonia and hypoxemia with evidence of a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state. This stage is an opportunity to intervene early in the disease. Medical strategies and mechanical ventilation should be individualized to improve outcomes.

Support-people, such as family members, friends even religious leaders, often play a vital part of the care team for patients. The presence of a support-person can bring relief and comfort to a patient. However, COVID-19, District Health Boards severely restricted visits to hospital patients, and one even excluded all support-people unless there were exceptional and compassionate circumstances. This article explores whether the limitations placed on support-people and visitors' access to hospitals were proportionate and legally justifiable.

AB  - Azithromycin has rapidly been adopted as a repurposed drug for the treatment of COVID-19, despite the lack of high-quality evidence. In this review, we critically appraise the current pharmacological, preclinical and clinical data of azithromycin for treating COVID-19. Interest in azithromycin has been fuelled by favourable treatment outcomes in other viral pneumonias, a documented antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and uncontrolled case series early in the pandemic. Its antiviral effects presumably result from interfering with receptor mediated binding, viral lysosomal escape, intracellular cell-signalling pathways and enhancing type I and III interferon expression. Its immunomodulatory effects may mitigate excessive inflammation and benefit tissue repair. Currently, in vivo reports on azithromycin in COVID-19 are conflicting and do not endorse its widespread use outside of clinical trials. They are, however, mostly retrospective and therefore inherently biased. The effect size of azithromycin may depend on when it is started. Also, extended follow-up is needed to assess benefits in the recovery phase. Safety data warrant monitoring of drug-drug interactions and subsequent cardiac adverse events, especially with hydroxychloroquine. More prospective data of large randomised controlled studies are expected and much-needed. Uniform reporting of results should be strongly encouraged to facilitate data pooling with the many ongoing initiatives.

AB  - Endothelial injury and microvascular/macrovascular thrombosis are common pathophysiologic features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, the optimal thromboprophylactic regimens remain unknown across the spectrum of illness severity of COVID-19. A variety of antithrombotic agents, doses and durations of therapy are being assessed in ongoing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focus on outpatients, hospitalized patients in medical wards, and critically-ill patients with COVID-19. This manuscript provides a perspective of the ongoing or completed RCTs related to antithrombotic strategies used in COVID-19, the opportunities and challenges for the clinical trial enterprise, and areas of existing knowledge, as well as data gaps that may motivate the design of future RCTs.

AB  - Rapid antigen-detecting tests (Ag-RDTs) can complement molecular diagnostics for COVID-19. The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 5-30°C. In many countries that would benefit from SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, mean temperatures exceed 30°C. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including (i) long-term storage and testing at recommended conditions, (ii) recommended storage conditions followed by 10 minutes exposure to 37°C and testing at 37°C and (iii) 3 weeks storage followed by testing at 37°C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 8.2x105-7.9x107 genome copies/ml of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 minutes pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37°C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for 46% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37°C, 73% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture-derived human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was not affected by storage and testing at 37°C. In summary, short- and long-term exposure to elevated temperatures likely impairs sensitivity of several SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that may translate to false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with inter-individual transmission. Ensuring appropriate transport and storage conditions, and development of tests that are more robust across temperature fluctuations will be important for accurate use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs in tropical settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is based on research funded in part by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (grant ID INV-005971).

AB  - The worldwide pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in over 84,407,000 cases with over 1,800,000 deaths when this paper was submitted, with comorbidities such as gender, race, age, body mass, diabetes, and hypertension greatly exacerbating mortality. This review will analyze the rapidly increasing knowledge of COVID-19 induced lung pathophysiology. Although controversial, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 (CARDS) seems to present as two distinct phenotypes: Type-L and Type-H. The 'L' refers to Low elastance, ventilation/perfusion ratio, lung weight, and recruitability, and the 'H' refers to High pulmonary elastance, shunt, edema, and recruitability. However, the LUNG SAFE and ESICM Trials Groups has shown that ~13% of the mechanically ventilated non-COVID-19 ARDS patients have the Type-L phenotype. However, other studies have shown that CARDS and ARDS respiratory mechanics overlap and that standard ventilation strategies apply to these patients. The mechanisms causing alterations in pulmonary perfusion could be caused by some combination of: 1) renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation, 2) thrombosis caused by loss of endothelial barrier, 3) endothelial dysfunction causing loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) perfusion control, and 4) hyper-perfusion of collapsed lung tissue that has been directly measured and supported by a computational model. A flow chart has been constructed highlighting the need for personalized and adaptive ventilation strategies, such as the time controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method to set and adjust the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode, which recently was shown effective at improving oxygenation and reducing FiO2, vasopressors, and sedation in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 90% of students worldwide were affected by education loss. Moreover, for school-age children and adolescents, there may be worsening of nutrition, increasing mental health disorders, lack of physical activity, and related deleterious consequences raise concerns about negative habits, child violence, and abuse. Face-to-face education in schools provides positive educational opportunities that cannot be achieved with online education. In studies from various countries, children have milder disease, constituting as little as 1-8% of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, with less transmission capacity to household contacts than adults (0.5-7% vs. 10-20%). Symptomatic or asymptomatic children can infect other people less than adults. Also, the transmission of illness between students at school is less than expected, and the transmission of COVID-19 to students is usually acquired from sick adults rather than sick students. Therefore, with suitable measures, infection risk is less than expected and seems not to be higher than in other public places. COVID-19 measures in schools can be summarized as follows: avoiding crowded/close contact environments as much as possible, respecting the protective (social) distance, wearing appropriate masks, hand hygiene, and some essential protective measurements of classrooms and environment. Measurements should be participatory (students, teachers, education staff, parents, administration), applicable, sustainable, and flexible according to the conditions.

AB  - Given that COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has crept into Africa, a major public health crisis or threat continues to linger on the continent. Many local governments and various stakeholders have stepped up efforts for early detection and management of COVID-19. This mini review highlights the current trend in Africa, history and general epidemiological information on the virus. Current ongoing efforts (e.g., improving testing capacity) and some effective ways (e.g., intensified surveillance, quick detection, contact tracing, isolation measures [e.g., quarantine], and social distancing) of preventing and managing COVID-19 in Africa are described. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for public health infrastructure development (e.g., laboratories, infectious disease centers, regional hospitals) and human capacity building for combating COVID-19 and potential future outbreaks. Additionally, regular public health educational campaigns are urgently required. Future epidemiological studies to ascertain case fatality and mortality trends across the continent for policy directions are necessary.

AB  - Over 10,000 viral genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2virus have been made readily available during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic since the initial genome sequence of the virus was released on the open access Virological website (http://virological.org/) early on January 11. We utilize the published data on the single stranded RNAs of 11,132 SARS-CoV-2 patients in the GISAID database, which contains fully or partially sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from laboratories around the world. Among many important research questions which are currently being investigated, one aspect pertains to the genetic characterization/classification of the virus. We analyze data on the nucleotide sequencing of the virus and geographic information of a subset of 7640 SARS-CoV-2 patients without missing entries that are available in the GISAID database. Instead of modeling the mutation rate, applying phylogenetic tree approaches, and so forth, we here utilize a model-free clustering approach that compares the viruses at a genome-wide level. We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index. Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. This is in line with a phylogenetic analysis which we use to contrast our results. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups. It is the subject of ongoing research to examine whether the genetic subgroup could be related to diseases outcome and its potential implications for vaccine development.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a ubiquitous receptor that interacts with the virus' surface S glycoprotein. Recent reports show that the virus affects the central nervous system (CNS) with symptoms and complications that include dizziness, altered consciousness, encephalitis, and even stroke. These can immerge as indirect immune effects due to increased cytokine production or via direct viral entry into brain tissue. The latter is possible through neuronal access via the olfactory bulb, hematogenous access through immune cells or directly across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and through the brain's circumventricular organs characterized by their extensive and highly permeable capillaries. Last, the COVID-19 pandemic increases stress, depression, and anxiety within infected individuals, those in isolation, and high-risk populations like children, the elderly, and health workers. This review surveys the recent updates of CNS manifestations post SARS-CoV-2 infection along with possible mechanisms that lead to them.

AB  - Despite decades of research establishing the importance of breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact and mother-infant closeness, the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the hidden assumption that these practices can be dispensed with no consequences to mother or child. This article aims to support shared decision-making process for infant feeding and care with parents and health care providers during the unprecedented times of the pandemic. It proposes a structure and rationale to guide the process that includes (1) discussing with parents evidence-based information and the different options to feed and care for an infant and young child in the context of the pandemic as well as their potential benefits, risks and scientific uncertainties; (2) helping parents to recognize the sensitive nature of the decisions and to clarify the value they place on the different options to feed and care for their infant or young child; and (3) providing guidance and support needed to make and implement their decisions. A shared decision-making process will help parents navigate complex feeding and care decisions for their child as we face the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the world of sports due to periods of home quarantine, bans against public gatherings, travel restrictions, and a large number of postponed or canceled major sporting events. The literature hitherto is sparse, but early indications display signs of psychological impact on elite athletes due to the pandemic. However, beyond acute effects from lockdown and short-term interrupted athletic seasons, the postponed and still uncertain Olympic and Paralympic Games may represent a major career insecurity to many athletes world-wide, and may lead to severe changes to everyday lives and potentially prolonged psychological distress. Given the long-term perspective of these changes, researchers and stakeholders should address mental health and long-term job insecurity in athletes, including a specific focus on those with small financial margins, such as many female athletes, parasports athletes, athletes in smaller sports, and athletes from developing countries. Implications and the need for research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Concerns have been raised about increased gambling problems during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, particularly in settings with high online gambling and risks of migration from land-based to riskier online-based gambling types. However, few non-self-reported data sources are hitherto available. The present study aimed to assess changes in the online- and land-based gambling markets in Sweden during the first months affected by the societal impact of COVID-19. Methods: Data were derived from national authority data describing monthly taxations of all licensed Swedish gambling operators, whose monthly tax payments are directly based on gambling revenue. Subdivisions of the gambling market were followed monthly from before COVID-19 onset in Sweden (mainly February 2020) through June 2020, when the sports market was restarted after COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Overall revenue-based taxations in the licensed gambling decreased markedly from February to March, but stabilized onto an overall modest decrease through June. Commercial online casino/betting, despite some decrease in March, was maintained on a relatively stable level through June. However, within this category, horse betting increased steeply during the pandemic but returned to prepandemic levels later during the period. The state-owned operator in betting/online casino decreased markedly throughout the pandemic. The remaining commercial operators, mainly in online casino and online betting, demonstrated no change during the pandemic and ended on a June level 14% above the February level. Throughout the pandemic, the smaller restaurant casinos decreased markedly, while major state-owned casinos also closed entirely. State-owned lotteries and electronic gambling machines decreased markedly but were rapidly normalized to prepandemic levels. Conclusions: Commercial online gambling operators' revenues remained stable throughout the pandemic, despite the dramatic lockdown in sports. Thus, chance-based online games may have remained a strong actor in the gambling market despite the COVID-19 crisis, in line with previous self-report data. A sudden increase in horse betting during the sports lockdown and its decrease when sports reopened confirm the picture of possible COVID-19-related migration between gambling types, indicating a volatility with potential impact on gambling-related public health.

AB  - Network theory-based approaches provide valuable insights into the variations in global structural connectivity between different dynamical states of proteins. Our objective is to review network-based analyses to elucidate such variations, especially in the context of subtle conformational changes. We present technical details of the construction and analyses of protein structure networks, encompassing both the non-covalent connectivity and dynamics. We examine the selection of optimal criteria for connectivity based on the physical concept of percolation. We highlight the advantages of using side-chain-based network metrics in contrast to backbone measurements. As an illustrative example, we apply the described network approach to investigate the global conformational changes between the closed and partially open states of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These conformational changes in the spike protein is crucial for coronavirus entry and fusion into human cells. Our analysis reveals global structural reorientations between the two states of the spike protein despite small changes between the two states at the backbone level. We also observe some differences at strategic locations in the structures, correlating with their functions, asserting the advantages of the side-chain network analysis. Finally, we present a view of allostery as a subtle synergistic-global change between the ligand and the receptor, the incorporation of which would enhance drug design strategies.

AB  - COVID-19 has stressed the healthcare system in ways our society has not seen before. Less visibly, elderly patients and their caregivers have been stressed as well, both by the virus and by the public health measures required to slow its spread. After months of isolating, patients with dementia and their caregivers are worried about reentering a society with different rules and expectations. Although an extremely complex topic, the re-entry of individuals with cognitive impairment back into society is critical for both the wellbeing of the person as well as the caregiver. Successful re-entry into society will vary based on a person's interests and baseline cognition, however, the ability to participate in activities and events that previously provided joy and stimulation is the first step. This paper, written by practicing geriatricians and palliative clinicians, offers some concrete counseling strategies and tips for caregivers to help navigate re-entry into society with their loved ones.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the major changes that has occurred in emergency medicine is the evolution of telemedicine. With relaxation of regulatory and administrative barriers, the use of this already available technology has rapidly expanded. Telemedicine provides opportunity to markedly decrease personal protective equipment (PPE) and reduce healthcare worker exposures. Moreover, with the convenience and availability of access to medical care via telemedicine, a more fundamental change in healthcare delivery in the United States is likely. The implementation of telemedicine in the emergency department (ED) in particular has great potential to prevent the iatrogenic spread of COVID-19 and protect health care workers. Challenges to widespread adoption of telemedicine include privacy concerns, limitation of physical examination, and concerns of patient experience. In this clinical review, we discuss ED telemedicine applications, logistics, and challenges in the COVID-19 era as well as recent regulatory and legal changes. In addition, examples of telemedicine use are described from 2 institutions. Examples of future applications of telemedicine within the realm of emergency medicine are also discussed.

AB  - Macrodomains are proteins that recognize and hydrolyze ADP ribose (ADPR) modifications of intracellular proteins. Macrodomains are implicated in viral genome replication and interference with host cell immune responses. They are important to the infectious cycle of Coronaviridae and Togaviridae viruses. We describe crystal structures of the conserved macrodomain from the bat coronavirus (CoV) HKU4 in complex with ligands. The structures reveal a binding cavity that accommodates ADPR and analogs via local structural changes within the pocket. Using a radioactive assay, we present evidence of mono-ADPR (MAR) hydrolase activity. In silico analysis presents further evidence on recognition of the ADPR modification for hydrolysis. Mutational analysis of residues within the binding pocket resulted in diminished enzymatic activity and binding affinity. We conclude that the common structural features observed in the macrodomain in a bat CoV contribute to a conserved function that can be extended to other known macrodomains.

AB  - Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and poses a threat to humanity. However, no specific therapy has been established for this disease yet. We conducted a systematic review to highlight therapeutic agents that might be effective in treating COVID-19. Methods: We searched Medline, Medrxiv.org, and reference lists of relevant publications to identify articles of in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 published in English until the last update on October 11, 2020. Results: We included 36 studies on SARS, 30 studies on MERS, and 10 meta-analyses on SARS and MERS in this study. Through 12,200 title and 830 full-text screenings for COVID-19, eight in vitro studies, 46 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on 6,886 patients, and 29 meta-analyses were obtained and investigated. There was no therapeutic agent that consistently resulted in positive outcomes across SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Remdesivir showed a therapeutic effect for COVID-19 in two RCTs involving the largest number of total participants (n = 1,461). Other therapies that showed an effect in at least two RCTs for COVID-19 were sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (n = 114), colchicine (n = 140), IFN-β1b (n = 193), and convalescent plasma therapy (n = 126). Conclusions: This review provides information to help establish treatment and research directions for COVID-19 based on currently available evidence. Further RCTs are required.

AB  - A coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading widely through person-to-person transmission. Various detection approaches have been developed involving quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods, CRISPR-based systems, and direct targeting of specific coronavirus proteins. However, there have only been a few reports on the detection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the primer-independent RNA-replicable protein produced by the RNA genes of coronavirus. Here, we introduce a novel diagnostic methodology for COVID-19 using the RNA-directed and de novo RNA replicable function of RdRP. We devised an RNA platform for RdRP-induced transcription (RPRIT) that includes an RNA template that can be directly transcribed by RdRP. By utilizing RPRIT, the presence of RdRP can be readily confirmed within 30 min using isothermal incubation without PCR. This RdRP detection method can provide a new route for rapid diagnosis of RNA virus-infected patients.

AB  - Initially, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was considered as a pneumonia virus; however, a series of peer reviewed medical papers published in the last eight months suggest that this virus attacks the brain, heart, intestine, nervous and vascular systems, as well the blood stream. Although many facts remain unknown, an objective appraisal of the current scientific literature addressing the latest progress on COVID-19 is required. The aim of the present study was to conduct a critical review of the literature, focusing on the current molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 and prospective treatment modalities of COVID-19. The main objectives were to collect, scrutinize and objectively evaluate the current scientific evidence-based information, as well to provide an updated overview of the topic that is ongoing. The authors underlined potential prospective therapies, including vaccine and phototherapy, as a monotherapy or combined with current treatment modalities. The authors concluded that this review has produced high quality evidence, which can be utilized by the clinical scientific community for future reference, as the knowledge and understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are evolving, in terms of its epidemiological, pathogenicity, and clinical manifestations, which ultimately map the strategic path, towards an effective and safe treatment and production of a reliable and potent vaccine.

AB  - Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in medical practice accounting from 8-18% of hospitalized patients. However, although it has been well-established that AKI is linked to increased mortality in hospitalized patients, whether this knowledge would extend to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients remained unanswered. Thus, this study aimed to determine the incidence of AKI and its association with mortality in COVID-19 patients from available literatures using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We search Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for eligible publications reporting the clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 patients without language restriction. Incidence of AKI and mortality were reported. Because COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic, a large number of studies were published within a short period of time. Valid Institutional Review Board (IRB) number or approval by the National Health Commission of that country were screened to avoid studies with duplicated patients' population. Results: From 26 studies (n = 5,497), the pooled incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 8.4% (95% CI, 6.0-11.7) with a pooled incidence of renal replacement therapy of 3.6% (95% CI, 1.8-7.1). The incidence of AKI was higher in critically ill patients (19.9%) compared to hospitalized patients (7.3%). Critically ill patients had higher mortality than hospitalized patients. (33% vs. 16.1%, respectively). The pooled estimated unadjusted odds ratio for mortality from AKI was 13.33 (95% CI, 4.05-43.91). By using meta-regression analyses, the incidence of AKI was positively associated with mortality in an adjusted model (Q 26.18; p = 0.02). Moreover, our adjusted model showed that age (p < 0.01), diabetes (p = 0.02), hypertension (p < 0.01) and baseline serum creatinine levels (p = 0.04) were positively associated with the incidence of AKI. Conclusions: AKI is present in 8.3% of overall COVID-19 patients and in 19.9% of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Presence of AKI is associated with 13-fold increased risk of mortality. Age, diabetes, hypertension, and baseline serum creatinine levels are associated with increased AKI incidence. More studies, including the ones from multinational databases, are encouraged to confirm our findings. [This record is from Embase.com and was provided under license by Elsevier.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated both positive and negative effects on the environment. Major concerns over personal hygiene, mandated and ease in lockdown actions and slackening of some policy measures have led to a massive surge in the use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastic items. This generated an enormous amount of plastic waste from both healthcare and household units, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Apart from the healthcare workers, the general public have become accustomed to using PPE. These habits are threatening the land and marine environment with immense loads of plastic waste, due to improper disposal practices across the world, especially in developing nations. Contaminated PPE has already made its way to the oceans which will inevitably produce plastic particles alongside other pathogen-driven diseases. This study provided an estimation-based approach in quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of 3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations. Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and policy makers to design effective response plans. Sustainable plastic waste management for the current and post-pandemic period can be imagined and acted upon.

AB  - An infectious disease, COVID-19, caused by a new type of coronavirus, has been discovered recently. This disease can cause respiratory distress, fever, and fatigue. It still has no drug and vaccine for treatment and prevention. Therefore, WHO recommends that people should stay at home to reduce disease transmission. Due to the quarantine, FDA stated that this could hamper drug development clinical trial protocols. Hence, an alternative sampling method that can be applied at home is needed. Currently, volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) has become attention in its use in clinical and bioanalytical fields. This paper discusses the advantages and challenges that might be found in the use of VAMS as an alternative sampling tool in clinical trials and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. VAMS allows easy sampling, can be done at home, storage and delivery at room temperature, and the volume taken is small and minimally invasive. VAMS is also able to absorb a fixed volume that can increase the accuracy and precision of analytical methods, and reduce the hematocrit effects (HCT). The use of VAMS is expected to be implemented immediately in clinical trials and TDM during this pandemic considering the benefits it has.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing is commonly performed in patients with COVID-19. Each of the laboratory parameters has potential value for risk stratification and prediction of COVID-19 outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the difference between these parameters in severe and nonsevere disease and to provide the optimal cutoff value for predicting severe disease. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search through electronic databases. The variables of interest were serum procalcitonin, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in each group of severity outcomes from COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 4848 patients from 23 studies. Our meta-analysis suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 infections have higher procalcitonin, (mean difference 0.07; 95% CI 0.05-0.10; p < 0.00001), CRP (mean difference 36.88; 95% CI 29.10-44.65; p < 0.00001), D-Dimer (mean difference 0.43; 95% CI 0.31-0.56; p < 0.00001), and LDH (mean difference 102.79; 95% CI 79.10-126.49; p < 0.00001) but lower levels of albumin (mean difference -4.58; 95% CI -5.76 to -3.39; p < 0.00001) than those with nonsevere COVID-19 infections. The cutoff values for the parameters were 0.065 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 38.85 g/L for albumin, 33.55 mg/L for CRP, 0.635 μ/L for D-dimer, and 263.5 U/L for LDH, each with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests elevated procalcitonin, CRP, D-dimer, and LDH and decreased albumin can be used for predicting severe outcomes in COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the data regarding the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab as treatment for COVID-19 infection is still conflicting. This study aims to give clear evidence regarding the potential benefit and safety of tocilizumab in improving the outcome of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until November 1st, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and tocilizumab were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies with a total of 13 412 COVID-19 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that tocilizumab treatment is associated with reduction of mortality rate from COVID-19 [OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.42-0.71), p<0.00001, I2=79%, random-effect modelling], but did not alter the severity of COVID-19 [OR 1.05 (95% CI 0.92-1.20), p=0.47, I2=84%, random-effect modelling] and length of hospital stay [Mean Difference 1.77 days (95% CI -0.61-4.14 days), p=0.15, I2=97%, random-effect modelling]. Tocilizumab also does not associated with serious adverse events compared with standard of care treatment [OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.71-1.15), p=0.42, I2=46%, random-effect modelling]. CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the routine use of tocilizumab for COVID-19 patients. Future studies should focus more on other potential therapies for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Importance: Postdischarge video-based virtual visits are a growing aspect of surgical care and have dramatically increased in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of all-cause 30-day hospital encounter proportion among patients who have a postdischarge video-based virtual visit follow-up compared with in-person follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, active, controlled noninferiority trial in an urban setting, including patients from a small community hospital and a large, tertiary care hospital. Patients who underwent minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy by a group of surgeons who cover emergency general surgery at these 2 hospitals were included. Patients undergoing elective and nonelective procedures were included. Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to video-based virtual visit or in-person visit. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome is the percentage of patients with 30-day hospital encounter, and we hypothesized that there would not be a significant increase in the 30-day hospital encounter proportion for patients who receive video-based virtual postdischarge care compared with patients who receive standard (in-person) care. Hospital encounter includes emergency department visit, observation, or inpatient admission. Results: A total of 1645 patients were screened; 289 patients were randomized to the virtual group and 143 to the in-person group. Fifty-three patients crossed over to the in-person follow-up group. The percentage of patients who had a hospital encounter was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs 13.3% for in-person, Δ 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 5.2%). The amount of time patients spent with the clinician (mean of 8.4 minutes virtual vs 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30) was not different, but the median overall postoperative visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter (95% CI, -33.5 to -24.0). Conclusions and Relevance: Postdischarge video-based virtual visits did not increase hospital encounter proportions and provided shorter overall time commitment but equal time with the surgical team member. This information will help surgeons and patients feel more confident in using video-based virtual visits. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03258177.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) created unparalleled challenges to anatomy education. Gross anatomy education has been particularly impacted given the traditional in-person format of didactic instruction and/or laboratory component. To assess changes in gross anatomy lecture and laboratory instruction, assessment, and teaching resources utilized as a result of Covid-19, a survey was distributed to gross anatomy educators through professional associations and listservs. Of the 67 survey responses received for the May-August 2020 academic period, 84% were from United States (US) institutions, while 16% were internationally based. Respondents indicated that in-person lecture decreased during Covid-19 (before: 76%, during: 8%, P < 0.001) and use of cadaver material declined (before: 76 ±33%, during: 34 ±43%, P < 0.001). The use of cadaver materials in laboratories decreased during Covid-19 across academic programs, stand-alone and integrated anatomy courses, and private and public institutions (P ≤ 0.004). Before Covid-19, cadaveric materials used in laboratories were greater among professional health programs relative to medical and undergraduate programs (P ≤ 0.03) and among stand-alone relative to integrated anatomy courses (P ≤ 0.03). Furthermore, computer-based assessment increased (P < 0.001) and assessment materials changed from cadaveric material to images (P < 0.03) during Covid-19, even though assessment structure was not different (P > 0.05). The use of digital teaching resources increased during Covid-19 (P < 0.001), with reports of increased use of in-house created content, BlueLink, and Complete Anatomy software (P < 0.05). While primarily representing US institutions, this study provided evidence of how anatomy educators adapted their courses, largely through virtual mediums, and modified laboratory protocols during the initial emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Advancements in human pluripotent stem cell technology offer a unique opportunity for the neuroimmunology field to study host-virus interactions directly in disease-relevant cells of the human central nervous system (CNS). Viral encephalitis is most commonly caused by herpesviruses, arboviruses and enteroviruses targeting distinct CNS cell types and often leading to severe neurological damage with poor clinical outcomes. Furthermore, different neurotropic viruses will affect the CNS at distinct developmental stages, from early prenatal brain development to the aged brain. With the unique flexibility and scalability of human pluripotent stem cell technology, it is now possible to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying acute infection and latency, determine which CNS subpopulations are specifically infected, study temporal aspects of viral susceptibility, perform high-throughput chemical or genetic screens for viral restriction factors and explore complex cell-non-autonomous disease mechanisms. Therefore, human pluripotent stem cell technology has the potential to address key unanswered questions about antiviral immunity in the CNS, including emerging questions on the potential CNS tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

AB  - The new coronavirus (CoV), called novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), belongs to the Coronaviridae family which was originated from the sea market in Wuhan city in China, at the end of the year 2019. COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are belonging to the same family (Coronaviridae). The current outbreak of COVID-19 creates public concern and threats all over the world and now it spreads out to more than 250 countries and territories. The researchers and scientists from all over the world are trying to find out the therapeutic strategies to abate the morbidity and mortality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic. The replication, spreading, and severity of SARS-CoV2 depend on environmental settings. Noteworthy, meteorological parameters are considered as crucial factors that affect respiratory infectious disorders, although the controversial effect of the meteorological parameter is exposed against COVID-19. Besides, COVID-19 accelerates the pathogenesis of the neurological disorders. However, the pathogenic mechanisms between COVID-19 and neurological disorders are still unclear. Hence, this review is focused on the genomics and ecology of SARS-CoV2 and elucidated the effects of climatic factors on the progression of COVID-19. This review also critically finds out the vulnerability between COVID-19 and neurological disorders based on the latest research data.

AB  - The response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the research and science community has been vigorous, with information being released faster than that of any other event in human history. Articles related to the virus were being rapidly published by January 2020. A small fraction of these publications comprised reports of prospective clinical trials (0.25%), and many of these trials have imparted conflicting conclusions, leading to confusion among the public and the scientific community. Additionally, the pandemic has raised many serious scientific and ethical concerns related to clinical research. In this review, we divided the conduct of clinical research trials into three steps and critically reviewed each step, along with the challenges and obstacles arising amid the ongoing crisis. The clinical research steps we reviewed include (1) clinical trial design factors such as social and scientific value, feasibility, single vs. multicenter trials, randomization, control groups, endpoints, off-label and compassionate use of medications, data analysis, and verifying the integrity of data; (2) ethical issues such as committee approvals, efficiency, virtual visits and remote monitoring, informed consent, shipping investigational products, and external monitoring and audits; and (3) publication and sharing of preprints, press releases, social media, and misinformation. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting existing clinical trials for other ailments and diseases, including cancer, with most trials being delayed or deferred. Although urgency is needed to communicate effective treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19, research efforts should maintain the same high-quality core ethical principles that governed human subject research before the pandemic. Despite the catastrophic devastation caused by the pandemic, the adoption of more flexible, cost-effective methods of conducting clinical trials (without compromising ethical conduct, safety, or data integrity, while maintaining research efficiency) represents a potential silver lining. Streamlining clinical research will help to congruently address other important health issues, despite the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether a specific chest CT characteristic is associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. This meta-analysis was performed to assess the relationship between different chest CT features and severity of clinical presentation in COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, web of science databases (WOS), Cochrane library, and Google scholar were searched up to May 19, 2020 for observational studies that assessed the relationship of different chest CT manifestations and the severity of clinical presentation in COVID-19 infection. Risk of bias assessment was evaluated applying the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects model or fixed-effects model, as appropriately, were used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using Forest plot, Cochran's Q test, and I2. Publication bias was assessed applying Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies involving 3323 patients were included. Bronchial wall thickening (OR 11.64, 95% CI 1.81-74.66) was more likely to be associated with severe cases of COVID-19 infection, followed by crazy paving (OR 7.60, 95% CI 3.82-15.14), linear opacity (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.10-9.70), and GGO (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08-1.73). However, there was no significant association between the presence of consolidation and severity of clinical presentation (OR 2.33, 95% CI 0.85-6.36). Considering the lesion distribution bilateral lung involvement was more frequently associated with severe clinical presentation (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.74-6.79). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis of observational studies indicates some specific chest CT features are associated with clinical severity of COVID-19.

AB  - The Hajj pilgrimage, one of the five pillars of Islam, is held in Saudi Arabia in the second week of Dhu'l-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. It is one of the world's largest mass gatherings, constituting more than 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims from more than 180 countries. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant public health threat for such mass gatherings. Thus, a health risk assessment for the 2020 Hajj was held by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine, which concluded that foreign pilgrims should be excluded from the 2020 Hajj and that the number of pilgrims should be significantly reduced. Timely decisions allowed the Saudi government to conduct the Hajj, despite an initial postponement. However, the number of pilgrims was significantly downscaled, and extensive new protocols were set in place because of the pandemic. This article aims to shed light on the challenges faced and efforts made by Saudi Arabia to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 during the religious proceedings of the Hajj.

AB  - Outbreaks of the novel coronavirus disease (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: SARS-CoV-2) (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) remind us once again of the mechanisms of zoonotic outbreaks. Climate change and the expansion of agricultural lands and infrastructures due to population growth will ultimately reduce or eliminate wildlife and avian habitats and increase opportunities for wildlife and birds to come into contact with livestock and humans. Consequently, infectious pathogens are transmitted from wildlife and birds to livestock and humans, promoting zoonotic diseases. In addition, the spread of diseases has been associated with air pollution and social inequities, such as racial discrimination, gender inequality, and racial, economic, and educational disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic is a fresh reminder of the significance of excessive greenhouse gas excretion and air pollution, highlighting social inequities and distortions. This provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of our trajectory. Therefore, this review glances through the COVID-19 pandemic and discusses our future.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The escalating number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals has conferred the viral spread with the status of global pandemic. However, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic drugs available on the market to treat COVID-19, although several drugs have been approved. Recently, two articles using the comparative viral-human protein-protein interaction map revealed that the sigma-1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Knockout and knockdown of SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor, encoded by SIGMAR1) caused robust reductions in SARS-CoV-2 replication, which indicates that the sigma-1 receptor is a key therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor, could prevent clinical deterioration in adult outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the brief history of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Here, we propose repurposing of traditional central nervous system (CNS) drugs that have a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor (i.e., fluvoxamine, donepezil, ifenprodil) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Finally, we discussed the potential of other CNS candidates such as cutamesine and arketamine.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), employs host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. Genetic analyses of ACE2 have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specific to different human populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have indicated that several of these SNPs could affect interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, thereby providing a partial explanation for the regional differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity. However, the significance of population-specific ACE2 SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is unknown, as no in vitro validation studies have been performed. Here, we analyzed the impact of eight SNPs found in specific populations on receptor binding and cell entry in vitro. Except for a SNP causing a nonsense mutation that reduced ACE2 expression, none of the selected SNPs markedly altered the interaction between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S), which is responsible for receptor recognition and cell entry, or the efficiency of viral cell entry mediated by SARS-2-S. Our findings indicate that ACE2 polymorphisms have limited impact on the ACE2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the importance of future studies on the involvement of population-specific SNPs of other host genes in susceptibility toward SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Like all infectious diseases, the infection rate of COVID-19 is dependent on many variables. In order to effectively prepare a localized plan for infectious disease management, it is important to find the relationship between COVID-19 infection rate and other key variables. This study aims to understand the spatial relationships between COVID-19 infection rate and key variables of air pollution, geo-meteorological, and social parameters in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The relationship was analyzed using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) by means of COVID-19 infection rate as a dependent variable and 17 independent variables. This study revealed that air pollution parameters like PM2.5 (p < 0.02), AOT (p < 0.01), CO (p < 0.05), water vapor (p < 0.01), and O3 (p < 0.01) were highly correlated with COVID-19 infection rate while geo-meteorological parameters like DEM (p < 0.01), wind pressure (p < 0.01), LST (p < 0.04), rainfall (p < 0.01), and wind speed (p < 0.03) were also similarly associated. Social parameters like population density (p < 0.01), brickfield density (p < 0.02), and poverty level (p < 0.01) showed high coefficients as the key independent variables to COVID-19 infection rate. Significant robust relationships between these factors were found in the middle and southern parts of the city where the reported COVID-19 infection case was also higher. Relevant agencies can utilize these findings to formulate new and smart strategies for reducing infectious diseases like COVID-19 in Dhaka and in similar urban cities around the world. Future studies will have more variables including ecological, meteorological, and economical to model and understand the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Objective: To investigate the clinical manifestations including signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Scholarly databases such as PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences, and Google scholar were searched on April 7, 2020. Meta-analysis was performed via comprehensive meta-analysis software using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each variable. Results: Ten studies were selected. The pooled prevalence for fever, post-partum fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea were 66.8%, 37.1%, 35%, 24.6 %, 14.9%, 14.6%, 11.5%, and 7.6%, respectively. Laboratory test results were 49.8% for lymphopenia, 47.7% for leukocytosis, 83.7% for elevated neutrophil ratio, 57% for elevated C-reactive protein, and 71.4% for decreased lymphocyte ratio. The rate of cesarean section for delivery in all cases was 84%. Of the newborns of the corona-positive mothers, only one had a positive test result. Also, there was only one death due to a decreased lymphocyte ratio. Conclusion: Fever was the most common sign and symptom in pregnant women with COVID-19. Among the laboratory tests, the highest amount was related to elevated neutrophil ratio. It seems that due to the differences between pregnant women and the general population, special measures should be considered to treat these patients.

AB  - Background: The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library serves a community of over 22,000 individuals primarily from the Yale Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing and the Yale New Haven Hospital. Though they are geographically close to one another, reaching these disparate populations can be a challenge. Having a clear and thorough communication plan has proved invaluable in transcending communication chasms, especially in recent times of crisis. Case Presentation: This article describes the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library's methods for communicating and promoting its remote resources and services in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It details our communication strategies and messages leading up to, and after, the Yale campus was closed and specifies how we pivoted from reaching users inside the library to reaching our audiences remotely. Conclusions: Our communication plan has provided the foundation for all of our messaging, be it print or digital media. In recent moments of crisis, it has been especially helpful for planning and executing large scale messaging. Similarly, knowing whom to contact around our organization to promote our message in different and broader ways has been extremely beneficial.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare providers across all specialties to adjust their methods of clinical practice. In Dermatology, focus on the continued safe usage of immunomodulating biologic therapies has attracted particular interest as the COVID-19 virus represents a novel infection risk. While guidance on biologic initiation and continuation has been established,1 the return to normalcy will likely involve a safe and effective vaccine. This vaccine(s) will represent a new clinical hurdle for prescribers who have continued patients on biologic therapy throughout the pandemic.

AB  - Crisis events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can have a devastating effect on communities and the care professionals within them. Over recent years, arts-based interventions have helped in a wide range of crisis situations, being recommended to support the workforce during and after complex crisis but there has been no systematic review of the role of arts-based crisis interventions and whether there are cogent themes regarding practice elements and outcomes. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review to (i) define the arts-based change process used during and after crisis events, and (ii) explore the perceptions of intermediate and long-term mental health benefits of arts-based interventions for professionals in caring roles. Our search yielded six studies (all qualitative). All data were thematically aggregated and meta-synthesized, revealing seven practice elements (a safe place, focusing on strengths and protective factors, developing psychosocial competencies to support peers, emotional expression and processing, identifying and naming the impact of the crisis, using an integrative creative approach, and cultural and organizational sensitivity) applied across all six studies, as well as a range of intermediate and long-term benefits shared common features (adapting, growing, and recovering; using the community as a healing resource; reducing or preventing symptoms of stress or trauma reactions, psychophysiological homeostasis). The ways in which these studies were designed independently from one another and yet used the same practice elements in their crisis interventions indicates that there is comparability about how and why the arts-based practice elements are being used and to what effect. Our findings provide a sound basis and meaningful parameters for future research incorporating quantitative and qualitative approaches to firmly establish the effectiveness of art-based interventions, and how arts can support cultural sensitivity, acceptability and indicated outcomes, particularly those relating to stress and trauma during or following a crisis.

AB  - Background COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of delirium and delirium-related symptoms in COVID-19 patients, data and evidence-based recommendations on the pathophysiology and management of delirium are limited. Objective We conducted a rapid review of COVID-19-related delirium literature to provide a synthesis of literature on the prevalence, pathoetiology, and management of delirium in these patients. Methods Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, LitCovid, WHO-COVID-19, and Web of Science electronic databases were conducted. Grey literature was also reviewed, including preprint servers, archives, and websites of relevant organizations. Search results were limited to the English language. We included literature focused on adults with COVID-19 and delirium. Papers were excluded if they did not mention signs or symptoms of delirium. Results 229 studies described prevalence, pathoetiology, and/or management of delirium in adults with COVID-19. Delirium was rarely assessed with validated tools. Delirium affected >50% of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The etiology of COVID-19 delirium is likely multifactorial, with some evidence of direct brain effect. Prevention remains the cornerstone of management in these patients. To date, there is no evidence to suggest specific pharmacological strategies. Discussion Delirium is common in COVID-19 and may manifest from both indirect and direct effects on the central nervous system. Further research is required to investigate contributing mechanisms. As there is limited empirical literature on delirium management in COVID-19, management with non-pharmacological measures and judicious use of pharmacotherapy is suggested.

AB  - Background Immunochromatographic rapid antigen tests (RATs) emerged onto the COVID-19 pandemic testing landscape to aid in the rapid diagnosis of people with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. RATs are particularly useful where RT-PCR is not immediately available and symptoms suggestive of a high viral load and infectiousness are assumed. Several lateral flow immunoassays have been authorized for use under EUA and/or the CE mark, presenting varying overall clinical performance data generated by the manufacturer or by independent investigators. To compare the real-world clinical performance of commercially available rapid chromatographic immunoassays intended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a systematic meta-analysis of published data.Methods We searched the MEDLINE®, Embase, BIOSIS and Derwent Drug File (ProQuest)for manufacturer-independent prospective clinical performance studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RATs and RT-PCR assays. Only studies on lateral flow assays not needing a separate reader for retrieving the result were included, if data were available on viral load, patients’ symptom status, sample type, and PCR assay used. For better data comparability, recalculation of the studies’ single performance data confidence intervals using the exact Clopper–Pearson method was applied.Results We could include 19 studies (ten peer-reviewed) presenting detailed clinical performance data on 11,209 samples with 2449 RT-PCR-positives out of study prevalence rates between 1.9–100 % and between 50– 100% symptomatic samples. Four studies directly compared two to three different RATs and 15 studies compared one RAT to RT-PCR. Overall specificity ranged, with one test outlier, between 92.4% (87.4– 95.9) and 100% (99.7–100), and overall clinical sensitivity varied between 28.9% (16.4–44.3) and 98.3% (91.1–99.7), depending on assay, population characteristics, viral load, and symptom status. Sensitivity in high-viral-load samples (cycle threshold ≤25) showed a considerable heterogeneity among the assays ranging from 66.7% to 100%.Conclusion Only two RATs offered sufficient manufacturer-independent, real-world performance data supporting use for the detection of current SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic or high-viral-load patient populations. Reliable positive predictive values require testing of symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals only in case of a high pre-test probability. If RATs are used for screening of asymptomatic cases in low-prevalence scenarios, a lower positive predictive value of the result has to be considered.Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare support from Roche Diagnostics for the submitted work.

AB  - Introduction: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many family medicine clerkships across the United States are scrambling to provide meaningful medical education in a new clinical environment. Most medical schools have paused or severely limited the direct patient care that has been the core educational requirement of the clinical clerkships. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a curricular model that meets the family medicine clerkship learning objectives via telemedicine clinical instruction. Methods: We created a clerkship where all clinical encounters took place by phone or video visits. Students were required to have telemedicine encounters with at least 20 patients over a 4-week clerkship. We also created a telemedicine illness script-writing assignment to prepare students and faculty for these encounters. We evaluated our curriculum by surveying participating students and faculty members. Results: Student surveys revealed that all learning objectives were met during the telemedicine clerkship experience. Students felt they made a difference during the COVID-19 pandemic. Faculty felt that the medical students were helpful and that they were able to provide meaningful clinical instruction. Conclusion: Our study reveals that a family medicine clerkship can be successfully delivered using telemedicine and remote learning techniques. Senior medical students are a valuable resource and can have a meaningful clinical impact while learning more about family medicine. If social distancing precautions continue, this model can be used by other clerkships to continue medical education and provide medical care.

AB  - P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that binds to P-, E-, and L-selectins to mediate the tethering and rolling of immune cells on the surface of the endothelium for cell migration into inflamed tissues. PSGL-1 has been identified as an interferon-γ (INF-γ)-regulated factor that restricts HIV-1 infectivity, and has recently been found to possess broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we report that the expression of PSGL-1 in virus-producing cells impairs the incorporation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoproteins into pseudovirions and blocks pseudovirus attachment and infection of target cells. These findings suggest that PSGL-1 may potentially inhibit coronavirus replication in PSGL-1+ cells.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein has been proposed as a good vaccine target. N-specific T cells were observed in SARS-CoV-2 N immunized mice and COVID-19 convalescents. It is of importance to identify the T cell responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Intradermal immunization with SARS-CoV N protein was demonstrated to elicit non-protective T cell responses which may be avoided by intranasal vaccination. Therefore, we conducted intranasal vaccination of BALB/c mice with recombinant adenovirus type-5 expressing SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Such procedure induced CD8 T cell responses in the lung. Meanwhile CD4 T cell responses were observed in the spleen, which was associated with robust antibody production. Our study further supports the notion that SARS-CoV-2 N protein can work as a target for vaccine development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the context of COVID-19 outbreak, 80% of the persons are those with mild symptoms who are required to self-recover at home. They have a strong demand for remote healthcare that despite the great potential of artificial intelligence are not met in the current (e)-health services. Understanding the real needs of these persons is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to contribute with a fine grained understanding of the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms, in order to enhance AI in eHealth services. METHODS: Design research in which a qualitative approach was used to map the patient journey. Data on the home isolation experiences of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms was collected from top viewed personal video stories on YouTube and their additional comment threads. For the analysis this data was transcribed, coded and mapped into the patient journey map. RESULTS: The key findings on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms concern: (a) Considerable awareness period before testing positive and home-recovery period; (b) Less generic but more personal symptoms experiences; (c) Negative mood experience curve; (d) Inadequate home healthcare service support for mild COVID-19 patients through all stages. (e) Benefits and drawbacks of Social media support for mild COVID-19 patients; (f) Several touchpoint needs for home healthcare interaction with AI. CONCLUSIONS: The design of the patient journey map and underlying insights on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms serves Health - and IT professionals to more effectively apply AI technology into eHealth services for mild Covid-19 patients, for which three main service concepts are proposed: (I) Trustful public health information to release stress; (II) Personal Covid-19 health monitoring. (III) Community Support.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns, improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources. Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for this study. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals in medical informatics and expert round-table events, lay member meetings and the ePrescribing Toolkit (http://www.eprescribingtoolkit.com/)-an online resource supporting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through the ePrescribing process.

AB  - When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global health emergency, Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) debated the role of medical students during this developing pandemic. Initially, the discussion included whether medical students were essential personnel contributing to meaningful patient care. Many questions arose regarding how COVID-19 would affect medical education and if the changes would be temporary or continue for a significant period of time. Due to the lack of availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a decreased focus on clinical education within many healthcare settings, in March the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) declared that medical students were not essential personnel and recommended that COMs take a 'pause' and remove students from the clinical environment. This 'pause' would allow COMs time to assess where medical education could continue, to define the critical pieces of clinical education that required a clinical environment and to address how medical students could contribute during the pandemic. The AACOM Clinical Educators group began to meet on a weekly basis during this time so that Clinical Deans from Osteopathic medical schools across the country could collaborate, share ideas, discuss current challenges, and co-create a system to deliver medical education realizing the limitations of in-person clinical training.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global concern and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has quickly and effectively responded to the outbreak of COVID-19, using an internationally and nationally coordinated, to contain the spread of the virus within the borders. The PA approaches are containment and suppression, which is designed to protect the citizens from infection while also mitigating the stress on the health care system. The PA immediately declared a State of Emergency when the first cases in Palestine were diagnosed on 5 March 2020 and launched robust national containment measures to encourage the citizens to protect themselves and follow the guidance. Objectives: There is currently no vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, the treatment is either supportive and/ or the treatment of symptoms. Several strategies in the treatment of the disease were applied including medications. This review aims to summarize the different strategies, guidelines, challenges, and treatments used against COVID-19 worldwide and in Palestine. Materials and Methods: Different literature and guidelines among different databases were searched. Literature reviewing was conducted using the following search engines, Google Scholar, Medline, Pub Med, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Data also obtained from WHO and PA reports, and the published peer-reviewed articles of 2019-nCoV. The review focuses on the strategies, guidelines, therapeutics, challenges, and different approaches used in the treatment and management of the disease in Palestine and globally. Conclusion: The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH) strategies to end the COVID-19 pandemic were; slow and stop transmission; provide optimized care for patients; and minimize the impact of the epidemic on health systems, social services, and economic activity. Thus, proper management, right actions, and effective treatment of the disease should be considered to achieve these strategies. The biggest problem for PA to control and stop the outbreak of the disease is the different challenges which include; the Israeli military and economic control, uncontrol the borders, shortage of medical and financial resources, crowded cities and refugee camps, poverty, food insecurity, and the financial crisis. To date, there are no specific vaccines or medicines for COVID-19; and treatments are under investigation through clinical trials. However, an array of drugs approved for other indications, as well as multiple investigational agents, are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19; in several hundred clinical trials around the World. Treatment is essentially supportive and symptomatic.

AB  - The integration of technology in clinical care is growing rapidly and has become especially relevant during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Smartphone-based digital phenotyping, or the use of integrated sensors to identify patterns in behavior and symptomatology, has shown potential in detecting subtle moment-to-moment changes. These changes, often referred to as anomalies, represent significant deviations from an individual's baseline, may be useful in informing the risk of relapse in serious mental illness. Our investigation of smartphone-based anomaly detection resulted in 89% sensitivity and 75% specificity for predicting relapse in schizophrenia. These results demonstrate the potential of longitudinal collection of real-time behavior and symptomatology via smartphones and the clinical utility of individualized analysis. Future studies are necessary to explore how specificity can be improved, just-in-time adaptive interventions utilized, and clinical integration achieved.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, emergency department (ED) personnel will face a higher caseload, including those with special medical needs such as persons living with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D). Individuals with SCI/D who develop COVID-19 are at higher risk for rapid decompensation and development of acute respiratory failure during respiratory infections due to the combination of chronic respiratory muscle paralysis and autonomic dysregulation causing neurogenic restrictive/obstructive lung disease and chronic immune dysfunction. Often, acute respiratory infections will lead to significant mucus production in individuals with SCI/D, and aggressive secretion management is an important component of successful medical treatment. Secretion management techniques include nebulized bronchodilators, chest percussion/drainage techniques, manually assisted coughing techniques, nasotracheal suctioning, and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation. ED professionals, including respiratory therapists, should be familiar with the significant comorbidities associated with SCI/D and the customized secretion management procedures and techniques required for optimal medical management and prevention of respiratory failure. Importantly, protocols should also be implemented to minimize potential COVID-19 spread during aerosol-generating procedures.

AB  - Bioaerosols, including infectious diseases such as COVID-19, are a continuous threat to global public safety. Despite their importance, the development of a practical, real-time means of monitoring bioaerosols has remained elusive. Here, we present a novel, simple, and highly efficient means of obtaining enriched bioaerosol samples. Aerosols are collected into a thin and stable liquid film by the unique interaction of a superhydrophilic surface and a continuous two-phase centrifugal flow. We demonstrate that this method can provide a concentration enhancement ratio of ∼2.4 × 106 with a collection efficiency of ∼99.9% and an aerosol-into-liquid transfer rate of ∼95.9% at 500 nm particle size (smaller than a single bacterium). This transfer is effective in both laboratory and external ambient environments. The system has a low limit of detection of <50 CFU/m3air using a straightforward bioluminescence-based technique and shows significant potential for air monitoring in occupational and public-health applications.

Currently Kr-Cl lamps are the only viable "far-UV-C" sources for full-room inactivation of airborne SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic1 . Commercially available Kr-Cl excimer lamps can be retro-fitted to existing room lamp fittings or mounted at ceiling height independently. Other technologies, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), are currently neither efficient nor powerful enough for such a task.

AB  - The ability for viruses to mutate and evade the human immune system and cause infection, called viral escape, remains an obstacle to antiviral and vaccine development. Understanding the complex rules that govern escape could inform therapeutic design. We modeled viral escape with machine learning algorithms originally developed for human natural language. We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence's grammaticality but change its meaning. With this approach, language models of influenza hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike viral proteins can accurately predict structural escape patterns using sequence data alone. Our study represents a promising conceptual bridge between natural language and viral evolution.

AB  - COVID-19 vaccination efforts are underway offering hope for saving lives and eliminating the pandemic. The most promising vaccines require two injections separated 3-4 weeks apart. To achieve heard immunity, 60-80% of the population or perhaps more must be inoculated. Anticipation of adherence challenges has generated commentaries on strategies to enhance adherence including financial incentives. A notable gap in these commentaries is any discussion of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of financial incentives for increasing vaccine adherence. This commentary addresses that gap. There is a body of controlled trials on incentivizing vaccine adherence, mostly to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine among injection drug users (IDUs). Prevalence of HBV infection is increasing as part of the opioid addiction crisis. The HBV vaccine entails a three-dose regimen (typically 0, 1, and 6 months) which has created adherence challenges among IDUs. Systematic literature reviews document significant benefit of financial incentives. For example, a 2019 meta-analysis (Tressler & Bhandari, 2019) examined 11 controlled trials examining HBV-vaccine adherence strategies, including financial incentives, accelerated dosing schedules, and case-management/enhanced services. Financial incentives were most effective resulting in a 7-fold increase in adherence to the vaccination regimen relative to no financial incentives (OR, 7.01; 95% CI, 2.88-17.06). Additional reviews provide further support for the efficacy of financial incentives for promoting adherence with vaccination (HBV & influenza). Overall, this literature suggests that financial incentives could be helpful in promoting the high levels of adherence to COVID-19 vaccines that experts project will be necessary for herd immunity.

AB  - Treatment for critical illness typically focuses on a patient's short-term physical recovery; however, recent work has broadened our understanding of the long-term implications of illness and treatment strategies. In particular, survivors of critical illness have significantly elevated risk of developing lasting cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we examine the role of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in neuropsychiatric outcomes following critical illness. Illness is marked by acute elevation of free cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) suppression, which typically normalize after recovery; however, prolonged dysregulation can sometimes occur. High glucocorticoid levels can cause lasting alterations to the plasticity and structural integrity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and this mechanism may plausibly contribute to impaired memory and cognition in critical illness survivors, though specific evidence is lacking. Glucocorticoids may also exacerbate inflammation-associated neural damage. Conversely, current evidence indicates that glucocorticoids during illness may protect against the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We propose future directions for research in this field, including determining the role of persistent glucocorticoid elevations after illness in neuropsychiatric outcomes, the role of systemic vs. neuroinflammation, and probing unexplored lines of investigation on the role of mineralocorticoid receptors and the gut-brain axis. Progress toward personalized medicine in this area has the potential to produce tangible improvements to the lives patients after a critical illness, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the worst global health crises of this generation. The core of this pandemic is the rapid transmissibility of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, its high morbidity and mortality, and the presence of infectious asymptomatic carriers. As a result, COVID-19 has dominated this year's headlines and commanded significant research attention. As we consider SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that scientists, governments, the media, and the general population also come to grips with the everyday cost of parasitic diseases. Plasmodium (malaria), schistosomes, filarial worms, hookworms, Ascaris, whipworms, and other protozoan and metazoan parasites take a tremendous toll on local communities. Yet, because most of these diseases are no longer endemic to developed countries, their research and intervention are not funded at levels that are proportional to their global morbidity and mortality. The scientific and public health communities must indeed vigorously fight SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, but while doing so and beyond, it will be essential to demonstrate steadfast resolve toward understanding and combating the parasitic diseases that for centuries have haunted humankind.

AB  - Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease- as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.

AB  - Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread worldwide rapidly and patients with cancer have been considered as a vulnerable group for this infection. This study aimed to examine the expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in tumor tissues of six common cancer types. Materials and Methods: The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tumors and control samples were obtained from online databases. Survival prognosis and biological functions of these genes were investigated for each tumor type. Results: There was the overexpression of ACE2 in colon and stomach adenocarcinomas compared to controls, meanwhile colon and prostate adenocarcinomas showed a significantly higher expression of TMPRSS2. Additionally, survival prognosis analysis has demonstrated that upregulation of ACE2 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with higher overall survival (hazard ratio=0.65, p=0.016) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio=0.66, p=0.007), while overexpression of TMPRSS2 was associated with a 26% reduced risk of death in lung adenocarcinoma (p=0.047) but 50% increased risk of death in breast invasive carcinoma (p=0.015). Conclusion: There is a need to take extra precautions for COVID-19 in patients with colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer. Further information on other types of cancer at different stages should be investigated.

AB  - In response to climbing global case and fatality rates of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease, COVID-19, ophthalmology practices have modified their clinical and operative approach to patient care in an attempt to reduce spread of the virus. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the preocular tear film raises speculation that the ocular surface can act as an initial site of infection as well as a potential source of person-to-person viral transmission. More recently, conjunctival specimens and immunohistochemical analyses have identified the presence of cellular surface factors necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ocular surface. Together, these results highlight the importance of safety measures in ophthalmology practices to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As ophthalmic exams typically require close proximity between a patient's respiratory tract and the provider, clinical and surgical recommendations are aimed at reducing unnecessary patient-provider interactions. Subspecialty professional guidelines can be used to instruct ophthalmologists on the necessity of various procedures and best practice measures. Ophthalmology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic has been dramatically curtailed in an effort to reduce the risk of transmission and converse valuable personal protective equipment (PPE), and the impacts of the ongoing pandemic on ophthalmology practices will be felt for the foreseeable future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In intensive care units (ICUs) treating patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) invasive ventilation poses a high risk for aerosol and droplet formation. Surface contamination of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or bacteria can result in nosocomial transmission. METHODS: Two tertiary care COVID-19 intensive care units treating 53 patients for 870 patient days were sampled after terminal cleaning and preparation for regular use to treat non-COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 176 swabs were sampled of defined locations covering both ICUs. No SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected. Gram-negative bacterial contamination was mainly linked to sinks and siphons. Skin flora was isolated from most swabbed areas and Enterococcus faecium was detected on two keyboards. CONCLUSIONS: After basic cleaning with standard disinfection measures no remaining SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Bacterial contamination was low and mainly localised in sinks and siphons.

AB  - The infection due to the SARS-CoV-2 leads lesions mainly observed at the respiratory tract level, but not exclusively. The analyses of these lesions benefited from different autopsy studies. Thus, these lesions were observed in different organs, tissues and cells. These observations allowed us to rapidly improve the knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this emergent infectious disease. The virus can be detected in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, molecular biology and/or electron microscopy approaches. However, many uncertainties are still present concerning the direct role of the SARS-CoV-2 on the different lesions observed in different organs, outside the lung, such as the heart, the brain, the liver, the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney and the skin. In this context, it is pivotal to keep going to increase the different tissue and cellular studies in the COVID-19 positive patients aiming to better understanding the consequences of this new infectious disease, notably considering different epidemiological and co-morbidities associated factors. This could participate to the development of new therapeutic strategies too. The purpose of this review is to describe the main histological and cellular lesions associated with the infection due to the SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, this pandemic led to sudden impact in the management of tissue and cytological samples by pathology laboratories and biobanks. The consequences concerned the urgent mandatory setting up of sanitary measures adapted to these laboratories. Another consequence was to note a strong decrease of the different activities in pathology laboratories and biobanks. So, in this context, the health workers in pathology laboratories and biobanks had to organize their laboratories according to the international guidelines for sanitary measures, aiming to keep going to take care of clinical and molecular diagnoses too. This review adresses the main consequences induced by the Covid-19 pandemic in pathology laboratories and in biobanks and some of the different actions took by these laboratories in order to maintain their activity during this crisis period.

AB  - For the last decade, there has been growing concern regarding the rising rates of youth engagement in self-injury and suicide. The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has elevated these concerns due to increased risk factors pertaining to social, family, economic, and health stressors, in addition to changes to typical routines and support systems. Unfortunately, there are many barriers to at-risk youth being able to access evidence-based mental health services including cost, lack of trained providers, transportation issues, and physical distancing due to the pandemic. Providing school-based prevention and intervention programs that promote social, emotional, and behavioral well-being helps to address many of these barriers. This article highlights important considerations to providing these services in a school-based telehealth modality. Symptom clusters that put youth at risk of harm to self are described. Best practice therapeutic modalities that can be disseminated in a school-based telehealth modality, such as cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based approaches, are reviewed. Although there is growing empirical literature for these school-based prevention and intervention approaches, additional research is needed to determine how to best support at-risk youth remotely.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Some COVID-19 patients may present with cutaneous changes related to new rashes, the virus itself, or drug treatments. The diagnosis of these cutaneous changes may be challenging and resemble other cutaneous conditions. Nurses should have adequate knowledge and skills to assess these cutaneous changes to provide safe care. This article highlights an overview of cutaneous changes in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Despite being the wealthiest and one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, the United States has the greatest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. What accounts for this failure? The dismantling of the country's public health infrastructure has crippled contact tracing and exacerbated inequality as a disproportionate number of poor people and people of color have fallen ill with Covid-19. Inadequate regulation of the private for-profit sector has adversely affected the efficiency and quality of testing for the virus, and the prescription of costly drugs whose benefit and safety in treating infected patients have not been established. More stringent regulation of the commercial sector has led to the development of efficacious vaccines in a remarkably short time. Still, questions remain about the vaccines' effectiveness in the real world, and their safety.

AB  - Phylogenetic analysis is used to analyze the evolution of species according to the characteristics of biological sequences. The analytical results are generally represented by phylogenetic trees. NJ (neighbor joining) is a frequently used algorithm for constructing phylogenetic trees because of its few assumptions, fast operation, and high accuracy, and is based on the distance between taxa. It is known that NJ usually constructs different phylogenetic trees for the same dataset with differences in input order, which are known as "tied trees." This article proposes an improved method of NJ, called ENJ (extended neighbor joining). The ENJ can join several (currently limited to three) nodes with the same minimum distance into a new node, rather than joining two nodes in one iteration, so it can construct triple phylogenetic trees. We have inferred the formulas for updating the distance values and calculating the branch lengths for the ENJ algorithm. We have tested the ENJ with simulated and real data. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, the trees constructed by the ENJ have greater similarity to the initial trees, and the ENJ is much faster than the NJ algorithm. Moreover, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related coronaviruses by ENJ, which shows that COVID-19 and SARS-CoV are closer than other coronaviruses. Because it differs from the existing phylogenetic trees for those coronaviruses, we constructed a phylogenetic network for them. The network shows those species have had a reticulate evolution.

AB  - Our aim was to assess the association between obesity and the risk of unfavourable outcomes (composite of severe disease and mortality) in inpatients with COVID-19. We conducted a systematic search of databases between December 2019 and 28th June 2020. Studies were included if they reported or allowed estimation of an odds ratio (OR) for unfavourable outcome in obese compared to non-obese patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Twenty cohort studies of 28 355 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 infection were included. Meta-analysis estimated a pooled OR of 2.02 (1.41-2.89, p<0.001) for an unfavourable outcome in obese versus non-obese patients when adjusted for age, sex and co-morbidities. When unadjusted for confounders, the OR for unfavourable outcomes was 1.25 (CI 1.07-1.45, p=0.005). An increased adjusted OR was also seen for death (OR 1.51; CI 1.13-2.21, p=0.006) and severe illness (OR 2.26; CI 1.47-3.48, p<0.001). Compared to a normal BMI, the risk of an unfavourable outcome was increased even in overweight patients, with severe obesity having an escalated risk.Obesity is independently associated with an unfavourable outcome of COVID-19 illness, with obese patients having twice the risk of a composite outcome of severe disease or mortality, and a 50% increased risk of death.

AB  - Healthcare workers are at elevated risk to develop symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in response to an outbreak of a highly infectious disease. The current study set-out to model the complex interrelations between PTSD symptoms during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in 291 Chinese healthcare workers and 291 matched control cases that were selected from the general population. For this purpose, we estimated regularized partial correlation networks. Within the network of healthcare workers, we observed a central role for avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, physiological cue reactivity, anger/irritability, re-experiencing, and startle. We identified three clusters of closely interconnected PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers, consisting of (a) symptoms of re-experiencing and anxious arousal, (b) symptoms of avoidance and amnesia, and (c) symptoms of emotional numbing and dysphoric arousal. Respectively, startle, avoidance of reminders, and feeling detached emerged as bridging nodes in these communities. Although yielding highly similar network models, the PTSD symptom structure of healthcare workers showed several unique features compared to the matched control sample. This is informative for interventions aimed at targeting PTSD symptoms in healthcare workers in the context of a public health emergency. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused stress and anxiety in many people that can be reduced by regular physical activity. Regular physical exercise is essential for health. In the absence of COVID-19 symptoms, no limitation in physical activity is recommended. However, parameters such as frequency, intensity, type, and time need to be considered to prescribe the program and obtain the best results. Consequently, the level of physical activity that should be done during the outbreak has always been one of the most important and common questions.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus strain responsible for the current pandemic of COVID-19, has rendered the entire humanity suffering. Several months have passed since the pandemic has struck. However, the world is still looking for an effective treatment plan to battle the viral infection. The first vaccine just received emergency approval in December 2020 for use in USA and UK. These are excellent news, however, the worldwide distribution of such vaccine, the possibility of virus mutation and the lack of data regarding the long-term effects of such vaccines are a significant concern. In addition, although remdesivir was recently approved by the FDA to be used as a clinical drug against COVID-19, it hasn't stood out yet as a proven form of therapeutics. Such inability to produce a novel therapy has caused enough inconveniences for the affected people worldwide. Repurposing the already available drugs to fight against the virus seems to be a reasonable option amidst such uncertainty. Given the vast collection of potential treatment candidates to be explored against COVID-19, there is a decent chance that a success in this regard will serve the intermediary purpose of clinically treating the infection until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed worldwide and will be able to treat COVID-19 patients that do not adequately respond to vaccines. Such treatments may prove very useful in future coronavirus outbreaks too. Proper research into these repurposing treatments may yield a certain insight into the field of novel treatment production as well. This review study accumulates a relevant set of information about drugs and vaccines against COVID-19, in terms of their repurposing properties and the specific phases of clinical trials they are undergoing across the world. A potential timeline is also suggested to estimate when an effective result can be expected from the ongoing clinical trials for a better anticipation of the drug landscape. This study will hopefully help accelerate investment of resources into development and discovery of drugs and vaccines against the infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The preliminary report of the RECOVERY large randomised controlled trial indicated a promising survival effect for dexamethasone therapy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the anti-hypoxic activities of dexamethasone to understand a possible mechanism of its action in hypoxia-induced lethality through experimental models of hypoxia. METHODS: In this investigation, 84 Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into groups of seven (12 groups). Treatment groups received 10 days of dexamethasone intraperitoneal injection at both human dose (~0.1 mg/kg) and the animal does (~1 mg/kg). Control negative and positive groups were treated with 10 ml/kg of normal saline and 30 mg/kg of propranolol, respectively. Three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, circulatory, and hemic were applied in this study. RESULTS: The findings showed that dexamethasone significantly prolonged the latency for death in the asphyctic model concerning the control group in both humans (P < .0001) and animal dose (P < .0001). The results were also highly significant for both doses in the hemic model (P < .001). In the circulatory model, although a small increase was observed in death prolongation, results were not statistically significant for both doses in this model (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental in vivo investigation demonstrated an excellent protective effect for 10 days of dexamethasone treatment against hypoxia, especially in asphyctic and hemic models. In addition to promising dexamethasone outcomes, using propranolol as the positive control illustrated a very substantial anti-hypoxic effect even much better than dexamethasone in all models. It seems that propranolol would be a safe, potential, and prudent choice to invest in treating COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The science around the use of masks by the public to impede COVID-19 transmission is advancing rapidly. In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people ("source control") with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease of cats that can be very difficult to definitively diagnose antemortem. Multiplex fluorescent immunocytochemical (MF-ICC) assays are emerging as useful diagnostic tests in veterinary medicine, particularly for fluid samples. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and optimize an MF-ICC assay to detect feline coronavirus within macrophages, with the primary goal of determining the allowable/recommended sample storage conditions for clinical use of this assay. METHODS: A feline macrophage cell line was infected with the FIP virus. Following harvest into EDTA tubes (simulating typical clinical collection of effusion), cells were stored at 4℃, 22℃, and 37℃. For each temperature condition, slides for MF-ICC were made at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days post-collection. To assess the stability of immunoreactivity following fixation, freshly harvested infected cells were fixed onto slides and maintained at 4℃ for 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks. All slides were analyzed by MF-ICC for the presence of mononuclear cells with co-expression of vimentin and coronaviral antigen. RESULTS: MF-ICC confirmed that cells tested positive for coronavirus at 4℃ through 3 days post-harvest, 22℃ through 48 hours post-harvest, and 37℃ through 24 hours post-harvest. The MF-ICC assay was successfully performed on fixed slides through the 12-week time point. This assay also demonstrated positive results on a clinical sample of abdominal fluid from a cat later confirmed to have FIP. CONCLUSIONS: The MF-ICC assay described here offers a potentially specific and relatively stable antemortem diagnostic test for feline infectious peritonitis. Evaluation of this assay in clinical samples is ongoing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in comparison with the non-severe patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI to collect all relevant studies published before July 26, 2020, and a total of 30 papers were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the severe COVID-19 patients, 60% (95% CI = 56-64%) were male, 25% (95% CI = 21-29%) were over 65 years old, 34% (95% CI = 24-44%) were obese, and 55% (95% CI = 41-70%) had comorbidities. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (34%, 95% CI = 25-44%), diabetes (20%, 95% CI = 15-25%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD; 12%, 95% CI = 9-16%). The most common blood test abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 87%, 82-92%), decreased lymphocyte count (68%, 58-77%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (69%, 95% CI = 57-81%). In addition, abnormal laboratory findings revealing organ dysfunctions were frequently observed in the severe cases, including decrease in albumin (43%, 95% CI = 24-63%) and increase in aspartate aminotransferase (47%, 95% CI = 38-56%), alanine aminotransferase (28%, 95% CI = 16-39%), troponin I/troponin T (TnI/TnT; 29%, 95% CI = 13-45%), and serum Cr (SCr; 10%, 95% CI = 5-15%). CONCLUSION: The male, elderly and obese patients and those with any comorbidities, especially with hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, were more likely to develop into severe cases. But the association between hypertension, diabetes, CVD, and severity of COVID-19 was declined by the increase of age. A significant elevation in cardiac TnI/TnT, the hepatic enzymes, and SCr and the reduction in lymphocytes with elevated CRPs are important markers for the severity. Specific attention should be given to the elderly male and obese patients and those with indications of severe immune injury in combination with bacterial infection and indication of multi-organ dysfunction or damages.

AB  - In early January 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and readily available bioinformatics pipelines. In addition to virus discovery, these NGS technologies and bioinformatics resources are currently being employed for ongoing genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, tracking its spread, evolution and patterns of variation on a global scale. In this review, we summarize the bioinformatics resources used for the discovery and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these bioinformatics resources and highlight areas where additional technical developments are urgently needed. Solutions to these problems will be beneficial not only to the prevention and control of the current COVID-19 pandemic but also to infectious disease outbreaks of the future.

AB  - Objective: The sudden disruption of university teaching caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced universities to switch to online teaching. It is vital for graduating medical students to learn about COVID-19 because they are likely to treat COVID-19 patients after graduation. We developed a COVID-19 lesson for medical students that used either an online lecture or a serious game that we designed. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a serious game versus online lectures for improving medical students' COVID-19 knowledge. Materials and Methods: From our university's database of knowledge scores, we collected the prelesson, postlesson, and final test knowledge scores of the students who participated in the lesson and conducted a retrospective comparative analysis. Results: An analysis of scores concerning knowledge of COVID-19 from prelesson and postlesson tests shows that both teaching methods produce significant increases in short-term knowledge, with no statistical difference between the two methods (P > 0.05). The final test scores, however, show that the group of students who used the game-based computer application scored significantly higher in knowledge retention than did the online lecture group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: In the context of the disruption of traditional university teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the serious game we designed is potentially an effective option for online medical education about COVID-19, particularly in terms of its capacity for improved knowledge retention.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly throughout the whole world and caused significant difficulties in the prevention and control of the epidemic. In this case, several detection methods have been established based on nucleic acid diagnostic techniques and immunoassays to achieve sensitive and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, most methods are still largely dependent on professional instruments, highly trained operators, and centralized laboratories. These limitations gravely diminish their practicality and portability. Herein, a CRISPR Cas12a based assay was developed for portable, rapid and sensitive of SARS-CoV-2. In this assay, samples were quickly pretreated and amplified by reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) under mild conditions. Then, by combining the CRISPR Cas12a system and a glucose-producing reaction, the signal of the virus was converted to that of glucose, which can be quantitatively read by a personal glucose meter in a few seconds. Nucleocapsid protein gene was tested as a model target, and the sensitivity for quantitative detection was as low as 10 copies/μL, which basically meet the needs of clinical diagnosis. In addition, with the advantages of lower material cost, shorter detection time, and no requirement for professional instrument in comparison with qRT-PCR, this assay is expected to provide a powerful technical support for the early diagnosis and intervention during epidemic prevention and control.

AB  - A growing number of studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are becoming available, but a synthesis of available data focusing on the critically ill population has not been conducted. We performed a scoping review to synthesize clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, we identified high-quality clinical studies describing critically ill patients with a sample size of greater than 20 patients by performing daily searches of the World Health Organization and LitCovid databases on COVID-19. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts (2785 unique articles), full text (218 articles), and abstracted data (92 studies). The 92 studies included 61 from Asia, 16 from Europe, 10 from North and South America, and 5 multinational studies. Notable similarities among critically ill populations across all regions included a higher proportion of older males infected and with severe illness, high frequency of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), abnormal chest imaging findings, and death secondary to respiratory failure. Differences in regions included newly identified complications (eg, pulmonary embolism) and epidemiological risk factors (eg, obesity), less chest computed tomography performed, and increased use of invasive mechanical ventilation (70% to 100% vs 15% to 47% of intensive care unit patients) in Europe and the United States compared with Asia. Future research directions should include proof-of-mechanism studies to better understand organ injuries and large-scale collaborative clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antivirals, antibiotics, interleukin 6 receptor blockers, and interferon. The current established predictive models require further verification in other regions outside China.

AB  - The World Health Organization emphasized the importance of goggles and face shields for protection of medical personnel at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unsurprisingly, almost all countries suffered from a critical supply shortage of goggles and face shields, as well as many other types of personal protective equipment (PPE), for a long period, owing to the lack of key medical material supplies and the inefficiency of existing fabrication methods arising from the need to avoid crowds during the outbreak of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel combined shield design for eye and face protection that can be rapidly fabricated using three-dimensional printing technology. The designed prototype eye-face shield is accessible to the general public, offering more possibilities for yield improvement in PPE during emergent infectious disease events such as COVID-19.

AB  - In a previous work [Huber et al. A minimal model for household effects in epidemics. Physical Biology, 17(6):065010], we discussed virus transmission dynamics modified by a uniform clustering of contacts in the population: close contacts within households and more distant contacts between households. In this paper, we discuss testing and tracing in such a stratified population. We propose a minimal tracing strategy consisting of random testing of the entire population plus full testing of the households of those persons found positive. We provide estimates of testing frequency for this strategy to work.

AB  - We know that youth who live in low-income households tend to have lower nutritional health outcomes-including higher rates of obesity-when compared to their higher-income counterparts. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest U.S. federal nutrition program and has been found to improve food security and to serve as an income support. It is less clear how SNAP may affect obesity in low-income youth. From a policy perspective, it is essential to understand how the largest federal nutrition assistance program influences the health of children and adolescents. We use the exogenous increase in SNAP benefits that was a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to identify how a change in benefits is linked with obesity in youth. We find evidence that the ARRA increase in SNAP benefits is associated with healthier weight outcomes in three of the four age groups examined. SNAP-eligible toddlers are less likely to be overweight and adolescents are less likely to be obese. These findings can help policy makers understand how additional SNAP benefits from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act may influence weight outcomes in children and adolescents.

AB  - The new outbreak caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 started at the end of 2019 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus. The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance. In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR. The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also help to detect previously infected asymptomatic individuals with negative RT-qPCR tests. Nevertheless, more controlled serology cohort studies should be performed as soon as possible to understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Although the range of immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is variable, cytokine storm is observed in a subset of symptomatic individuals. To further understand the disease pathogenesis and, consequently, to develop an additional tool for clinicians to evaluate patients for presumptive intervention we sought to compare plasma cytokine levels between a range of donor and patient samples grouped by a COVID-19 Severity Score (CSS) based on need for hospitalization and oxygen requirement. Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA). Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are few studies that compare the cadaver dissections with the medical simulators in means of talent improvement. Therefore, the aim of this study is to find out if using cadaver dissections is still the golden standard for surgical training or using the medical simulators in surgery could replace cadaver dissections. Material / Methods: The study is conducted during the European Orthopaedics & Traumatology Education Platform accredited Shoulder Club International Cadaver Course including a number of 34 orthopedics trainees. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to be trained with the simulator (Group 1) and on cadavers (Group 2), followed by a test performed on shoulder arthroscopy simulator (Virtamed ArthroSTM, Switzerland). There was no conflict of interest before, during, or after the study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. RESULTS: Group 2 had statistically significant higher Simulation Overview Procedure Time values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 3), the meaning of which is: Participants trained with the simulator completed the given tasks in a shorter period of time. Group 2 had statistically significant higher Scratching of Humerus Cartilage values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 4), which means: Participants trained with simulation has less scratching done on the humerus cartilage than the participants trained on a cadaver. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to compare VR Simulators with cadavers for surgical education in an objective manner, while using qualitative and quantitative data. According to this study, it is possible to state that VR Simulators are just as effective as cadavers in means of training subjects. As medical education will face a total change all around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has the potential to be an important guide during and after this period.

AB  - Severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the positive-sense RNA virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form RNA structures, yet as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome at single-nucleotide resolution in infected cells. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis shows that several features of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic structure are conserved across β-coronaviruses, and we pinpoint regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on the viral life cycle, facilitate primer design, and guide the identification of RNA drug targets against COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are the most prevalent mental health concern among older adults (possibly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic), which raises questions about how such symptoms can be lowered in this population. Existing research shows that offline social connectedness is a protective factor against depression in older adults; however, it is unknown whether web-based social connectedness can have similar effects. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether social connectedness on a support website protects older adults against depressive symptoms over the course of a year, above and beyond the protective effect of offline social connectedness. The secondary aim is to determine whether older adults with increased depressive symptoms are more likely to engage in social connectedness on this website. Thus, we examine depressive symptoms as both an outcome and predictor of web-based social connectedness to fully understand the chain of causality among these variables. Finally, we compare web-based social connectedness with offline social connectedness in their ability to lower depressive symptoms among older adults. METHODS: A total of 197 adults aged 65 years or older were given access to a social support website, where they were able to communicate with each other via a discussion forum for a year. Participants' social connectedness on the web-based platform, conceptualized as message production and consumption, was measured using behavioral log data as the number of messages participants wrote and read, respectively, during the first 6 months (t1) and the following 6 months (t2) of the study. Participants self-reported their offline social connectedness as the number of people in their support networks, and they reported their depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 both at baseline (t1) and at 12-month follow-up (t2). To ascertain the flow of causality between these variables, we employed a cross-lagged panel design, in which all variables were measured at t1 and t2. RESULTS: After controlling for the effect of offline support networks at t1, web-based message consumption at t1 decreased older adults' depressive symptoms at t2 (β=-.11; P=.02), but web-based message production at t1 did not impact t2 depressive symptoms (β=.12; P=.34). Web-based message consumption had a larger effect (β=-.11; P=.02) than offline support networks (β=-.08; P=.03) in reducing older adults' depressive symptoms over time. Higher baseline depressive symptoms did not predict increased web-based message consumption (β=.12; P=.36) or production (β=.02; P=.43) over time. CONCLUSIONS: The more messages older adults read on the web-based forum for the first 6 months of the study, the less depressed they felt at the 1-year follow-up, above and beyond the availability of offline support networks at baseline. This pinpoints the substantial potential of web-based communication to combat depressive symptoms in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA) are important risk factors of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. In addition to increasing the amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA; MVPA, the current PA guidelines recommend that adults should reduce SB, or any waking activity performed while sitting, reclining, or lying, with low energy expenditure. While mounting evidence has emphasized the benefits of increasing MVPA, little is focused on the effect of SB on health. Therefore, this review discusses the pathophysiological effects of SB and the potential physiological benefits of reducing/breaking up SB at the levels below the current guidelines for PA. Such knowledge is important, given the majority of the United States population performs insufficient or no MVPA and are at high risk of being negatively impacted by SB. Interventions targeting sedentary time, such as breaking up SB by standing and moving, may be safe, feasible, and applicable to execute daily for a wider range of the population. This review also discusses the importance of monitoring SB in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the clinical implications of sitting less and moving more.

AB  - Thrombotic events are common complications in COVID-19 patients that include both thrombus formation in large vessels and the microvasculature of the lung and other organs. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have similarities and differences, and whether CAC is a form of DIC is the subject of debate. Reported mechanisms of CAC include activated coagulation, endotheliopathy, up-regulated innate and adaptive immunity, and activated complement system. Although the clinical features and laboratory findings of CAC and DIC seem different, there are fundamental similarities that should be considered. Basically, the pathological findings of COVID-19 fall within the scope of the definition of DIC, i.e., systemic activation of coagulation caused by or resulting from the microvascular damage. Therefore, we suggest that although CAC differs from usual infection-associated DIC, its various features indicate that it can be considered a thrombotic phenotype DIC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about CAC including differences and similarities with sepsis-associated DIC.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently emanating human infectious coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease. On 11th March 2020, it has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Recently, several repositioned drugs have been subjected to clinical investigations as anti-COVID-19 drugs. Here, in silico drug discovery tools were utilized to evaluate the binding affinities and features of eighteen anti-COVID-19 drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Molecular docking calculations using Autodock Vina showed considerable binding affinities of the investigated drugs with docking scores ranging from - 5.3 to - 8.3 kcal/mol, with higher binding affinities for HIV drugs compared to the other antiviral drugs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for the predicted drug-Mpro complexes for 50 ns, followed by binding energy calculations utilizing molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach. MM-GBSA calculations demonstrated promising binding affinities of TMC-310911 and ritonavir towards SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with binding energy values of - 52.8 and - 49.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Surpass potentialities of TMC-310911 and ritonavir are returned to their capabilities of forming multiple hydrogen bonds with the proximal amino acids inside Mpro's binding site. Structural and energetic analyses involving root-mean-square deviation, binding energy per-frame, center-of-mass distance, and hydrogen bond length demonstrated the stability of TMC-310911 and ritonavir inside the Mpro's active site over the 50 ns MD simulation. This study sheds light on HIV protease drugs as prospective SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors.

AB  - Recently, various studied were presented to describe the population dynamic of covid-19. In this effort, we aim to introduce a different vitalization of the growth by using a controller term. Our method is based on the concept of conformable calculus, which involves this term. We investigate a system of coupled differential equations, which contains the dynamics of the diffusion among infected and asymptomatic characters. Strong control is considered due to the social separation. The result is consequently associated with a macroscopic law for the population. This dynamic system is useful to recognize the behavior of the growth rate of the infection and to confirm if its control is correctly functioning. A unique solution is studied under self-mapping properties. The periodicity of the solution is examined by using integral control and the optimal control is discussed in the sequel.

AB  - UNSTRUCTURED: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global disturbance by affecting more than forty-two million people (as of the end of October 2020). Since there is no medication or vaccine available, the only way to combat it is to prevent it from spreading as much as possible. Digital contact tracing is an effective technique that can be utilized for this purpose, as it eliminates the manual contact tracing process and would help in identifying and isolating the affected people. However, the users are reluctant to share their location and contacts details because of the concerns related to the privacy and security of their personal information which affects its implementation and extensive adoption. The blockchain technology has been applied in various domains and has proven to be an effective approach for handling data transactions in secure manner, which makes it an ideal choice for digital contact tracing applications. The properties of blockchain such as time stamping and immutability of the data would help in getting the accurate information regarding the trail of the virus in a transparent manner, while cryptography of data assures the integrity of information being provided. Furthermore, the anonymity of the user identities alleviates some of the risks related to the privacy and confidentiality of the users. In this paper, we provide the users with the detailed discussion on the digital contact tracing mechanism and discusses about the applications developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have presented the possible risks, issues and challenges associated with the available contact tracing applications and analyzed how the adoption of blockchain-based decentralized network for handling the application could provide the users with the privacy preserving contact tracing without compromising the performance efficiency.

AB  - Masks, now recommended and worn by a growing proportion of the world's population, have reflected various perceived meaning across time. This paper provides a brief history of the socio-cultural perceptions attached to wearing a mask by surveying how masks were perceived in ancient Greece and Rome, the origins of medical masks, and the ascribed socio-cultural meaning of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of a mask has historically diverse perceived meanings; currently, wearing a mask communicates a bipolar socio-cultural meaning and a nuanced, divisive symbology. To some, masks communicate a belief in medical science and a desire to protect one's neighbor from contagion. To others, a mask communicates oppression, government overreach, and a skepticism toward established scientific principles. It is the mask's ability to signal a deception, or extrapolated more broadly, a value system, that is highly relevant to current public health guidelines encouraging mask use to decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health officials and providers should utilize evidence-based health communication strategies when findings warrant a reversed recommendation of a symbol (such as masks) with a legacy of socio-cultural underpinnings that are deep-seated, complex, and emotional.

AB  - "Novel Corona Virus" (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease spreading all around the world that has a globally significant morbidity and mortality at present. Nurses as frontline care providers in hospitals and community are exposed to a major risk. This brief report aims at providing an overview of COVID-19 impacts on Sri Lanka and to highlight educational implications from the perspective of nursing degree programs. The major impacts of COVID-19 on nursing education were unequal access to online distance learning, disruption of academic calendars, cancellation of clinical placements, teaching and learning gap, lack of facilities for online learning, disruption towards professional development, and inability to conduct proper clinical assessments and standard operationalization procedures. It suggests that higher education institutions should take actions to provide material support for students from low-income households to close the gap between teaching and learning and training academics on different online teaching and learning strategies and assessments.

AB  - As more insight is gained into personalized health care, the importance of personalized nutritional and behavioral approaches is even more relevant in the COVID-19 era, in addition to the need for further elucidation regarding several diseases/conditions. One of these concerning body composition (in this context; bone, lean and adipose tissue) is osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA) syndrome. OSA occurs most often with aging, but also in cases of some chronic diseases and is exacerbated with the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI). OSA has been associated with poor nutrition, metabolic disorders and diminished functional abilities. This paper addresses various influences on OSA and LGCI, as well as their mutual action on each other, and provides nutritional and behavioral approaches which could be personalized to help with either preventing or managing OSA and LGCI in general, and specifically in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressed in more detail are nutritional recommendations for and roles of macro- and micronutrients and bioactive food components; the microbiome; and optimal physical activity regimens. Other issues, such as food insecurity and nutritional inadequacy, circadian misalignment and shift workers are addressed as well. Since there is still a lack of longer-term primary studies in COVID-19 patients (either acute or recovered) and interventions for OSA improvement, this discussion is based on the existing knowledge, scientific hypotheses and observations derived from similar conditions or studies just being published at the time of this writing.

These two viruses are different in the transmission mode and in the symptoms they generate. However, they have important similarities: the fear in the population, increase in proinflammatory cytokines that generate intestinal microbiota modifications or NETosis production by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, among others. They have been implicated in the clinical, prognostic and therapeutic attitudes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In many facilities, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused suspension of elective surgery. We therefore sought to determine the impact of this on the surgical experience of vascular trainees. METHODS: Surgical case volume, breadth, and the participating trainee post-graduate level from 3 large New York City Hospitals with integrated residency and fellowship programs (Mount Sinai, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and New York University) were reviewed. Procedures performed between February 26 to March 25, 2020 (pre-pandemic month) and March 26 to April 25, 2020 (peak pandemic period) were compared to those performed during the same time period in 2019. The trainees from these programs were also sent surveys to evaluate their subjective experience during this time. RESULTS: The total number of cases during the month leading into the peak pandemic period was 635 cases in 2019 and 560 cases in 2020 (12% decrease). During the peak pandemic period, case volume decreased from 445 in 2019 to 114 in 2020 (74% reduction). The highest volume procedures during the peak pandemic month in 2020 were amputations and peripheral cases for acute limb ischemia; during the 2019 period, the most common cases were therapeutic endovascular procedures. There was a decrease in case volume for vascular senior residents of 77% and vascular junior and midlevel residents of 75%. There was a 77% survey response rate with 50% of respondents in the senior years of training. Overall, 20% of respondents expressed concern about completing ACGME requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgery-specific clinical educational and operative experiences during redeployment efforts have been limited. Further efforts should be directed to quantify the impact on training and to evaluate the efficacy of training supplements such as teleconferences and simulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted surgical training nationwide. Our former curricula will likely not return, and training will need to adapt, so we are able to graduate residents of the same caliber as prior to the pandemic. METHODS: A survey evaluating perceptions of changes made in surgical training was conducted on surgery residents and attendings. RESULTS: Disaster medicine training has become more relevant and 85% residents and 75% attendings agreed it should be incorporated into the curriculum. Safety of family was the most significant concern of residents. Virtual curriculum was perceived to be acceptable by 82% residents and only 22% attendings (p < 0.01). Residents (37%) were less concerned than attendings (61%) of falling behind on their overall training (p = 0.04). Both groups agreed operative skills would be adversely affected (56%vs72%; p = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: To maintain an effective surgical curriculum, programs will need to implement new educational components to better prepare residents to become surgeons of the future.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death (>80%) in patients severely impacted by COVID-19. The lack of clinically effective therapies for COVID-19 calls for the consideration of novel adjunct therapeutic approaches. Though novel antiviral treatments and vaccination hold promise in control and prevention of early disease, it is noteworthy that in severe cases of COVID-19, addressing "run-away" inflammatory cascades are likely more relevant for improvement of clinical outcomes. Viral loads may decrease in severe, end-stage coronavirus cases, but a systemically damaging cytokine storm persists and mediates multiple organ injury. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) of the limbs has shown potential in recent years to protect the lungs and other organs against pathological conditions similar to that observed in COVID-19. We review the efficacy of RIC in protecting the lungs against acute injury and current points of consideration. The beneficial effects of RIC on lung injury along with other related cardiovascular complications are discussed, as are the limitations presented by sex and ageing. This adjunct therapy is highly feasible, non-invasive, and proven to be safe in clinical conditions. If proven effective in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19, application in the clinical setting could be immediately implemented to improve outcomes.

Clinical logic suffered under pressure arising from an urgent need to confirm or exclude severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This is a generation's Hobbesian moment in which the public concern for safety and security from infection outweighs the pursuit of personal freedom. The strangeness of a world in which a minute particle wields superhuman power has generated its list of unlikely heroes and mendacious villains. As the year comes to an end, there are glimmers of light amid the gloom: the prospect of an effective vaccine, and life after the pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Healthy elderly, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease populations have been among the most affected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the direct effects of the virus, and numerous indirect effects now emerge and will have to be carefully assessed over time. METHODS: This article reviews the main articles that have been published so far about the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these particularly fragile populations. RESULTS: The pandemic associated to COVID-19 has shifted most of the health resources to the emergency area and has consequently left the three main medical areas dealing with the elderly population (oncology, time-dependent diseases and degenerative disease) temporarily "uncovered". In the phase following the emergency, it will be crucial to guarantee to each area the economic and organizational resources to quickly return to the level of support of the prepandemic state. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency phase represented a significant occasion of discussion on the possibilities of telemedicine which will inevitably become increasingly important, but all the limits of its use in the elderly population have to be considered. In the post-lockdown recovery phase, alongside the classic medical evaluation, the psychological evaluation must become even more important for doctors caring about people with cognitive decline as well as with their caregivers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The pandemic has implemented the need for new digital technologies as useful tools during the emergency and the long recovery phase that will follow. SARS-CoV-2 has strongly impacted stroke care with significant contraction in a number of patients treated. METHODS: This mini-review is an initiative of the "Digital Technologies, Web and Social Media Study Group" of the Italian Society of Neurology and briefly discusses digital tools for managing the acute phase and the rehabilitation after stroke, even considering the new apps that will improve the process of remote monitoring of patients after discharge at home. RESULTS: Telemedicine and digital technologies could play a role in each of the three stroke-belt stages: hyperacute treatment and reperfusion, acute care, etiological classification and secondary prevention and rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: The global emergency represented by the COVID-19 pandemic can be the stimulus to accelerate the digitalization process in the field of stroke for the use of new methods on a large scale.

AB  - Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (nCoV-19) has put an enormous burden on global public health. Millions of people were affected by this pandemic situation and as of now, no effective antiviral drug has been found for the management of this situation. Cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress, hypoxia and multi-organ failure are hallmark clinical conditions of this disease. Trials for several investigational and repurposed drugs are being conducted but none of them were found to be safe and effective. However, for the critically ill patient, plasma therapy, dexamethasone, and remdesivir are included in the treatment protocol. Since long time, various natural drugs have been used as antiviral agents in Indian and Chinese traditional medicines which can be explored as a potential therapeutic option in such situation, it is therefore speculated that proper screening and standardization of these medicines can be a breakthrough in the management and treatment of nCoV-19 infection. As natural products possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory properties and also specifically act on various viral enzymatic machinery and affect their replication process, thus they may be useful as alternatives in relieving symptoms and treatment of nCoV-19 infection. However, only on the basis of their traditional value, discriminate and off-label use of these natural drugs must be prevented and robust preclinical and clinical data along with appropriate guidelines are needed for them to enter into clinical practice.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged from Wuhan, has now become pandemic and the mortality rate is growing exponentially. Clinical complication and fatality rate is much higher for patients having co-morbid issues. Compromised immune response and hyper inflammation is hall mark of pathogenesis and major cause of mortality. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is a term used to affiliate the situation of hyper inflammation and therefore use of anti-cytokine and anti-inflammatory drugs is used to take care of this situation. Looking into the clinical benefit of these anti-inflammatory drugs, many of them enter into clinical trials. However, understanding the immunopathology of COVID-19 is important otherwise, indiscriminate use of these drugs could be fetal as there exists a very fine line of difference between viral clearing cytokines and inflammatory cytokines. If any drug suppresses the viral clearing cytokines, it will worsen the situation and hence, the use of these drugs must be based on the clinical condition, viral load, co-existing disease condition and severity of the infection.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify and highlight the positive and negative indirect environmental impacts of COVID-19, with a particular focus on the most affected economies (USA, China, Spain, and Italy). In this respect, the empirical and theoretical dimensions of the contents of those impacts are analyzed. Research findings reveal a significant relationship between contingency actions and positive indirect impacts such as air quality improvements, clean beaches, and the decline in environmental noise. Besides, negative indirect impacts also exist, such as the rise in waste level and curtailment in recycling, further threatening the physical spaces (land and water), besides air. It is expected that global businesses will revive in the near future (though slowly), but the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions during this short time span is not a sustainable way of environmental mitigation. Thus, long-term mitigation policies should be strengthened to cope with the undesirable deterioration of the environment. Research findings provide an up-to-date glimpse of the pandemic from the perspectives of current and future indirect environmental impacts and the post-pandemic situation. Finally, it is suggested to invent and prepare action plans to induce a sustainable economic and environmental future in the post-pandemic world scenario.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the face of growing modernity and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, open and distance learning (ODL) is considered to play an important role in increasing access to education worldwide. There is a robust evidence base demonstrating its cost effectiveness in comparison with conventional class-based teaching; however, the transition to this new paradigm of learning for nursing and midwifery courses has been difficult in low-income countries. While there are notable efforts to increase internet and education access to health care professionals, not much is known about ODL for nurses and midwives in East African countries. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to understand whether ODL programs for nursing and midwifery education exist, the drivers of their adoption, their implementation, the topics/courses covered, their acceptability, and their impacts in East African countries. METHODS: The scoping review methodology employs the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. Using an exploratory approach, a two-stage screening process consisting of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review will be used to determine the eligibility of articles. To be included, articles must report on an existing ODL initiative for nurses and midwives in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. All articles will be independently assessed for eligibility by pairs of reviewers, and all eligible articles will be abstracted and charted in duplicate using a standardized form. RESULTS: Details of ODL for nursing and midwifery education initiatives and study outcomes will be summarized in a table. The extracted data will undergo exploratory descriptive analysis, and the results will be classified into learner and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on ODL for nursing and midwifery education will inform the ongoing development and restructuring of health care professional education in East Africa amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In 2019 an outbreak occurred which resulted in a global pandemic. The causative agent has been identified in a virus belonging to theCoronaviridae family, similar to the agent of SARS, referred to as SARS-CoV-2. This epidemic spread rapidly globally with high morbidity and mortality. Although vaccine development is at a very advanced stage, there are currently no truly effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we present systematic and integrative antiviral drug repurposing effort aimed at identifying, among the drugs already authorized for clinical use, some active inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The most important result of this analysis is the demonstration that ethacrynic acid, a powerful diuretic, is revealed to be an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Even with all the necessary cautions, given the particular nature of this drug, these data can be the starting point for the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We examined the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cynomolgus macaques for 28 days to establish an animal model of COVID-19 for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed body temperature rises and X-ray radiographic pneumonia without life-threatening clinical signs of disease. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes producing interferon (IFN)-γ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein were detected on day 14 in one of three macaques with viral pneumonia. In the other two macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes producing IFN-γ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14, suggesting that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of similar symptoms to approximately 80% of patients, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs for humans.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes findings up to date on the relationship between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19. Recent Findings: Preexisting CVD is a common condition among patients with COVID-19 and is associated with increased disease severity and mortality. Conversely, COVID-19 has various clinical manifestations on cardiovascular system, including thrombotic events and cardiac dysfunction. The pandemic has impacted healthcare utilization among patients with CVD, which may have led to potential delay in access to the healthcare system during acute events not directly COVID-19-related. Summary: While COVID-19 vaccine is being developed and distributed, controlling CVD risk factors and adherence to recommendations of existing immunization (e.g., influenza vaccine) are key in protecting the health of individuals with CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiological and pathophysiological basis for the interaction between CVD and COVID-19.

AB  - Introduction Each country's difference in the severity rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be explained by the difference in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, which affects the reactivity of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). Methods To clarify the relationship between HLA class I and the severity rate, the binding repertoires of each HLA class I allele to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and the allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B, and -A/B haplotypes in each country were quoted. Results HLA-A1 and the number of deaths per million population (severity rate) in each country had an exponential approximation correlation with correlation coefficient R=0.4879. In addition, the correlation between the infected cases per million (infection rate) and the severity rate was linearly approximated, with R=0.7422. Weak HLA-A alleles with a repertoire of under 300 also had an exponential approximation correlation with the severity rate (R=0.5972), whereas there was a linear approximation with the infection rate (R=0.6808). Weak HLA-B alleles of 30 repertoires or less had no correlation with the severity rate (R=-0.1530). The weak HLA-A/B haplotype has a stronger effect on the severity rate than the weak HLA-A alone. Therefore, the simple HLA class I susceptibility index was calculated, and a strong correlation (R=0.7388) of an exponential approximation with the severity rate was obtained. Conclusions HLA class I susceptible alleles against COVID-19 increase both infection and severity rate. The weak HLA-A is a major factor of severity rate, whereas the weak -B alone has no correlation. However, the weak HLA-A/B haplotype has a stronger effect on the severity rate than the weak -A alone.

AB  - Objectives: The use of Facebook (FB) to share and gather information on diabetes is commonplace but no data is available on its use among Filipinos during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine the engagement from instructional slide decks on diabetes and its management shown on two Philippine-based FB pages under the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). Methodology: We used Insights data from the slide decks and slide shows shown on the Philippine Society of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism's (PSEDM) public FB page and the Endocrine Witch's FB page. The slide set contained a mix of mostly images and text on COVID-19 and Diabetes, dietary advice, medications and self-care in the setting of the ECQ where access to insulin, ambulatory clinics and healthy food is limited. Data was summarized in terms of post clicks, reactions, shares and comments. Total engagement rate was computed. Results: We noted a high engagement rate (4-15%) in both public FB pages with higher engagement rates in slides shown in the Filipino language for most topics. The slides that gathered more shares and reactions were primarily those containing general information on COVID-19 and diabetes, nutrition including the safety of canned goods, as well as sick day rules. Conclusion: In the setting of the ECQ, the use of image and text-based slide-decks on the PSEDM and Endocrine Witch FB pages to communicate health information yielded high engagement.

AB  - Background and Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created serious concerns about its potential adverse effects. There are limited data on clinical, radiological, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to assess clinical manifestations and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a systematic article search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for studies that discussed pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and April 20, 2020, with no restriction on language. Articles were independently evaluated by two expert authors. We included all retrospective studies that reported the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Results: Forty-seven articles were assessed for eligibility; 13 articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Data is reported for 235 pregnant women with COVID-19. The age range of patients was 25-40 years, and the gestational age ranged from 8 to 40 weeks plus 6 days. Clinical characteristics were fever [138/235 (58.72%)], cough [111/235 (47.23%)], and sore throat [21/235 (8.93%)]. One hundred fifty six out of 235 (66.38%) pregnant women had cesarean section, and 79 (33.62%) had a vaginal delivery. All the patients showed lung abnormalities in CT scan images, and none of the patients died. Neutrophil cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, ALT, and AST were increased but lymphocyte count and albumin levels were decreased. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples were taken to test for SARS-CoV-2 but all found negativ results. Recent published evidence showed the possibility of vertical transmission up to 30%, and neonatal death up to 2.5%. Pre-eclampsia, fetal distress, PROM, pre-mature delivery were the major complications of pregnant women with COVID-19. Conclusions: Our study findings show that the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of the general populations. The possibility of vertical transmission cannot be ignored but C-section should not be routinely recommended anymore according to latest evidences and, in any case, decisions should be taken after proper discussion with the family. Future studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings with a larger number of sample sizes and a long-term follow-up period.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global emergence, and the absence of a proven vaccine or medicine has led to the implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of the virus. Wearing protective equipment like mask and gloves, washing hands via soap, frequent use of antiseptic solution and maintaining social distance are being applied globally to reduce the transmission rate. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective. Moreover, the WASH and waste disposal practices of the marginal people were found very poor and not at a satisfactory level. The results of statistical analysis focused on WASH and waste disposal practices as well as the factors which influence these practices. It is found that gender, occupation, area of residence, and level of education of the participants mainly influence the WASH and waste disposal practices. It is expected that this study exposed the necessity to introduce proper infectious waste management policy and also the increase in awareness level among mass people regarding the preventive measures of COVID-19 infection to combat against disease transmission and environmental pollution.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 disease pandemic has infected millions of people and caused more than thousands of deaths in many countries across the world. The number of infected cases is increasing day by day. Unfortunately, we do not have a vaccine and specific treatment for it. Along with the protective measures, respiratory and/or circulatory supports and some antiviral and retroviral drugs have been used against SARS-CoV-2, but there are no more extensive studies proving their efficacy. In this study, the latest publications in the field have been reviewed, focusing on the modulatory effects on the immunity of some natural antiviral dietary supplements, vitamins and minerals. Findings suggest that several dietary supplements, including black seeds, garlic, ginger, cranberry, orange, omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins (e.g., A, B vitamins, C, D, E), and minerals (e.g., Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Se, Zn) have anti-viral effects. Many of them act against various species of respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses. Therefore, dietary supplements, including vitamins and minerals, probiotics as well as individual nutritional behaviour can be used as adjuvant therapy together with antiviral medicines in the management of COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Since the announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of a contagious respiratory viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (later named as COVID-19), several research works have been carried out to unstitch the therapeutic options and combat the disease using various aproaches and modalities. These works are currently at different clinical trial stages, and their results may be determined by the outcome of the ongoing trial process. There is the need for a collection of information regarding the availlable therapeutic options related to COVID-19. this article therefore reviewed emerging and re-emerging therapeutic compounds/drugs used in COVID-19 management and reports of clinical trials, with the view to summarize and highlight their prospect and possible adverse effects to allow more extensive choice by clinicians, researchers, and policymakers. The approach used involved retrieval of related collections found in selected repositories including, Medline, Scopus, PubMed, and Google scholar. Only experimental or clinical studies were included. Out of the 39 materials retrieved, 26 (66.67%) studies were based on clinical trials, 12 (30.77%) were classified as in vitro studies, and only one (2.56%) involved experimental animal study. Of the agents evaluated for COVID-19 therapeutics, 15 (38.46%) were anti-viral, four (10.26%) antimalarial, four studies were immunotherapeutics (10.26%), two studies (5.13%) were antibacterial, while, one (2.56%) study wasfor antiparasitic , anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral/antimalarial, and anti-viral/herbal combination for each. Also, eight studies (20.51%) were antibiotic/antimalarial.. This review indicates that there is both a race and quest in the test of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and that arbidol seems to have dominated in the studies analyzed. The use of anticoagulants and antibiotics, such as teicoplanin and azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine were reported to also play a leading role in the management of the disease. Likewise, dexamethasone has been recently claimed to be effective in patients in need of respiratory assistance. Based on unresolved controversies and inconclusive findings, it could be said that generally, a single and specific therapeutics to COVID-19 is still a mirage. There is, thus, an urgent need to test more potent compounds and agents to establish much safer and highly efficacious drugs/agents for the disease, even as we continue to learn more about the disease as well as the characteristic of the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Background: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is currently the most widely used method for testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, false negatives and the sensitivity of this mode of testing have been problematic for accurately estimating the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. OBJECTIVE: Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether technical and, therefore, correctable errors were being made with regards to nasopharyngeal swab procedure. METHODS: Methods: Online video database (YouTube) was queried for SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab tests from January 1 to May 15, 2020. Videos were rated by three blinded rhinologists for accuracy of swab angle and depth. The overall score respectively for swab angle and swab depth for each NPS video was determined by the majority score with agreement among at least two out of three reviewers. Video data between YouTube videos with correct NPS technique and videos with incorrect NPS technique were compared. Multiple linear regression analysis with statistical significance set at P=0.05 was used to determine video data variables associated with correct NPS technique. RESULTS: Results: 126 videos met inclusion and exclusion criteria. 52% (N=66) of total NPS videos were determined to have correct angle while 46% (N=58) showed appropriate depth. 44% (N=57) of videos had both correct NPS angle and appropriate depth while 48% (N=59) of videos had both incorrect NPS angle and inappropriate depth. Videos with correct NPS technique were associated with the swab operator identifying as a medical professional and as an ENT-related medical professional. Correct NPS technique was also associated with more recent video publication date relative to May 15, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusion: Greater attention needs to be given towards educating frontline healthcare workers performing NPS, as this study shows that over half of videos documenting NPS show incorrect technique, which could elevate false negative rates.

AB  - As coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases continue to increase in Africa, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a high risk of being infected and the risks may be higher among those who work closely with patients. The risks of HCW infections can be mitigated with adequate precautions within healthcare facilities, especially with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We highlight and contextualise the findings of a Cochrane review on the type of PPE that protects best, the best way to put PPE on (donning) or to remove PPE (doffing) and how to train HCWs to use PPE. The review found low-certainty of evidence that full body PPE offer more protection, but HCWs may be faced with difficulty during donning and doffing. Following standard guidelines may be helpful in reducing infection and increasing compliance among HCWs. Video training and simulations may be better methods for training on the correct use of PPE than traditional methods of teaching. Countries must, therefore, ensure that HCWs undergo compulsory training on the correct use of PPE; regardless of their professional category. Of the 24 studies included in this review, none was conducted on the African continent. There is thus an urgent need for well conducted studies on the experiences of HCWs using full-body covering PPE within the African context. Such studies could lead to tailored interventions that will improve the proper use of PPE among HCWs.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, infiltrating, infecting, and devastating communities in all locations of varying demographics. An overwhelming majority of published literature on the pathologic findings associated with COVID-19 is either from living clinical cohorts or from autopsy findings of those who died in a medical care setting, which can confound pure disease pathology. A relatively low initial infection rate paired with a high biosafety level enabled the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator to conduct full autopsy examinations on suspected COVID-19-related deaths. Full autopsy examination on the first 20 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive decedents revealed that some extent of diffuse alveolar damage in every death due to COVID-19 played some role. The average decedent was middle-aged, male, American Indian, and overweight with comorbidities that included diabetes, ethanolism, and atherosclerotic and/or hypertensive cardiovascular disease. Macroscopic thrombotic events were seen in 35% of cases consisting of pulmonary thromboemboli and coronary artery thrombi. In 2 cases, severe bacterial coinfections were seen in the lungs. Those determined to die with but not of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection had unremarkable lung findings.

AB  - The emerging novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 presents with high infectivity, morbidity and mortality. It presenting a need for immediate understanding of its pathogenicity. Inflammation and coagulation systems are over-activated in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 damages endothelial cell and pneumocyte, resulting in hemostatic disorder and ARDS. An influential biomarkers of poor outcome in COVID-19 are high circulating cytokines and D-dimer level. This latter is due to hyper-fibrinolysis and hyper-coagulation. Plasmin is a key player in fibrinolysis and is involved in the cleavage of many viruses envelop proteins, including SARS-CoV. This function is similar to that of TMPRSS2, which underpins the entry of viruses into the host cell. In addition, plasmin is involved in the pathophysiology of ARDS in SARS and promotes secretion of cytokine, such as IL-6 and TNF, from activated macrophages. Here, we suggest an out-of-the-box treatment for alleviating fibrinolysis and the ARDS of COVID-19 patients. This proposed treatment is concomitant administration of an anti-fibrinolytic drug and the anticoagulant.

AB  - In a large-scale study, 128176 non-pregnant patients (228 studies) and 10000 pregnant patients (121 studies) confirmed COVID-19 cases included in this Meta-Analysis. The mean (confidence interval [CI]) of age and gestational age of admission (GA) in pregnant women was 33 (28-37) years old and 36 (34-37) weeks, respectively. Pregnant women show the same manifestations of COVID-19 as non-pregnant adult patients. Fever (pregnant: 75.5%; non-pregnant: 74%) and cough (pregnant: 48.5%; non-pregnant: 53.5%) are the most common symptoms in both groups followed by myalgia (26.5%) and chill (25%) in pregnant and dysgeusia (27%) and fatigue (26.5%) in non-pregnant patients. Pregnant women are less probable to show cough (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.67-0.75), fatigue (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.54-0.61), sore throat (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.61-0.7), headache (OR: 0.55; CI: 0.55-0.58) and diarrhea (OR: 0.46; CI: 0.4-0.51) than non-pregnant adult patients. The most common imaging found in pregnant women is ground-glass opacity (57%) and in non-pregnant patients is consolidation (76%). Pregnant women have higher proportion of leukocytosis (27% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 12.5%) and have lower proportion of raised C-reactive protein (52% vs. 81%) compared with non-pregnant patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are almost the same in both groups. The most common comorbidity in pregnant patients is diabetes (18%) and in non-pregnant patients is hypertension (21%). Case fatality rate (CFR) of non-pregnant hospitalized patients is 6.4% (4.4-8.5), and mortality due to all-cause for pregnant patients is 11.3% (9.6-13.3). Regarding the complications of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage (54.5% [7-94]), caesarean delivery (48% [42-54]), preterm labor (25% [4-74]) and preterm birth (21% [12-34]) are in turn the most prevalent complications. Comparing the pregnancy outcomes show that caesarean delivery (OR: 3; CI: 2-5), low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 9; CI: 2.4-30) and preterm birth (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.5-3.5) are more probable in pregnant woman with COVID-19 than pregnant women without COVID-19. The most prevalent neonatal complications are neonatal intensive care unit admission (43% [2-96]), fetal distress (30% [12-58]) and LBW (25% [16-37]). The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3-16), and the rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 is 8% (4-16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID-19 suggest a possible association between COVID-19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID-19 pregnant patients.

AB  - Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) develop acute exacerbations (AE), with varying natural history. The exacerbation is triggered by infection, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The study on infectious aetiology of AECOPD is largely restricted to only viral or only bacterial aetiology. There are no studies from India that have investigated multiple viral, bacterial, and fungal associations from the same group of patients. This prospective study was conducted over 2 years to estimate the incidence and profile of viral infections in AECOPD patients, their coinfection with other bacterial and fungal agents, and association of the type and pattern of infective agent with the clinical severity. Materials and Methods: Seventy-four AECOPD cases were included in the study. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed from nasopharyngeal swab using Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogens 21 Plus Kit. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, Modified ZN, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount were performed for Mycobacteria, Nocardia, and fungal elements. Bacterial cultures and fungal cultures were done as per the standard techniques. Serum samples were tested for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia pneumoniae immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The number of AECOPD events involving only viral infection, only bacterial infection, bacterial-viral coinfection, and no infection were 43 (58.1%), 32 (43.2%), 20 (27%), and 19 (25.7%), respectively. Influenza A virus was the most common virus (22/43, 51%) identified. In 26 patients, monoviral infections were found, and in 17 patients, polyviral infections were identified, the most common pattern being influenza A and B virus, followed by human rhinovirus and human parainfluenza. The most common bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/32,28%) followed by Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7/32, 21%). Among the viral-bacterial coinfection, human coronavirus NL63 infection was always associated with a bacterial infection. Conclusion: This information on the various viral and bacterial etiologies of respiratory infections in AECOPD in this part of India will improve the understanding of the management of AECOPD using a timely institution of antivirals and reduce the overuse of antibiotics and the implementation of routine influenza vaccination.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the face of education for undergraduate and graduate medical trainees. Lectures, clinical clerkships, and testing have all been impacted significantly because of patient care needs and concern for the health and safety of trainees. While traditional teaching strategies have been upended, the challenges posed by the pandemic have also created unique opportunities for trainees. In this article, the authors summarize lessons trainees can learn from the ongoing pandemic in the following areas: public health, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation; reinventing professional and personal roles to meet the needs of the health care system; flexibility in navigating testing, licensure, and certification; appraising scientific evidence quickly and accurately; balancing a physician's call to duty with fear for personal safety; combating moral injury; interprofessional collaboration; and advocating for oneself and colleagues. Focusing on these lessons can help educators steer their efforts to better prepare future physicians for unforeseen challenges that may come up in their personal and professional lives as well as in society as a whole.

AB  - PRECIS: Designing and demonstrating an experiment that shows the risk of airborne transmission of COVID 19 between patients having visual fields analysed is low. PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 during Humphrey Visual field testing in a real-world scenario. METHODS: A particle counter was placed within the bowl of Humphrey Visual Field Analyser before and after turning on the machine to ascertain the effect of the air current produced by the ventilation system on aerosols. A second experiment was run where the particle counter was placed in the bowl and recorded particulates, in the air, as a 24-2 SITA standard was performed by a mock patient and then again immediately after the patient had moved away. We measured aerosol particle counts sized ≤0.3▒μm, >0.3 ≤0.5▒μm, >0.5 ≤1▒μm, >1 ≤2.5▒μm, >2.5≤5▒μm and >5≤10▒μm. RESULTS: Particulates of all sizes were shown to be significantly reduced within the bowl after turning the machine on, demonstrating that the air current produced by the Humphrey visual field analyser pushes air out of the bowl and it cannot stagnate. There was no significant difference in measurement of aerosol while there was a patient performing the test and immediately after they had moved away, suggesting that aerosols breathed out by the patient are not able to remain in suspension in the bowl due to the ventilation current. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between aerosol count in the bowl of a Humphrey visual field analyser before, during and after testing. This suggests the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is low between subsequent patients. This is in keeping with manufacturer's guidance on Humphrey visual field testing.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic has spread over in 213 countries as of July 2020. Approximately 12 million people have been infected so far according to the reports from World Health Organization (WHO). Preventive measures are being taken globally to avoid the rapid spread of virus. In the current study, an in silico approach is carried out as a means of inhibiting the spike protein of the novel coronavirus by flavonoids from natural sources that possess both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. The methodology is focused on molecular docking of 10 flavonoid compounds that are docked with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, to determine the highest binding affinity at the binding site. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out with the flavonoid-protein complex showing the highest binding affinity and highest interactions. The flavonoid naringin showed the least binding energy of -9.8 Kcal/mol with the spike protein which was compared with the standard drug, dexamethasone which is being repurposed to treat critically ill patients. MD simulation was carried out on naringin-spike protein complex for their conformational stability in the active site of the novel coronavirus spike protein. The RMSD of the complex appeared to be more stable when compared to that of the protein from 0.2 nm to 0.4 nm. With the aid of this in silico approach further in vitro studies can be carried out on these flavonoids against the novel coronavirus as a means of viral protein inhibitors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Translating research into practice is a central priority within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap. The underlying aim of the NIH Roadmap is to accelerate the movement of scientific findings into practical health care provisions through translational research. MAIN TEXT: Despite the advances in health sciences, emerging infectious diseases have become more frequent in recent decades. Furthermore, emerging and reemerging pathogens have led to several global public health challenges. A question, and to an extent a concern, arises from this: Why our health care system is experiencing several challenges in encountering the coronavirus outbreak, despite the ever-growing advances in sciences, and the exponential rise in the number of published articles in the first quartile journals and even the ones among the top 1%? CONCLUSION: Two responses could be potentially provided to the above question: First, there seems to be a significant gap between our theoretical knowledge and practice. And second that many scholars and scientists publish papers only to have a longer list of publications, and therefore publishing is viewed as a personal objective, rather than for improving communities' public health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has thrust video consulting into the limelight, as health care practitioners around the world shift to delivering care remotely. Evidence suggests that video consulting is acceptable, safe and effective in selected conditions and settings. However, research to date has mostly focused on initial adoption with limited consideration of how video consulting can be mainstreamed and sustained. OBJECTIVE: The study sought to (a) review and synthesize reported opportunities, challenges and lessons learnt in the scale-up, spread, and sustainability of video consultations, and (b) identify transferable insights that can inform policy and practice. METHODS: We identified papers through systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL and Web of Science. Included articles reported on synchronous, video-based consultations that had spread to more than one setting beyond an initial pilot or feasibility stage, and were published since 2010. We used the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to synthesise findings relating to 7 domains: an understanding of the health condition(s) for which video consultations were being used, the material properties of the technological platform and relevant peripherals, the value proposition for patients and developers, the role of the adopter system, organisational factors, wider macro-level considerations, as well as emergence over time. RESULTS: We identified 13 papers describing 10 different video consultation services in 6 regions, covering (i) video-to-home services, connecting providers directly to the patient; (ii) hub-and-spoke models, connecting a provider at a central hub to a patient at a rural centre; and (iii) large-scale top-down evaluations scaled-up or spread across a national health administration. Services covered rehabilitation, geriatrics, cancer surgery, diabetes, and mental health, and general specialist care and primary care. Potential enablers to spread and scale-up included embedded leadership and the presence of a telehealth champion, appropriate reimbursement mechanisms, user-friendly technology, pre-existing staff relationships, and adaptation (of technology and services) over time. Challenges tended to focus on service development, such as the absence of a long-term strategic plan, resistance to change, cost and reimbursement issues and technical experience of staff. There was limited articulation of the challenges to scale-up and spread of video consultations. This was combined with a lack of theorization, with papers tending to view spread and scale-up as the sum of multiple technical implementations, rather than theorising the distinct processes required to achieve widespread adoption. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a significant lack of evidence that can support spread and scale-up of video consulting. Given the recent pace of change due to Covid-19, a more definitive evidence base is urgently needed that can support global efforts and match enthusiasm for extending use. CLINICALTRIAL:

AB  - With the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the world has been facing an unprecedented challenge. Considering the lack of appropriate therapy for COVID-19, it is crucial to develop effective treatments instead of supportive approaches. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as multipotent stromal cells have been shown to possess treating potency through inhibiting or modulating the pathological events in COVID-19. MSCs and their exosomes participate in immunomodulation by controlling cell-mediated immunity and cytokine release. Furthermore, they repair the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) malfunction, increase alveolar fluid clearance, and reduce the chance of hypercoagulation. Besides the lung, which is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, the heart, kidney, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract are also affected by COVID-19. Thus, the efficacy of targeting these organs via different delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes should be evaluated to ensure safe and effective MSCs administration in COVID-19. This review focuses on the proposed therapeutic mechanisms and delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes to the damaged organs. It also discusses the possible application of primed and genetically modified MSCs as a promising drug delivery system in COVID-19. Moreover, the recent advances in the clinical trials of MSCs and MSCs-derived exosomes as one of the promising therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 have been reviewed.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than 50 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths worldwide as of November 2020. Currently, there are no effective antivirals approved by the Food and Drug Administration to contain this pandemic except the antiviral agent remdesivir. In addition, the trimeric spike protein on the viral surface is highly glycosylated and almost 200,000 variants with mutations at more than 1,000 positions in its 1,273 amino acid sequence were reported, posing a major challenge in the development of antibodies and vaccines. It is therefore urgently needed to have alternative and timely treatments for the disease. In this study, we used a cell-based infection assay to screen more than 3,000 agents used in humans and animals, including 2,855 small molecules and 190 traditional herbal medicines, and identified 15 active small molecules in concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 50 μM. Two enzymatic assays, along with molecular modeling, were then developed to confirm those targeting the virus 3CL protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Several water extracts of herbal medicines were active in the cell-based assay and could be further developed as plant-derived anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Some of the active compounds identified in the screen were further tested in vivo, and it was found that mefloquine, nelfinavir, and extracts of Ganoderma lucidum (RF3), Perilla frutescens, and Mentha haplocalyx were effective in a challenge study using hamsters as disease model.

AB  - Influenza virus and coronavirus, belonging to enveloped RNA viruses, are major causes of human respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan (λ-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses with EC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 μg/ml, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with an EC50 value of 0.9 ± 1.1 μg/ml. No toxicity to the host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 μg/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that λ-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing virus entry. Moreover, its intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, λ-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection with several respiratory viruses.

AB  - The recent outbreak of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) has had major global impact. The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and psychiatric diseases is of great concern, with an evident link between corona virus infections and various central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. Unmitigated neuro-inflammation has been noted to underlie not only the severe respiratory complications of the disease but is also present in a range of neuro-psychiatric illnesses. Several neurological and psychiatric disorders are characterized by immune-inflammatory states, while treatments for these disorders have distinct anti-inflammatory properties and effects. With inflammation being a common contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2, as well as psychiatric disorders, treatment of either condition may affect disease progression of the other or alter response to pharmacological treatment. In this review, we elucidate how viral infections could affect pre-existing psychiatric conditions and how pharmacological treatments of these conditions may affect overall progress and outcome in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. We address whether any treatment-induced benefits and potential adverse effects may ultimately affect the overall treatment approach, considering the underlying dysregulated neuro-inflammatory processes and potential drug interactions. Finally, we suggest adjunctive treatment options for SARS-CoV-2-associated neuro-psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - With the advent of biologicals, more and more therapeutics are available that specifically address specific switch points in the pathomechanism of immunologically dominated diseases. Thus, the focus of diagnostics and therapy (precision medicine) is more on the individual disease characteristics of the individual patient. Regarding the different phenotypes of atopic diseases, severe asthma was the first entity for which biologicals were approved, followed by urticaria, and finally atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Experience in the treatment of severe bronchial asthma has shown that the intensity of the response to biological therapy depends on the quality of clinical and immunological phenotyping of the patients. This also applies to different diseases of the atopic form, as patients can suffer from several atopic diseases at the same time, each with different characteristics. Biologics are already emerging that may represent a suitable therapy for allergic bronchial asthma, which often occurs together with severe neurodermatitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In practice, however, the question of possible combinations of biologicals for the therapy of complex clinical pictures of individual patients is increasingly arising. In doing so, the side effect profile must be taken into account, including hypersensitivity reactions, whose diagnostic and logistical management must aim at a safe and efficient therapy of the underlying disease. Increased attention must also be paid to biological therapy in pregnancy and planned (predictable) vaccinations as well as existing infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Before starting a biological therapy, the immune status should be checked with regard to chronic viral and bacterial infections and, if necessary, the vaccination status should be refreshed or missing vaccinations should be made up for before starting therapy. Currently, reliable data on the effect of biologicals on the immunological situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 are not available. Therefore, research and development of suitable diagnostic methods for detection of immunologically caused side effects as well as detection of potential therapy responders and non-responders is of great importance.

AB  - Pandemic outbreaks can cause diverse impacts on society by altering human-nature relations. This study analyzed these relational changes during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Swine flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola outbreaks by applying machine learning and big data analyses of global news articles. The results showed that social-ecological systems play vital roles in analyzing indirect pandemic impacts. Herein, major pandemic impacts, including reduced use of cultural ecosystem services, can be analyzed by big data analyses at the global scale. All the identified pandemic impacts herein were linked to provisioning and cultural ecosystem services, implying that these ecosystem services might be more recognized or valued more by the public than regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Further, the pandemic impacts were presented with human-centric views, indicating a challenge to adapting nature-based solutions to mitigate the risk of future pandemic emergences. These findings will advance the current knowledge of diverse pandemic impacts and human-nature relations.

AB  - Aim: COVID-19 has led to a global crisis not only in the health sector but also in the economic, social and education sectors, as well as the lives of common man. This paper reviews the origin, characteristics and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus and the preventive measures adopted by the world's nations to curb the effects of the pandemic. Subjects and methods: The temporal and spatial profile of the COVID-19 spread is highly dynamic and is progressively changing at a rapid pace. This article is an attempt to mitigate the pandemic threat by sharing the review outcome from an extensive literature survey on recent articles on COVID-19 and its impact. Results: Statistical analysis presented by the World Health Organization and other health organizations explicitly indicates that optimized support and care extended to infected persons is the key to therapy, and the clinical effectiveness of alternative techniques is still under study. Though there have been announcements on the discovery of drugs for the virus, the authenticity of these reports are yet to be verified. Conclusion: Based on the review, it can be inferred that it is important to boost one's immune system and to stay healthy by developing healthy habits of food intake, sleep, exercise, personal hygiene and so on. Practicing social distancing with a self-motivated attitude will help to control the virus to a large extent. The current situation also demands a great sense of responsibility of people towards society by protecting oneself from the virus in order to protect the society one lives in.

AB  - The UK implemented a lockdown in Spring (2020) to curtail the person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Measures restricted movements to one outing per day for exercise and shopping, otherwise most people were restricted to their dwelling except for key workers (e.g. medical, supermarkets, and transport). In this study, we quantified changes to air quality across the United Kingdom from 30/03/2020 to 03/05/2020 (weeks 14-18), the period of most stringent travel restrictions. Daily pollutant measurements of NO2, O3 and PM2.5 from the national network of monitoring sites during this period were compared with measurements over the same period during 2017-19. Comparisons were also made with predicted concentrations for the 2020 period from business-as-usual (BAU) modelling, where the contributions of normal anthropogenic activities were estimated under the observed meteorological conditions. During the lockdown study period there was a 69% reduction in traffic overall (74% reduction in light and 35% in heavy vehicles). Measurements from 129 monitoring stations, identified mean reductions in NO2 of 38.3% (-8.8 μg/m3) and PM2.5 of 16.5% (-2.2 μg/m3). Improvements in NO2 and PM2.5 were largest at urban traffic sites and more modest at background locations where a large proportion of the population live. In contrast, O3 concentrations on average increased by 7.6% (+4.8 μg/m3) with the largest increases at roadside sites due to reductions in local emissions of NO. A lack of VOC monitoring limited our capacity to interpret changes in O3 at urban background locations. BAU models predicted comparable NO2 reductions and O3 gains, although PM2.5 episodes would have been more prominent without lockdown. Results demonstrate the relatively modest contribution of traffic to air quality, suggesting that sustained improvements in air quality require actions across various sectors, including working with international and European initiatives on long-range transport air pollutants, especially PM2.5 and O3.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular toxicity as a consequence of nicotine from conventional tobacco cigarette smoking is well documented. However, little is known about the cardiovascular consequences of nicotine e-vaping. We review the literature and report a case series of three cases of major adverse cardiovascular clinical effects post nicotine e-vaping. Case summary: Three patients with known peripheral arterial disease who switched from heavy cigarette smoking consumption to a high-intensity dose of nicotine e-vaping all developed further arterial complications within 6-30 months. Discussion: With the recent epidemic of e-vaping in young individuals and the national outbreak of e-vaping use-associated lung injury (EVALI), the dangers of e-vaping are now coming to light. The pulmonary effects are now well described, and this paper highlights three new cases of cardiovascular toxicity associated with e-vaping. The potential role of nicotine e-vaping and the risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) will also be discussed.

AB  - The naturally isolated avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) generally cannot replicate in chicken kidney (CK) cells. To explore the molecular mechanism of IBV adapting to CK cells, a series of recombinant viruses were constructed by chimerizing the S genes of CK cell-adapted strain H120 and non-adapted strain IBYZ. The results showed that the S2 subunit determines the difference in cell tropism of the two strains. After comparing the amino acid sequences of S protein of CK cell-adapted strain YZ120, with its parental strain IBYZ, three amino acid substitutions, A138V, L581F, and V617I, were identified. Using YZ120 as the backbone, one or more of the above-mentioned substitutions were eliminated to verify the correlation between these sites and CK cell tropism. The results showed that the CK cell tropism of the YZ120 strain depends on the V617I substitution, the change of L581F promoted the adaptation in CK cells, and the change at 138 position was not directly related to the CK cell tropism. Further validation experiments also showed that V617I had a decisive role in the adaptation of IBV to CK cells, but other areas of the virus genome also affected the replication efficiency of the virus in CK cells.

AB  - During major infectious disease outbreak, such as COVID-19, the goods and parcels supply and distribution for the isolated personnel has become a key issue worthy of attention. In this study, we propose a delivery problem that arises in the last-mile delivery during major infectious disease outbreak. The problem is to construct a Hamiltonian tour over a subset of candidate parking nodes, and each customer is assigned to the nearest parking node on the tour to pick up goods or parcels. The aim is to minimize the total cost, including the routing, allocation, and parking costs. We propose three models to formulate the problem, which are node-based, flow-based and bilevel programing formulations. Moreover, we develop a variable neighborhood search algorithm based on the ideas from the bilevel programing formulations to solve the problem. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of randomly generated instances, and the results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Despite the fact that social distancing is an effective mean to slow the spread of COVID-19, individuals often fail to practice this behavior. Major US news media provided information to the public about social distancing after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, potentially spurring this preventative health practice. Using data from a representative sample of US residents, this study aims to understand the relationship between news media attention and social-distancing behavior via three potential mediators: perceived effectiveness of social distancing, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, and perceived negative consequences of infection. Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention's impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle. Overall, the study found news media to have an important role in promoting social-distancing behavior when they emphasized safety measures across the ideological spectrum.

AB  - A wide variety of symptoms is associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and these symptoms can overlap with other conditions and diseases. Knowing the distribution of symptoms across diseases and individuals can support clinical actions on timelines shorter than those for drug and vaccine development. Here, we focus on zinc deficiency symptoms, symptom overlap with other conditions, as well as zinc effects on immune health and mechanistic zinc deficiency risk groups. There are well-studied beneficial effects of zinc on the immune system including a decreased susceptibility to and improved clinical outcomes for infectious pathogens including multiple viruses. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress agent, relevant to some severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is common worldwide and not exclusive to the developing world. Lifestyle choices and preexisting conditions alone can result in zinc deficiency, and we compile zinc risk groups based on a review of the literature. It is also important to distinguish chronic zinc deficiency from deficiency acquired upon viral infection and immune response and their different supplementation strategies. Zinc is being considered as prophylactic or adjunct therapy for COVID-19, with 12 clinical trials underway, highlighting the relevance of this trace element for global pandemics. Using the example of zinc, we show that there is a critical need for a deeper understanding of essential trace elements in human health, and the resulting deficiency symptoms and their overlap with other conditions. This knowledge will directly support human immune health for decreasing susceptibility, shortening illness duration, and preventing progression to severe cases in the current and future pandemics.

AB  - The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses correlates inversely with human disease severity, suggesting T cell involvement in primary control. Whereas many COVID-19 vaccines focus on establishing humoral immunity to viral spike protein, vaccine-elicited T cell immunity may bolster durable protection or cross-reactivity with viral variants. To better enable mechanistic and vaccination studies in mice, we identified a dominant CD8 T cell SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein epitope. Infection of human ACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 elicited robust responses to H2-Db/N219-227, and 40% of HLA-A*02+ COVID-19 PBMC samples isolated from hospitalized patients responded to this peptide in culture. In mice, i.m. prime-boost nucleoprotein vaccination with heterologous vectors favored systemic CD8 T cell responses, whereas intranasal boosting favored respiratory immunity. In contrast, a single i.v. immunization with recombinant adenovirus established robust CD8 T cell memory both systemically and in the respiratory mucosa.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as lockdown and mass testing, remain as the mainstay of control measures for the outbreak. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of mass testing, lockdown, or a combination of both to control COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search on 11 major databases was conducted on June 8, 2020. This review is registered in Prospero (CRD420201 90546). We included primary studies written in English which investigate mass screening, lockdown, or a combination of both to control and/or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. There are four important outcomes as selected by WHO experts for their decision- making process: incident cases, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. Among 623 studies, only 14 studies met our criteria. Four observational studies were rated as strong evidence and ten modelling studies were rated as moderate evidence. Based on one modelling study, mass testing reduced the total infected people compared to no mass testing. For lockdown, ten studies consistently showed that it successfully reduced the incidence, onward transmission, and mortality rate of COVID-19. A limited evidence showed that a combination of lockdown and mass screening resulted in a greater reduction of incidence and mortality rate compared to lockdown only. However, there is not enough evidence on the effectiveness of mass testing only.

AB  - Compensatory dose calculations to mitigate the deleterious effect of unscheduled treatment interruptions remain important. They may be increasingly required during and after epidemics, as with the present Covid-19 virus. The information presented to those involved in the actual dose estimations is often limited, thereby increasing the likelihood of confusion, further time delays and possibly incorrect decisions. This article sets out what aspects need to be considered by the Clinical Oncologist (or Radiation Oncologist), and the reasons why, in order to provide greater clarity. The key issues are: (a) the biological nature of the tumour (and hence its repopulation potential), (b) patient age and pre-existing medical risk factors that influence radiation tolerance, the use of chemotherapy, surgery etc, (c) the acceptable dose limits of the relevant normal tissues at risk and (d) consideration of the possibility of further field size adjustments, a change in treatment plan or acceptance of a greater role for alternative forms of radiation treatment (e.g. brachytherapy, electron boosts, etc.) or reliance on radical surgery. Only then can a compensatory schedule be more safely estimated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous strain on healthcare systems worldwide. Understanding of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Pneumonia associated with COVID-19 may lead to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The rise in patients requiring mechanical ventilation may lead to an increase in tracheostomies being performed in patients with COVID-19. Performing tracheostomy in patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection poses a number of challenges. METHODS: These guidelines were written following multidisciplinary agreement between Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Respiratory Medicine and the Department of Anaesthetics and Critical Care Medicine in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. A literature review was performed and a guideline for elective tracheostomy insertion in patients with COVID-19 proposed. CONCLUSION: The decision to perform tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 should be undertaken by senior members of the multidisciplinary team. Steps should be taken to minimise risks to healthcare workers.

AB  - Cancer surveillance is a field focused on collection of data to evaluate the burden of cancer and apply public health strategies to prevent and control cancer in the community. A key challenge facing the cancer surveillance community is the number of manual tasks required to collect cancer surveillance data, thereby resulting in possible delays in analysis and use of the information. To modernize and automate cancer data collection and reporting, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning, developing, and piloting a cancer surveillance cloud-based computing platform (CS-CBCP) with standardized electronic reporting from laboratories and health-care providers. With this system, automation of the cancer case collection process and access to real-time cancer case data can be achieved, which could not be done before. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of continuity of operations plans, and the CS-CBCP has the potential to provide such a platform suitable for remote operations of central cancer registries.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this qualitative systematic review is to identify and synthesize qualitative studies of frontline nurses' experiences and challenges when caring for patients with COVID-19 in hospitals. BACKGROUND: This review is the first qualitative systematic review of nurses' experiences since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Understanding nurses' experiences with COVID-19 is important because nurses are among the most vital of healthcare workers. METHODS: This study used a qualitative systematic review methodology with thematic synthesis to analyse the included studies. Five databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were searched from January to mid-August 2020, and 25 abstracts were screened. Based on inclusion criteria, this qualitative systematic review included nine studies. RESULTS: Five themes were identified as barriers to COVID-19 care by 133 hospital-based nurses: limited information about COVID-19, unpredictable tasks and challenging practices, insufficient support, concerns about family, and emotional and psychological stress. CONCLUSIONS: The five barriers identified in this review should be overcome to improve nurses' experiences and, in turn, the quality of care patients with COVID-19 receive. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The findings from this review can be used to reform current healthcare and hospital-support systems for populations with COVID-19. They can also be used to point towards areas of research interested in improving frontline nursing. Finally, nursing leaders, healthcare policymakers and governments should use these findings to better support the nursing workforce in the current or a future pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review and compare the constellations of causes and consequences of the two current pandemics, Covid-19 and climate change. RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a transient counterbalancing, in which the response to Covid-19 has briefly mitigated pollution and greenhouse gasses. This divergence belies multiple commonalities of cause and effect. SUMMARY: The convergence of these two pandemics is unprecedented. Although at first glance, they appear to be completely unrelated, they share striking commonalities. Both are caused by human behaviors, and some of those behaviors contribute to both pandemics at the same time. Both illustrate the fact that isolation is not an option; these are global issues that inescapably affect all persons and all nations. Both incur prodigious current and anticipated costs. Both have similar societal impacts, and disproportionately harm those with lesser resources, widening the gap between the 'haves and the have-nots.' One can only hope that the devastation caused by these unprecedented pandemics will lead to increased awareness of how human beings have helped to create them and how our responses can and will shape our future.

Nowadays, there are more than a thousand registered clinical trials related to MSC application around the world, highlighting MSC role on difficult-to-treat high-incidence diseases such as the current COVID-19, HIV infections, and autoimmune and metabolic diseases. Here, we summarize a general overview of MSCs and their therapeutic mechanisms; also, we discuss some of the novel clinical trial protocols and their results as well as a comparison between the number of registries, countries, and search portals.

AB  - Vaccination yields the direct individual benefit of protecting recipients from infectious diseases and also the indirect social benefit of reducing the transmission of infections to others, often referred to as herd immunity This research examines how prosocial concern for vaccination, defined as people's preoccupation with infecting others if they do not vaccinate themselves, motivates vaccination in more and less populated regions of the United States. A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.

AB  - The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary focus of most vaccine design and development efforts. Due to intrinsic instability typical of class I fusion proteins, S tends to prematurely refold to the post-fusion conformation, compromising immunogenic properties and prefusion trimer yields. To support ongoing vaccine development efforts, we report the structure-based design of soluble S trimers with increased yields and stabilities, based on introduction of single point mutations and disulfide-bridges. We identify regions critical for stability: the heptad repeat region 1, the SD1 domain and position 614 in SD2. We combine a minimal selection of mostly interprotomeric mutations to create a stable S-closed variant with a 6.4-fold higher expression than the parental construct while no longer containing a heterologous trimerization domain. The cryo-EM structure reveals a correctly folded, predominantly closed pre-fusion conformation. Highly stable and well producing S protein and the increased understanding of S protein structure will support vaccine development and serological diagnostics.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the WHO. This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.

AB  - Although Miller Fisher syndrome cases have been published in this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, anti-GQ1b antibody has not been identified so far. A direct proof of association is not yet available since the exact pathophysiology is not known. Using a proof of contradiction argument, lack of GQ1b serves as the indirect proof that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is probably the infection preceding demyelination. A novel antigen has yet to be described.

AB  - Otorhinolaryngologists, particularly dealing with airway cases, are subjected to highest risk of COVID 19 aerosolisation, self infection and transmission. Moreover, airway cases, which mostly present as emergency, cannot be deferred. Being a tertiary airway centre and having received a number of airway cases, most of them requiring prompt surgical intervention, our airway surgery and anaesthesiology team had to work in conjunction to adapt and readapt the practice over the past few months, striving to achieve effective airway surgery protocols, to minimize exposure and prevent transmission of COVID 19. To enlist the encountered airway cases during COVID 19 pandemic and to highlight the important inclusions and adaptations in executing the airway surgeries. A retrospective observational study of 7 months duration was carried out. This is a single institutional study, where the sample included the primary as well the referred airway cases. Apart from Tracheotomy, Foreign body bronchus removal, Dilatation of Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS) and excision of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), we also have had the experience to deal with congenital Laryngo-tracheo-oesophageal Cleft (LTOC) Type III b, Thyroid surgery to relieve tracheal compression and Bilateral Choanal Atresia repair during the last 7 months. Routine 2 weeks follow up of the patients have been favourable, as there has not been any report or clinical features of transmission of COVID 19. As the airway surgeries could be executed with the incorporation of certain change in practice and as the follow up revealed no evidence of transmission, we attempt to contribute to airway best practice guideline for maintaining the safety of patients and health professionals.

AB  - This commentary describes the transition to remote delivery of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who participates in a clinical trial during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 on children's anxiety and on the family functioning are discussed. Modifications to CBT necessitated by telehealth delivery were aimed at maximizing engagement of children and their parents while maintaining treatment fidelity and adhering to the research protocol. Treatment targets were updated to address new sources of anxiety and CBT exposure exercises were modified to accommodate the new reality of quarantine restrictions. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect treatment delivery it may require a widespread utilization of telehealth for treating anxiety in children with ASD.

AB  - In the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) era, point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) has attracted increased attention. Prospective studies on LUS for the assessment of pneumonia in adult patients were extensively carried out for more than 10 years before this era. None of these prospective studies attempted to differentiate bacterial and viral pneumonia in adult patients using LUS. The majority of studies considered the LUS examination to be positive if sonographic consolidations or multiple B-lines were observed. Significant differences existed in the accuracy of these studies. Some studies revealed that LUS showed superior sensitivity to chest X-ray. These results indicate that point-of-care LUS has the potential to be an initial imaging modality for the diagnosis of pneumonia. The LUS diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units is more challenging in comparison with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in emergency departments due to the limited access to the mechanically ventilated patients and the high prevalence of atelectasis. However, several studies have demonstrated that the combination of LUS findings with other clinical markers improved the diagnostic accuracy. In the COVID-19 era, many case reports and small observational studies on COVID-19 pneumonia have been published in a short period. Multiple B-lines were the most common and consistent finding in COVID-19 pneumonia. Serial LUS showed the deterioration of the disease. The knowledge and ideas on the application of LUS in the management of pneumonia that are expected to accumulate in the COVID-19 era may provide us with clues regarding more appropriate management.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been characterized by lymphopenia as well as a proinflammatory cytokine storm, which are responsible for the poor prognosis and multiorgan defects. The transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) modulates the functions of the immune cells and alters the gene expression profile of different cytokines in response to various pathogenic stimuli, while many proinflammatory factors have been known to induce NF-κB signalling cascade. Besides, NF-κB has been known to potentiate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to apoptosis in various tissues in many diseases and viral infections. Though the reports on the involvement of the NF-κB signalling pathway in COVID-19 are limited, the therapeutic benefits of NF-κB inhibitors including dexamethasone, a synthetic form of glucocorticoid, have increasingly been realized. Considering the fact, the abnormal activation of the NF-κB resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might be associated with the pathogenic profile of immune cells, cytokine storm and multiorgan defects. Thus, the pharmacological inactivation of the NF-κB signalling pathway can strongly represent a potential therapeutic target to treat the symptomatology of COVID-19. This article signifies pharmacological blockade of the phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKKβ), a key downstream effector of NF-κB signalling, for a therapeutic consideration to attenuate COVID-19.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused a worldwide pandemic. Our aim in this study is to produce new fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, which can be the basis for developing new antiviral drugs. The fusion core comprising the heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) were used to design the peptides. A total of twelve peptides were generated, comprising a short or truncated 24-mer (peptide #1), a long 36-mer peptide (peptide #2), and ten peptide #2 analogs. In contrast to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion cannot be inhibited with a minimal length, 24-mer peptide. Peptide #2 demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion at 1 µM concentration. Three peptide #2 analogs showed IC50 values in the low micromolar range (4.7-9.8 µM). Peptide #2 inhibited the SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus assay at IC50=1.49 µM. Given their potent inhibition of viral activity and safety and lack of cytotoxicity, these peptides provide an attractive avenue for the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Korean nurses experienced the effects of the pandemic earlier than in most other countries, and the work of our nurses has been recognized as a successful model in responding COVID-19. In this paper, we share the experiences of Korean nurses, including their experiences of workload, acute shortages of staff and equipment and work overload, and suggest ongoing tasks that need to be addressed to combat the pandemic's second wave and other possible waves. Specifically, the nursing issues relating to COVID-19 are critically reviewed and recommendations for each issue are suggested in terms of nursing staffing, practice and policy, as well as health policy.

AB  - At the outset of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, New York City faced the highest burden of COVID-19 cases in the United States. In response, the U.S. Federal Government deployed medical providers from various uniformed services to treat patients with COVID-19 at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York City. There quickly arose a need for psychiatric services for patients with COVID-19 and psychological support for medical staff. Psychiatrists were tasked with establishing a consult-liaison psychiatry service in this unique environment. The authors detail the establishment of a novel consultation-liaison psychiatry service in a large convention center and explore lessons learned from this experience with the aim to empower uniformed psychiatrists to prepare for and deliver patient-focused care in pandemic settings.

AB  - As I begin my 4th year of medical school amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telehealth has allowed me to connect with many patients who previously struggled to access consistent primary care. In this essay, I describe 2 of my most formative experiences with telehealth: participating in my medical school's new "tele-hotspotting" elective, and providing virtual gender-affirming care through our student-run free clinic. These experiences demonstrate not only telehealth's utility during a viral pandemic, but also its potential as a powerful tool for expanding access to care and promoting health equity over the coming years. With this said, telehealth is not without limitations. Patients and clinicians alike have expressed concerns regarding the challenge of performing a physical exam and maintaining emotional connection across physical distance. A sustained expansion of telehealth is further challenged by inconsistent availability of broadband Internet, as well as a lack of standardized reimbursement procedures for telehealth visits. Strategies are available to help meet these challenges while maximizing health equity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an abrupt change in routines and livelihoods all around the world. This public health crisis amplified a number of systemic inequalities that led to populations needing to grapple with universally difficult truths. Yet some individuals, firms, and countries displayed resilient and creative responses in coping with pressing demands on healthcare and basic sanity. Past work has suggested that engaging in creative acts can be an adaptive response to a changing environment. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to describe how entities at the personal, community, and national levels cultivated and expressed creativity in an effort to make meaning during COVID-19. By overlaying the Four C model of creativity on such responses, we aim to (a) to connect mini, little, Pro, and Big creative behaviors with our attempts to make meaning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) to suggest how engaging in creative expression can be used to guard against the adverse consequences of this outbreak. Acknowledging that this time has been and continues to be distressing and filled with uncertainty, we propose some ways of making sense of current events by applying original thinking across domains. Further, we propose how engaging in creativity can serve to buffer against the negative effects of living through the pandemic.

AB  - COVID-19 presentation is very heterogeneous across cases, and host factors are at the forefront for the variables affecting the disease manifestation. The immune system has emerged as a key determinant in shaping the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is mainly the deleterious unconstrained immune response, rather than the virus itself, which leads to severe cases of COVID-19 and the associated mortality. Genetic susceptibility to dysregulated immune response is highly likely to be among the host factors for adverse disease outcome. Given that such genetic susceptibility has also been observed in autoimmune diseases (ADs), a number of critical questions remain unanswered; whether individuals with ADs have a significantly different risk for COVID-19-related complications compared to the general population, and whether studies on the genetics of ADs can shed some light on the host factors in COVID-19. In this perspective, we discuss the host genetic factors, which have been under investigation in association with COVID-19 severity. We touch upon the intricate link between autoimmunity and COVID-19 pathophysiology. We put forth a number of autoimmune susceptibility genes, which have the potential to be additional host genetic factors for modifying the severity of COVID-19 presentation. In summary, host genetics at the intersection of ADs and COVID-19 may serve as a source for understanding the heterogeneity of COVID-19 severity, and hence, potentially holds a key in achieving effective strategies in risk group identification, as well as effective treatments.

AB  - Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection have emerged globally, findings related to ocular involvement and reported cases are quite limited. Immune reactions against viral infections are closely related to viral and host proteins sequence similarity. Molecular Mimicry has been described for many different viruses; sequence similarities of viral and human tissue proteins may trigger autoimmune reactions after viral infections due to similarities between viral and human structures. With this study, we aimed to investigate the protein sequence similarity of SARS CoV-2 with retinal proteins and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) surface proteins. Retinal proteins involved in autoimmune retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelium surface transport proteins were analyzed in order to infer their structural similarity to surface glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), ORF1ab polyprotein (orf1ab) proteins of SARS CoV-2. Protein similarity comparisons, 3D protein structure prediction, T cell epitopes-MHC binding prediction, B cell epitopes-MHC binding prediction and the evaluation of the antigenicity of peptides assessments were performed. The protein sequence analysis was made using the Pairwise Sequence Alignment and the LALIGN program. 3D protein structure estimates were made using Swiss Model with default settings and analyzed with TM-align web server. T-cell epitope identification was performed using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis (IEDB) resource Tepitool. B cell epitopes based on sequence characteristics of the antigen was performed using amino acid scales and HMMs with the BepiPred 2.0 web server. The predicted peptides/epitopes in terms of antigenicity were examined using the default settings with the VaxiJen v2.0 server. Analyses showed that, there is a meaningful similarities between 6 retinal pigment epithelium surface transport proteins (MRP-4, MRP-5, RFC1, SNAT7, TAUT and MATE) and the SARS CoV-2 E protein. Immunoreactive epitopic sites of these proteins which are similar to protein E epitope can create an immune stimulation on T cytotoxic and T helper cells and 6 of these 9 epitopic sites are also vaxiJen. These result imply that autoimmune cross-reaction is likely between the studied RPE proteins and SARS CoV-2 E protein. The structure of SARS CoV-2, its proteins and immunologic reactions against these proteins remain largely unknown. Understanding the structure of SARS CoV-2 proteins and demonstration of similarity with human proteins are crucial to predict an autoimmune response associated with immunity against host proteins and its clinical manifestations as well as possible adverse effects of vaccination.

AB  - Past research studies have acknowledged the role of resilience in policies and decisions to address disruptive events and proposed frameworks to measure it. The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.

AB  - In Turkey, spas are widely used and preferred by patients who are seeking relief from their disability and pain. The spa therapy program is partly reimbursed by the national health insurance system. The objective of the present study was to leverage Google Trends to elucidate the public interest in spas in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Google Trends was queried to analyze search trends within Turkey for the Turkish term representing a spa (i.e., kaplıca) from January 01, 2016, to September 30, 2020. The relative search volume of "kaplıca" was statistically significantly decreased in the March 15-May 30, 2020 (- 73.04%; p < 0.001); May 31-July 25, 2020 (- 41.38%; p < 0.001); and July 26-September 19, 2020 (- 29.98%; p < 0.001) periods compared to similar periods of preceding 4 years (2016-2019). After June 1, 2020, the relative search volume was shown to have a moderate recovery, without reaching the level of 2016-2019. Public interest in spas showed an initial sharp decline between mid-March and May, with a moderate increase during the June-August period. This finding might be indicative of public preference in undertaking spa therapy during the COVID-19 period. In Turkey, spas might be used to increase places providing rehabilitation for both non-COVID-19 patients and survivors of COVID-19 with long-term symptoms during the pandemic.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped RNA viruses and have been shown to cause mild to severe respiratory infections in humans, with some severe cases inducing neurological manifestations. The lethality and Neurological effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and recently the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been well documented though currently there is little literature regarding long term effects and the implications for neurorehabilitation. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV have been linked to the infection associated inflammatory cytokine storms and induced hypercoagulopathic states that affect the entire vascular system including that of the brain. This mini-review provides an overview of the commonalities among studies published on all three types of the coronavirus related to acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The aim was to elucidate the physiological mechanisms underpinning COVID-2 and to reflect the similarities with the chronic inflammation induced symptoms of AIS that are likely to prove a further challenge for neurorehabilitation clinicians post COVID. In terms of increased incidence of COVID and AIS, it is likely that in depth knowledge of increased thrombotic risk in this population will require appropriate anticoagulation treatment, and other therapeutic interventions as well as neurorehabilitation interventions. Lastly the risk of spreading the virus requires further balancing of the provision of neurorehabiliatation services useful to the patient.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The rapid spread of the virus worldwide prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. COVID-19 discontinuing's a global health crisis. Approximately 80% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 display undetectable to mild inflammation confined in the upper respiratory tract. In remaining patients, the disease turns into a severe form affecting almost all major organs predominantly due to an imbalance of innate and adaptive arms of host immunity. The purpose of the present review is to narrate the virus's invasion through the system and the host's reaction. A thorough discussion on disease severity is also presented regarding the behavior of the host's immune system, which gives rise to the cytokine storm particularly in elderly patients and those with comorbidities. A multifaceted yet concise description of molecular aspects of disease progression and its repercussion on biochemical and immunological features in infected patients is tabulated. The summary of pathological, clinical, immunological, and molecular accounts discussed in this review is of theranostic importance to clinicians for early diagnosis of COVID-19 and its management.

AB  - The global outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted a requirement for two pronged clinical interventions such as development of effective vaccines and acute therapeutic options for medium-to-severe stages of "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19). Effective vaccines, if successfully developed, have been emphasized to become the most effective strategy in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Basic research advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering have already provided excellent progress and groundbreaking new discoveries in the field of the coronavirus biology and its epidemiology. In particular, for the vaccine development the advances in characterization of a capsid structure and identification of its antigens that can become targets for new vaccines. The development of the experimental vaccines requires a plethora of molecular techniques as well as strict compliance with safety procedures. The research and clinical data integrity, cross-validation of the results, and appropriated studies from the perspective of efficacy and potently side effects have recently become a hotly discussed topic. In this review, we present an update on latest advances and progress in an ongoing race to develop 52 different vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis is focused on registered clinical trials (current as of November 04, 2020) that fulfill the international safety and efficacy criteria in the vaccine development. The requirements as well as benefits and risks of diverse types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are discussed including those containing whole-virus and live-attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, mRNA vaccines, DNA vaccines, live vector vaccines, and also plant-based vaccine formulation containing coronavirus-like particle (VLP). The challenges associated with the vaccine development as well as its distribution, safety and long-term effectiveness have also been highlighted and discussed.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has become a major challenge for health care professionals and researchers all over the world. The discovery and development of new drugs require time for passing the quality, safety, and efficacy criteria. Hence the only available option is to rely on herbal or natural remedies as well as other existing ones. Nature has its healing power and has the remedy for all the ailments from which life on earth is struggling. For this pandemic situation also, nature should have created a remedy but finding a loophole is in the hands of our researchers. In this hypothesis, a novel combination strategy is introduced with the existing drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and flavonoid in a volatile liquid-based Nanoformulation incorporated into an inhaler as a possible remedy for the management of coronavirus infection. The synergistic activity of this combination shall pave the way for an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID- 19 symptoms.

AB  - Samples of groundwater were collected during a post-monsoon period (January) and a pre-monsoon period (May) in 2020 from 30 locations in the rapidly developing industrial and residential area of the Coimbatore region in southern India. These sampling periods coincided with times before and during the lockdown in industrial activity and reduced agricultural activity that occurred in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of reduced anthropogenic activity on groundwater quality. Approximately 17% of the wells affected by high fluoride concentrations in the post-monsoon period returned to levels suitable for human consumption in samples collected in the pre-monsoon period. This was probably due to ion exchange processes, infiltration of rainwater during the seasonal monsoon that diluted concentrations of ions including geogenic fluoride, as well as a reduction in anthropogenic inputs during the lockdown. The total hazard index for fluoride in the post-monsoon samples calculated for children, adult women, and adult men indicated that 73%, 60%, and 50% of the groundwater samples, respectively, had fluoride levels higher than the permissible limit. In this study, nitrate pollution declined by 33.4% by the pre-monsoon period relative to the post-monsoon period. The chemical facies of groundwater reverted from the Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Cl to the Ca-HCO3 type in pre-monsoon samples. Various geogenic indicators like molar ratios, inter-ionic relations along with graphical tools demonstrated that plagioclase mineral weathering, carbonate dissolution, reverse ion exchange, and anthropogenic inputs are influencing the groundwater chemistry of this region. These findings were further supported by the saturation index assessed for the post- and pre-monsoon samples. COVID-19 lockdown considerably reduced groundwater pollution by Na+, K+, Cl-, NO3¯, and F- ions due to shutdown of industries and reduced agricultural activities. Further groundwater quality improvement during lockdown period there is evidence that the COVID-19 lockdown by increased HCO3¯ ion concentration. Overall results illustrate the positive benefits to groundwater quality that could occur as a result of measures to control anthropogenic inputs of pollutants.

AB  - The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections that causes coronavirus-induced disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is the defining and unprecedented global health crisis of our time in both the scale and magnitude. Although the respiratory tract is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, accumulating evidence suggests that the virus may also invade both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) leading to numerous neurological issues including some serious complications such as seizures, encephalitis, and loss of consciousness. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the currently known role of SARS-CoV-2 and identify all the neurological problems reported among the COVID-19 case reports throughout the world. The virus might gain entry into the CNS either through the trans-synaptic route via the olfactory neurons or through the damaged endothelium in the brain microvasculature using the ACE2 receptor potentiated by neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). The most critical of all symptoms appear to be the spontaneous loss of breathing in some COVID-19 patients. This might be indicative of a dysfunction within the cardiopulmonary regulatory centers in the brainstem. These pioneering studies, thus, lay a strong foundation for more in-depth basic and clinical research required to confirm the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neurodegeneration of critical brain regulatory centers.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected millions of individuals and has claimed hundreds of thousands of human lives worldwide. Patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 patients have high incidence of cardiovascular complications such as acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, and thromboembolism. The disease has no approved proven effective therapy and hence repurposing of existing approved drugs has been considered as the fastest treatment approach. Statins have been shown to exhibit lipid lowering dependent and independent cardiovascular protective effects as well as favorable effects in various other pathophysiological states. These beneficial properties of statins are a result of their multiple pleotropic effects that include, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic and antimicrobial properties. In this review, we provide a comprehensive description of the mechanisms of the pleotropic effects of statins, the relevant pre-clinical and clinical data pertinent to their role in infections and acute lung injury, the possible cardiovascular benefits of statins in COVID-19, and the implications of the therapeutic potential of statins in COVID-19 disease. We conclude with the rationale for conducting randomized controlled trials of statins in COVID-19 disease.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings is concerning, with healthcare workers representing a disproportionately high percentage of confirmed cases. Although SARS-CoV-2 virus has been found to persist on surfaces for a number of days, the extent and duration of fomites as a mode of transmission, particularly in healthcare settings, has not been fully characterized. To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID50 assay within 24 h. These findings underline the importance of appropriate handling of contaminated PPE during and following use in high-risk settings and provide interesting insight into the potential utility of cotton in limiting COVID-19 transmission.

Several challenges were experienced by trainees and programs alike due to the economic repercussions of the pandemic, how social distancing affected the delivery of medical education, testing and interviewing, how the surge of patients affected redeployment of personnel, potential compromise in core training and the overall impact on the wellness and mental health of trainees and educators. The ability of medical teams and researchers to peer review, conduct clinical research and keep up with literature was similarly challenged by the rapid growth in peer-review and pre-print literature. We review these challenges and share strategies that institutions, educators and learners adopted, adapted and developed to provide quality education during these unprecedented times.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 cases are on surge; however, there is no efficient treatment or vaccine that can be used for its management. Numerous clinical trials are being reviewed for use of different drugs, biologics, and vaccines in COVID-19. A much empirical approach will be to repurpose existing drugs for which pharmacokinetic and safety data are available, because this will facilitate the process of drug development. The article discusses the evidence available for the use of Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug with antiviral properties, in COVID-19. METHODS: A rational review of the drugs was carried out utilizing their clinically significant attributes. A more thorough understanding was met by virtual embodiment of the drug structure and realizable viral targets using artificial intelligence (AI)-based and molecular dynamics (MD)-simulation-based study. CONCLUSION: Certain studies have highlighted the significance of ivermectin in COVID-19; however, it requires evidences from more Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and dose- response studies to support its use. In silico-based analysis of ivermectin's molecular interaction specificity using AI and classical mechanics simulation-based methods indicates positive interaction of ivermectin with viral protein targets, which is leading for SARS-CoV 2 N-protein NTD (nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain).

AB  - Coronavirus was first discovered during the year 1930 and since then vrious coronaviruses like HKU1, MERS-CoV , NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 had been found to infect humans. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is spreading at an alarming rate thereby created health emergency around the world. SARS-CoV2 is reportedly to be originated from wet animal market of Wuhan, China. Since then the world is searching for effective way to manage and treat the COVID-19 infection. The infections has already multiplied with several folds compared to the number of person infected by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. In order to fill the gap of knowledge about this virus, several evidences are required to control it so more lives could be saved. The present review is based on the publicly available literature in order to explore the knowledge regarding epidemiology, virology, diagnosis, clinical features, pharmacological and therapeutic ways to treat the novel coronavirus. This can be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutics in fighting this disease.

AB  - Objective: The low observed prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in certain cohorts has led to a hypothesis regarding nicotine's therapeutic role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As new scientific evidence surfaces, premature conclusions about nicotine are rife in social media, especially unwarranted leaps of such associations to vaping and smoking. This study reports on the prevalence of such leaps and the nature of authors who are making them. Methods: We used a Twitter API subscription service to download tweets (n = 17,533) that match terms indicating nicotine or vaping themes, in addition to those that point to a prophylactic or therapeutic effect and COVID-19 (January-July 2020). Using a windowing approach, we focused on tweets that are more likely to convey the therapeutic intent. We hand-annotated these filtered tweets and built a classifier that identifies tweets that extrapolate a nicotine link to vaping/smoking. We analyzed the frequently used terms in author bios, top Web links, and hashtags of such tweets. Results: 21% of our filtered tweets indicate a vaping/smoking-based prevention/treatment narrative. Our classifier was able to spot tweets that make unproven claims about vaping/smoking and COVID-19 with a positive predictive value of 85%. Qualitative analyses show a variety of ways therapeutic claims are being made and user bios reveal pre-existing notions of positive stances toward vaping. Conclusion: The social media landscape is a double-edged sword in tobacco communication. Although it increases information reach, consumers can also be subject to confirmation bias when exposed to inadvertent or deliberate framing of scientific discourse that may border on misinformation. This calls for circumspection and additional planning in countering such narratives as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our world.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is seriously threatening public health and setting off huge economic crises across the world. In the absence of specific drugs for COVID-19, there is an urgent need to look for alternative approaches. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to review the roles of micronutrients and bioactive substances as potential alternative approaches in combating COVID-19. METHODS: This review was based on the literature identified using electronic searches in different databases. RESULTS: Vitamins (A, B, C, D, and E), minerals (selenium and zinc), and bioactive substances from curcumin, echinacea, propolis, garlic, soybean, green tea, and other polyphenols were identified as having potential roles in interfering with spike glycoproteins, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and transmembrane protease serine 2 at the entry site, and inhibiting activities of papain-like protease, 3 chymotrypsin-like protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Having immunomodulating, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral properties, such micronutrients and bioactive substances are consequently promising alterative nutritional approaches to combat COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The roles of micronutrients and bioactive substances in the fight against COVID-19 are exciting areas of research. This review may suggest directions for further study.

AB  - As the global response to COVID-19 continues, nurses will be tasked with appropriately triaging patients, responding to events of clinical deterioration, and developing family-centered plans of care within a healthcare system exceeding capacity. Predictive analytics monitoring, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool that translates streaming clinical data into a real-time visual estimation of patient risks, allows for evolving acuity assessments and detection of clinical deterioration while the patient is in pre-symptomatic states. While nurses are on the frontline for the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of AI-based predictive analytics monitoring may help cognitively complex clinical decision-making tasks and pave a pathway for early detection of patients at risk for decompensation. We must develop strategies and techniques to study the impact of AI-based technologies on patient care outcomes and the clinical workflow. This paper outlines key concepts for the intersection of nursing and precision predictive analytics monitoring.

AB  - Human population growth, climate change, and globalization are accelerating the emergence of novel pathogenic viruses. In the past two decades alone, three such members of the coronavirus family have posed serious threats, spurring intense efforts to understand their biology as a way to identify targetable vulnerabilities. Coronaviruses use a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) mechanism to direct synthesis of their replicase proteins. This is a critical switch in their replication program that can be therapeutically targeted. Here, we discuss how nearly half a century of research into -1 PRF have provided insight into the virological importance of -1 PRF, the molecular mechanisms that drive it, and approaches that can be used to manipulate it towards therapeutic outcomes with particular emphasis on SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is critical for virus infection via engagement of ACE2, and amino acid variation in Spike is increasingly appreciated. Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. Here we report fatal SARS-CoV-2 escape from neutralising antibodies in an immune suppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, generating whole genome ultradeep sequences by both short and long read technologies over 23 time points spanning 101 days. Little evolutionary change was observed in the viral population over the first 65 days despite two courses of remdesivir. However, following convalescent plasma we observed dynamic virus population shifts, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain bearing D796H in S2 and deltaH69/deltaV70 in the S1 NTD of the Spike protein. As serum neutralisation waned, viruses with the escape genotype diminished in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma. In vitro, the Spike escape variant conferred decreased sensitivity to multiple units of convalescent plasma/sera from different recovered patients, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. These data reveal strong positive selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy and identify the combination of Spike mutations D796H and deltaH69/deltaV70 as a broad antibody resistance mechanism against commonly occurring antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementRKG is supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in Clinical Science (WT108082AIA).

AB  - Multiple national and international trends and drivers are radically changing what biological security means for the United Kingdom (UK). New technologies present novel opportunities and challenges, and globalisation has created new pathways and increased the speed, volume and routes by which organisms can spread. The UK Biological Security Strategy (2018) acknowledges the importance of research on biological security in the UK. Given the breadth of potential research, a targeted agenda identifying the questions most critical to effective and coordinated progress in different disciplines of biological security is required. We used expert elicitation to generate 80 policy-relevant research questions considered by participants to have the greatest impact on UK biological security. Drawing on a collaboratively-developed set of 450 questions, proposed by 41 experts from academia, industry and the UK government (consulting 168 additional experts) we subdivided the final 80 questions into six categories: bioengineering; communication and behaviour; disease threats (including pandemics); governance and policy; invasive alien species; and securing biological materials and securing against misuse. Initially, the questions were ranked through a voting process and then reduced and refined to 80 during a one-day workshop with 35 participants from a variety of disciplines. Consistently emerging themes included: the nature of current and potential biological security threats, the efficacy of existing management actions, and the most appropriate future options. The resulting questions offer a research agenda for biological security in the UK that can assist the targeting of research resources and inform the implementation of the UK Biological Security Strategy. These questions include research that could aid with the mitigation of Covid-19, and preparation for the next pandemic. We hope that our structured and rigorous approach to creating a biological security research agenda will be replicated in other countries and regions. The world, not just the UK, is in need of a thoughtful approach to directing biological security research to tackle the emerging issues.

AB  - Background: In a resource-demanding COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines can free up health care resources needed for providing better care to those with COVID-19 and other patients. This study was performed to design a guideline to manage patients with colorectal cancers during the COVID-19pandemic. Methods: To design this guideline, major topics and headings of colon and rectal cancers (CRC) were selected and included. Based on the extent of COVID-19 infection in the community and availability of hospital resources, the guideline has been designed for 2 major COVID-19 phases. Several multidisciplinary discussion sessions were held to review the comments of experts, finalize the data, and write the guideline. Results: This guideline has been prepared in 2 main COVID-19 phases of the community/hospital. Phase A refers to the condition where a large number of COVID-19 patients are admitted to the hospital, but limited surgical ICU beds and facilities are still accessible. In phase B, many people are affected by COVID-19, and all hospital resources are allocated for COVID 19 patients. In phase A, 4 major groups are discussed, including malignant and suspicious colorectal polyps, colon cancers, rectal cancers, and recurrent cancers. The approach to emergent cases, including obstruction, bleeding, and perforation, will be presented in phase B. Conclusion: This guideline is a comprehensive instruction on the approach to colorectal cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic that covers the major topics of colon and rectal cancers in detail.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The measurement of vital signs is an important part of clinical work up. Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear. METHODS: A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the "fifth vital sign" for any hospitalized patient.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 38 million people world-wide by person to person transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therapeutic and preventative strategies for SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant challenge. Within the past several months, effective treatment options have emerged and now include repurposed antivirals, corticosteroids and virus-specific antibodies. The latter has included convalescence plasma and monoclonal antibodies. Complete viral eradication will be achieved through an effective, safe and preventative vaccine. To now provide a comprehensive summary for each of the pharmacotherapeutics and preventative strategies being offered or soon to be developed for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Humans have witnessed three deadly pandemics so far in the twenty-first century which are associated with novel coronaviruses: SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19. All of these viruses, which are responsible for causing acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), are highly contagious in nature and/or have caused high mortalities. The recently emerged COVID-19 disease is a highly transmittable viral infection caused by another zoonotic novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to the other two coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also likely to have originated from bats, which have been serving as established reservoirs for various pathogenic coronaviruses. Although, it is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from bats to humans, the rapid human-to-human transmission has been confirmed widely. The disease first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread across the globe, infected 48,539,872 people, and caused 1,232,791 deaths in 215 countries, and the infection is still spreading at the time of manuscript preparation. So far, there is no definite line of treatment which has been approved or vaccine which is available. However, different types of potential vaccines and therapeutics have been evaluated and/or are under clinical trials against COVID-19. In this review, we summarize different types of acute respiratory diseases and briefly discuss earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses and compare their occurrence and pathogenicity with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Various epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 such as mode of spread, death rate, doubling time, etc., have been discussed in detail. Apart from this, different technical issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic including use of masks and other socio-economic problems associated with the pandemic have also been summarized. Additionally, we have reviewed various aspects of patient management strategies including mechanism of action, available diagnostic tools, etc., and also discussed different strategies for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to deal with this viral outbreak. Overall, by the inclusion of various references, this review covers, in detail, the most important aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started as an outbreak in China and soon crossed borders to affect the populations in all countries of the world. During the initial course of the disease, COVID-19 was perceived as a pneumonia-like illness. However, recent findings of COVID-19 patients suggest that the virus has the potential to disseminate to different tissues and organs, and cause significant complications. SUMMARY: Neurological symptoms are of great significance as these usually present in and complicate critical cases. Many case reports and case series have documented the findings of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. From the existing data, the most frequent symptoms in these patients were broadly classified into the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system, and skeletal muscular symptoms. CNS symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, cerebrovascular complications, peripheral nervous system symptoms include anosmia, ageusia, and skeletal muscular symptoms include myalgias. It is postulated that the cause may be direct CNS injury through blood and neuronal pathways or indirectly because of an immune-mediated response, hypoxia caused by decreased oxygen saturation, or by the binding of subacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors. Striking radiologic findings in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms have also emerged. CONCLUSIONS: As subacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 may potentially have lethal implications on the nervous system, it is important that neurologists are better informed about the spectrum of clinical manifestations, radiologic findings, and likely mechanisms of injury. Understanding the symptoms and radiologic imaging allows clinicians to consider brain imaging in any patient with suspected COVID-19 and neurological symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Secondary care ENT Centre. METHODS: All patients attending the hospital for office ENT consultations from 15th April 2020 to 15th September 2020 were included in the study. A total of 6692 office patients were evaluated for feasibility, usability and tolerability of the 0.5% PVP-I gargles and nasal drops. RESULTS: Overall practicability of using 0.5% PVP-I gargles and nasal drops at office level was assessed in terms of feasibility and usability. Feasibility and usability was considered in terms of the ease of the dispensing method of the 0.5% PVP-I gargles and nasal drops by the health care workers to the patients prior to ENT examination. Tolerance was assessed in terms of altered taste, staining of teeth or nasal skin or irritation in the nose. None reported any serious reactions or adverse effects following use of 0.5% PVP-I. CONCLUSION: The study reports the successful feasibility and usability of 0.5% PVP-I gargles and nasal drops and bears the potential to provide benefits in preventing transmission from the patients to the health care workers and vice versa. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

AB  - BACKGROUND: When a new or re-emergent pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, causes a major outbreak, rapid access to pertinent research findings is crucial for planning strategies and decision making. We researched whether the speed of sharing research results in the COVID-19 epidemic was higher than the SARS and Ebola epidemics. We also researched whether there is any difference in the most frequent topics investigated before and after the COVID-19, SARS, and Ebola epidemics started. METHODS: We used PubMed database search tools to determine the time-period it took for the number of articles to rise after the epidemics started and the most frequent topics assigned to the articles. RESULTS: The main results were, first, the rise in the number of articles occurred 6 weeks after the COVID-19 epidemic started whereas, this rise occurred 4 months after the SARS and 7 months after the Ebola epidemics started. Second, etiology, statistics & numerical data, and epidemiology were the three most frequent topics investigated in the COVID-19 epidemic. However, etiology, microbiology, and genetics in the SARS epidemic, and statistics & numerical data, epidemiology, and prevention & control in the Ebola epidemic were more frequently studied compared with other topics. Third, some topics were studied more frequently after the epidemics started. CONCLUSIONS: The speed of sharing results in the COVID-19 epidemic was much higher than the SARS and Ebola epidemics, and that there is a difference in the most frequent articles' topics investigated in these three epidemics. Due to the value of time in controlling epidemics spread, the study highlights the necessity of defining more solutions for rapidly providing pertinent research findings in fighting against the next public health emergency.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was announced as a pandemic in March 2020. Different diagnostic laboratory tests have been used to detect the infection. Each diagnostic tool, such as Chest Computed tomography (CT) imaging, genome sequencing, nucleic acid amplification methods, whole genome sequencing, microarray, and serology testing have several advantages and disadvantages. Nucleic acid amplification methods are better diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in early stages of the infection, while serological tests are more appropriate for the recognition of previously infected patients. In this review, we will briefly consider each diagnostic method, and discuss its pros and cons.

AB  - This research attempts to explore the total of 21 potential internal and external shocks to the European market during the Covid-19 Crisis. Using the time series of 1 Jan 2020 to 26 June 2020, I employ a machine learning technique, i.e. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to examine the research question for its benefits over the traditional regression methods. This further allows me to cater to the issue of limited data during the crisis and at the same time, allows both variable selection and regularization in the analysis. Additionally, LASSO is not susceptible to and sensitive to outliers and multi-collinearity. The European market is mostly affected by indices belonging to Singapore, Switzerland, Spain, France, Germany, and the S&P500 index. There is a significant difference in the predictors before and after the pandemic announcement by WHO. Before the Pandemic period announcement by WHO, Europe was hit by the gold market, EUR/USD exchange rate, Dow Jones index, Switzerland, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, and Turkey and after the announcement by WHO, only France and Germany were selected by the lasso approach. It is found that Germany and France are the most predictors in the European market.•A LASSO approach is used to predict the European stock market index during COVID-19•European market is mostly affected by the indices belonging to Singapore, Switzerland, Spain, France, Germany, and the S&P500 index.•There is a significant difference in the predictors before and after the pandemic announcement by WHO.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has a major impact on psychiatry by its social consequences and possible direct effect of certain forms of Covid-19 on mental health. During this crisis, the accessibility of technology meets a state of necessity, which has propelled telepsychiatry from the shadows into the light. The contribution of several technologies (i.e. virtual reality, actigraphy, computational psychiatry) combining clinical data and neuroscience underlines the great neurobehavioural variability even within the same diagnostic category, calling for greater precision in therapeutic offers as suggested e.g. by developments in neurofeedback. The place of intranasal esketamin in the panoply of antidepressent drug treatments for resistant depression has not yet been defined.

AB  - Birmingham University Turnkey laboratory is part of the Lighthouse network responsible for testing clinical samples under the UK government ‘Test &amp; Trace’ scheme. Samples are analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples using the Thermofisher TaqPath RT-QPCR test, which is designed to co-amplify sections of three SARS-CoV-2 viral genes.Since more recent information became available regarding the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (S-VoC), which can show a suboptimal profile in RT-QPCR tests such as the ThermoFisher TaqPath used at the majority of Lighthouse laboratories, we analysed recently published data for trends and significance of the S-gene ‘dropout’ variant.Results showed that:the population of S-gene dropout samples had significantly lower median Ct values of ORF and N-gene targets compared to samples where S-gene was detectedon a population basis, S-gene dropout samples clustered around very low Ct values for ORF and N targetslinked Ct values for individual samples showed that a low Ct for ORF and N were clearly associated with an S-dropout characteristicwhen conservatively inferring relative viral load from Ct values, approximately 35% of S-dropout samples had high viral loads between 10 and 10,000-fold greater than 1 × 106, compared to 10% of S-positive samples.This analysis suggests that patients whose samples exhibit the S-dropout profile in the TaqPath test are more likely to have high viral loads at the time of sampling. The relevance of this to epidemiological reports of fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in regions of the UK is discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe testing work in this project is funded by the UK Department of Health and Social CareAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The use of sample result data in this study was reviewed by the Ethics review committee of the College of Medical and Dental Sciences at the University of Birmingham.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic presents the challenge for medical education to teach practical skills without practical training. To provide an alternative to hands-on training during the COVID-19 lockdown, we created a virtual curriculum to teach practical skills using videos combined with online exams on a virtual e‑learning platform. The goal was to convey different theoretical and practical aspects of urology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The videos were produced by department employees using a predefined concept. The students had access to the virtual curriculum via the university's Moodle e‑learning platform. To assess the success of training, participating students had to pass an online exam about the curriculum's contents, followed by an evaluation of the course. RESULTS: A total of 164 participants took part in the virtual curriculum. The overall evaluation and feedback was very positive. The acceptance of the virtual alternative to hands-on teaching was high. DISCUSSION: The virtual curriculum offered a fast and contactless alternative to the regular hands-on teaching.

AB  - To determine whether the past half-year of COVID-19-related lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and social isolation were associated with changes in high-risk alcohol use, a total of 5,931 individuals completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at one of six time points from April through September 2020. Over the 6-month period, hazardous alcohol use and likely dependence increased month-by-month for those under lockdowns compared to those not under restrictions. This increase in harmful alcohol use and related behaviors is likely to have prolonged adverse psychosocial, interpersonal, occupational, and health impacts as the world attempts to recover from the pandemic crisis.

AB  - The human body is continuously threatened by pathogens, and the immune system must maintain a balance between fighting infection and becoming over-activated. Mucosal surfaces cover several anatomically diverse organs throughout the body, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and are directly exposed to the external environment. Various pathogens invade the body through mucosal surfaces, making the mucosa the frontline of immune defense. The immune systems of various mucosal tissues display distinctive features that reflect the tissues' anatomical and functional characteristics. This review discusses the cellular components that constitute the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; in particular, it highlights the complex interactions between epithelial and immune cells to induce Ag-specific immune responses in the lung and gut. This information on mucosal immunity may facilitate understanding of the defense mechanisms against infectious agents that invade mucosal surfaces, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and provide insight into effective vaccine development.

AB  - mRNA vaccines have evolved from being a mere curiosity to emerging as COVID-19 vaccine front-runners. Recent advancements in the field of RNA technology, vaccinology, and nanotechnology have generated interest in delivering safe and effective mRNA therapeutics. In this review, we discuss design and self-assembly of mRNA vaccines. Self-assembly, a spontaneous organization of individual molecules, allows for design of nanoparticles with customizable properties. We highlight the materials commonly utilized to deliver mRNA, their physicochemical characteristics, and other relevant considerations, such as mRNA optimization, routes of administration, cellular fate, and immune activation, that are important for successful mRNA vaccination. We also examine the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines currently in clinical trials. mRNA vaccines are ready for the clinic, showing tremendous promise in the COVID-19 vaccine race, and have pushed the boundaries of gene therapy.

AB  - Cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been reported in a number of countries. Further, the level of natural immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection is not fully clear, nor is it clear if a primary infection is protective against reinfection. To investigate the potential association between serum antibody titers and reinfection of SARS-CoV-2, ferrets with different levels of NAb titers after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection were subjected to reinfection with a heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strain. All heterologous SARS-CoV-2 reinfected ferrets showed active virus replication in the upper respiratory and gastro-intestinal tracts. However, the high NAb titer group showed attenuated viral replication and rapid viral clearance. In addition, direct-contact transmission was observed only from reinfected ferrets with low NAb titers (< 20), and not from other groups. Further, lung histopathology demonstrated the presence of limited inflammatory regions in the high NAb titer groups compared with control and low NAb groups. This study demonstrates a close correlation between a low NAb titer and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a recovered ferret reinfection model.

AB  - With schools reopening, an increasing number of custodians are applying disinfectant spray methods to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces, including school supplies, walls, desks, and chairs, to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission between students, and teachers and students in the classroom. In this research, we present a novel characterization method to evaluate disinfectant droplet size and coverage for two types of commonly used disinfectant sprayers and suggest the optimum application practice for them.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared a pandemic, has exhibited a wide range of severity worldwide. Although this global variation is largely affected by socio-medical situations in each country, there is also high individual-level variation attributable to elderliness and certain underlying medical conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. As both elderliness and the aforementioned chronic conditions are often associated with an altered gut microbiota, resulting in disrupted gut barrier integrity, and gut symptoms have consistently been associated with more severe illness in COVID-19 patients, it is possible that dysfunction of the gut as a whole influences COVID-19 severity. This article summarizes the accumulating evidence that supports the hypothesis that an altered gut microbiota and its associated leaky gut may contribute to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and occasionally to additional multiorgan complications that may lead to severe illness by allowing leakage of the causative coronavirus into the circulatory system.

AB  - Vaccines and therapeutics are urgently needed for the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we screen human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein via antibody library constructed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a convalescent patient. The CT-P59 mAb potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 isolates including the D614G variant without antibody-dependent enhancement effect. Complex crystal structure of CT-P59 Fab/RBD shows that CT-P59 blocks interaction regions of RBD for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with an orientation that is notably different from previously reported RBD-targeting mAbs. Furthermore, therapeutic effects of CT-P59 are evaluated in three animal models (ferret, hamster, and rhesus monkey), demonstrating a substantial reduction in viral titer along with alleviation of clinical symptoms. Therefore, CT-P59 may be a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.

AB  - Illuminating paraffin (kerosene) is the primary cooking fuel for approximately two million South Africans. The highly flammable and toxic fuel is burnt in poorly made stoves that are prone to malfunction and are associated with accidental fires, burns and household air pollution. However, the fuel continues to be used as it is easily decanted, widely available in neighbourhood outlets, perceived as affordable, and often the only available option for low-income urban settlements. It is anticipated that increased and enforced home congestion during COVID-19 lockdowns will exacerbate exposure of homebound families to unsafe energy, especially during the cold winter months. Based on an accumulation of evidence on the health and socioeconomic impacts of paraffin, this article advocates for its expedited phase-out and substitution with safer energy.

AB  - Viral infections remain a major cause of economic loss with an unmet need for novel therapeutic agents. Ivermectin is a putative antiviral compound; the proposed mechanism is the inhibition of nuclear translocation of viral proteins, facilitated by mammalian host importins, a necessary process for propagation of infections. We systematically reviewed the evidence for the applicability of ivermectin against viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 regarding efficacy, mechanisms and selective toxicity. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was mined to determine potential nuclear location signals for ivermectin and meta-analyses for in vivo studies included all comparators over time, dose range and viral replication in multiple organs. Ivermectin inhibited the replication of many viruses including those in Flaviviridae, Circoviridae and Coronaviridae families in vitro. Real and mock nuclear location signals were identified in SARS-CoV-2, a potential target for ivermectin and predicting a sequestration bait for importin β, stopping infected cells from reaching a virus-resistant state. While pharmacokinetic evaluations indicate that ivermectin could be toxic if applied based on in vitro studies, inhibition of viral replication in vivo was shown for Porcine circovirus in piglets and Suid herpesvirus in mice. Overall standardized mean differences; 95% confidence intervals for ivermectin versus controls were: -4.43 (-5.81, -3.04), P < 0.00001. Based on current results, the potential for repurposing ivermectin as an antiviral agent is promising. However, further work is needed to reconcile in vitro studies with clinical efficacy. Developing ivermectin as an additional antiviral agent should be pursued with an emphasis on pre-clinical trials in validated models of infection.

AB  - To overcome pandemics, such as COVID-19, vaccines are urgently needed at very high volumes. Here we assess the techno-economic feasibility of producing RNA vaccines for the demand associated with a global vaccination campaign. Production process performance is assessed for three messenger RNA (mRNA) and one self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccines, all currently under clinical development, as well as for a hypothetical next-generation saRNA vaccine. The impact of key process design and operation uncertainties on the performance of the production process was assessed. The RNA vaccine drug substance (DS) production rates, volumes and costs are mostly impacted by the RNA amount per vaccine dose and to a lesser extent by the scale and titre in the production process. The resources, production scale and speed required to meet global demand vary substantially in function of the RNA amount per dose. For lower dose saRNA vaccines, global demand can be met using a production process at a scale of below 10 L bioreactor working volume. Consequently, these small-scale processes require a low amount of resources to set up and operate. RNA DS production can be faster than fill-to-finish into multidose vials; hence the latter may constitute a bottleneck.

AB  - The care needs for aging adults are increasing burdens on health systems around the world. Efforts minimizing risk to improve quality of life and aging have proven moderately successful, but acute shocks and chronic stressors to an individual's systemic physical and cognitive functions may accelerate their inevitable degradations. A framework for resilience to the challenges associated with aging is required to complement on-going risk reduction policies, programs and interventions. Studies measuring resilience among the elderly at the individual level have not produced a standard methodology. Moreover, resilience measurements need to incorporate external structural and system-level factors that determine the resources that adults can access while recovering from aging-related adversities. We use the National Academies of Science conceptualization of resilience for natural disasters to frame resilience for aging adults. This enables development of a generalized theory of resilience for different individual and structural contexts and populations, including a specific application to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Three-dimensional, organotypic models of the oral mucosa have been developed to study a wide variety of phenomena occurring in the oral cavity. Although a number of models have been developed in academic research labs, only a few models have been commercialized. Models from academic groups offer a broader range of phenotypes while the commercial models are more focused on the oral and gingival mucosa. The commercialized models are manufactured under highly controlled conditions and meet the requirements of quality standards, which leads to high levels of reproducibility. These in vitro models have been used to evaluate the irritancy of oral care products such as toothpastes, mouthwashes, and mucoadhesives. The effects of cigarette smoke on oral cavity tissues have been studied and compared to those of e-cigarettes. Oral tissue models have facilitated investigation of the mechanisms of oral mucositis and oral candidiasis and have been used to examine transbuccal drug delivery rates and the absorption of nanoparticles. Infection studies have investigated the effects of HIV-1 along with the effects of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. More recently, a differentiated oral tissue model has been shown to express the ACE2 receptor, which is known to be important for the receptor-mediated entry of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus into human cells and tissues. Hence, oral mucosal models may find application in determining whether viral infection of the oral mucosa is possible and whether such infection has implications vis-a-vis the current COVID-19 pandemic. As is apparent, these models are used in a broad variety of applications and often offer advantages versus animal models in terms of reproducibility, avoiding species extrapolation, and the ethical concerns related to human and animal experimentation. The goals of this paper are to review commercially available models of the human buccal and gingival mucosa and highlight their use to gain a better understanding of a broad range of phenomena affecting tissues in the oral cavity.

AB  - The human sciences have witnessed a decades-long transition from an emphasis on theories centered on hermeneutics and the interpretation of meaning to a preoccupation with theories that privilege performance, action, and being/becoming. This essay develops out of the conceptual orientation of William James, which holds that all knowledge comes from experience, as well as the author's writings on what matters most to participants in local worlds. The essay shows how meaning and being/becoming are unified in moral life and understood as embodied and lived experiences of care and caregiving, and it draws upon the author's experience of being the primary family carer for his late wife, who died of early onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as his experience of self-isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic. The essay's intention is to advance theoretical questions raised in the author's 2019 book The Soul of Care: The Moral Education of a Husband and a Doctor.

AB  - The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface and subsequently enters host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Additional cell receptors may be directly or indirectly involved, including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation through processes such as autophagy. Here, we measured the binding affinity of predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin β3 with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 μ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin β3 bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation. Our results provide molecular links between cell receptors and mediators of endocytosis and autophagy that may facilitate viral entry and propagation.

AB  - This paper summarizes the methodology for the registry of suspected COVID-19 in emergency care (RECOVER), a large clinical registry of patients from 155 United States (US) emergency departments (EDs) in 27 states tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March-September 2020. The initial goals are to derive and test: (1) a pretest probability instrument for prediction of SARS-CoV-2 test results, and from this instrument, a set of simple criteria to exclude COVID-19 (the COVID-19 Rule-Out Criteria-the CORC rule), and (2) a prognostic instrument for those with COVID-19. Patient eligibility included any ED patient tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a nasal or oropharyngeal swab. Abstracted clinical data included 204 variables representing the earliest manifestation of infection, including week of testing, demographics, symptoms, exposure risk, past medical history, test results, admission status, and outcomes 30 days later. In addition to the primary goals, the registry will provide a vital platform for characterizing the course, epidemiology, clinical features, and prognosis of patients tested for COVID-19 in the ED setting.

AB  - Neutrophils are primary effector cells of innate immunity and fight infection by phagocytosis and degranulation. Activated neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to a variety of stimuli. These NETs are net-like complexes composed of cell-free DNA, histones and neutrophil granule proteins. Besides the evolutionarily conserved mechanism to capture and eliminate pathogens, NETs are also associated with pathophysiological processes of various diseases. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms of NET formation and their different implications in disease. We focused on autoinflammatory and cardiovascular disorders as the leading cause of death. Neutrophil extracellular traps are not only present in various cardiovascular diseases but play an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque formation, arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, NETosis can be considered as a source of autoantigens and maintains an inflammatory milieu promoting autoimmune diseases. Indeed, there is further need for research into the balance between NET induction, inhibition, and degradation in order to pharmacologically target NETs and their compounds without impairing the patient's immune defense. This review may be of interest to both basic scientists and clinicians to stimulate translational research and innovative clinical approaches.

AB  - Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus-2) has been spreading rapidly in the sense of a global pandemic. This poses significant challenges for clinicians and hospitals and is placing unprecedented strain on the healthcare systems of many countries. The majority of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) present with only mild symptoms such as cough and fever. However, about 6 % require hospitalization. Early clarification of whether inpatient and, if necessary, intensive care treatment is medically appropriate and desired by the patient is of particular importance in the pandemic. Acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency with dyspnea and high respiratory rate (> 30/min) usually leads to admission to the intensive care unit. Often, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/consolidations or even pulmonary emboli are already found on imaging. As the disease progresses, some of these patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality reduction of available drug therapy in severe COVID-19 disease has only been demonstrated for dexamethasone in randomized controlled trials. The main goal of supportive therapy is to ensure adequate oxygenation. In this regard, invasive ventilation and repeated prone positioning are important elements in the treatment of severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic hygiene, including hand hygiene, and the correct wearing of adequate personal protective equipment are essential when handling patients. Medically necessary actions on patients that could result in aerosol formation should be performed with extreme care and preparation.

AB  - The extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the United States population is currently unknown. High quality serology is key to avoiding medically costly diagnostic errors, as well as to assuring properly informed public health decisions. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol, from antigen production to data analyses, that helps define thresholds for IgG and IgM seropositivity with high specificities. Validation of this protocol is performed using traditionally collected serum as well as dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits. Archival (pre-2019) samples are used as negative controls, and convalescent, PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 patient samples serve as positive controls. Using this protocol, minimal cross-reactivity is observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses, and no cross reactivity is observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI. Our protocol may thus help provide standardized, population-based data on the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, immunity and infection.

AB  - The development of clinical reasoning abilities is a core competency of emergency medicine (EM) resident education and has historically been accomplished through case conferences and clinical learning. The advent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has fundamentally changed these traditional learning opportunities by causing a nationwide reliance on virtual education environments and reducing the clinical diversity of cases encountered by EM trainees.We propose an innovative case conference that combines low-fidelity simulation with elements of gamification to foster the development of clinical reasoning skills and increase engagement among trainees during a virtual conference. After a team of residents submits a real clinical case that challenged their clinical reasoning abilities, a different team of residents "plays" through a gamified, simulated version of the case live on a video conference call. The case concludes with a facilitated debriefing led by a simulation-trained faculty, where both the resident teams and live virtual audience discuss the challenges of the case. Participants described how the Challenging Case Conference improved their perceptions of their clinical reasoning skills. Audience members reported increased engagement compared to traditional conferences. Participants also reported an unexpected, destigmatizing effect on the discussion of medical errors produced by this exercise. Residency programs could consider implementing a similar case conference as a component of their conference curriculum.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide, with no dedicated treatment or vaccine currently available. As pharmaceutical research against and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their efficacy, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C&gt;T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A&gt;G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher positive selection in mutant isolates early on, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNecla Kochan was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK-STAR).

AB  - COVID-19 has joined the long list of sexually dimorphic human disorders. Higher lethality in men, evident in the first reports from China, was confirmed in the subsequent Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and behavioral differences that may underlie it. However, little appeared to be released about sex differences in severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests performed. Systematic analysis of official websites for 20 countries and 6 US states revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful reported cases by sex. None of the other characteristics, including deaths, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, we found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases. In countries where a male bias was initially reported, the proportion of women dramatically increased in 3 weeks. Analysis also revealed a complex pattern of sex ratio variation with age. Accurate, peer-reviewed, analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities, will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by governments.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to spread with devastating consequences. For passive immunization efforts, nanobodies have size and cost advantages over conventional antibodies. Here, we generated four neutralizing nanobodies that target the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We defined two distinct binding epitopes using x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Based on the structures, we engineered multivalent nanobodies with more than 100-fold improved neutralizing activity than monovalent nanobodies. Biparatopic nanobody fusions suppressed the emergence of escape mutants. Several nanobody constructs neutralized through receptor-binding competition, while other monovalent and biparatopic nanobodies triggered aberrant activation of the spike fusion machinery. These premature conformational changes in the spike protein forestalled productive fusion, and rendered the virions non-infectious.

AB  - The accelerated growth of commercial flights has resulted in a huge upswing of air travelers over the last few decades, including passengers with a wide range of cardiovascular conditions. Notwithstanding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has set back the aviation industry for the next 1-2 years, air travel is expected to rebound fully by 2024. Guidelines and evidence-based recommendations for safe air travel in this group vary, and physicians often encounter situations where opinions and assessments on fitness for flights are sought. This article aims to provide an updated suite of recommendations for the aeromedical disposition of passenger with uncommon cardiovascular conditions, such as congenital heart diseases, inflammatory cardiac conditions (endocarditis/pericarditis/myocarditis), pulmonary hypertension, and venous thromboembolism. In addition, the article also aims to provide practical general guidance for the aeromedical examiner in evaluating, preparing, and optimizing the cardiac status of the patient with cardiovascular ailments for air travel.

AB  - Remdesivir is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3'-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3'-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched and located with the template base in the active center, and this may impair proofreading by the viral 3'-exonuclease. These mechanistic insights should facilitate the quest for improved antivirals that target coronavirus replication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to forward the implementation of an operational evidence-based state screening program of common diseases in Ukraine, where currently no state-based and evidence-based screening (EBS) exists. EBS should be performed by Family Doctors in a primary care setting and concern prevalent diseases in adults, such as: obesity (BMI), hypertension (BP measurement), diabetes (glycaemia), dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids), colon cancer (FOBT/colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), STIs (chlamydia, syphilis), HIV, HBV, HCV (i.e. serology or other rapid tests), HPV (swabs), cervical cancer (test Pap). depression (i.e., PHQ-9), and smoking (i.e., Fagerstrom). METHODS: Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine. RESULTS: Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform "Screening adviser" to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement. The presented SWOT-analysis of this ongoing implementation process allows to plan and optimize future steps towards a state based and supports EBS program in Ukraine.

AB  - Determining the presence of antibodies in serum is important for epidemiological studies, to be able to confirm whether a person has been infected, predicting risks of them getting sick and spreading the disease. During the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, a positive serological test result can suggest if it is safe to return to work and re-engage in social activities. Despite a multitude of emerging tests, the quality of respective data often remains ambiguous, yielding a significant fraction of false positive results. The human organism produces polyclonal antibodies specific to multiple viral proteins, so testing simultaneously for multiple antibodies appeared a practical approach for increasing test specificity. We analyzed immune response and testing potential for a spectrum of antigens derived from the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2, developed a dual-antigen testing system in the ELISA format and designed a robust algorithm for data processing. Combining nucleocapsid protein and receptor-binding domain for analysis allowed us to completely eliminate false positive results in the tested cohort (achieving specificity within a 95% confidence interval of 97.2-100%). We also tested samples collected from different households, and demonstrated differences in the immune response of COVID-19 patients and their family members; identifying, in particular, asymptomatic cases showing strong presence of studied antibodies, and cases showing none despite confirmed close contacts with the infected individuals.

AB  - This study develops a spatial Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model that analyzes the effect of interregional mobility on the spatial spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Japan. National and local governments have requested that residents refrain from traveling between 47 prefectures during the state of emergency. However, the extent to which restricting the interregional mobility prevents infection expansion has not been elucidated. Our spatial SEIR model describes the spatial spread pattern of COVID-19 when people commute to a prefecture where they work or study during the daytime and return to their residential prefecture at night. We assume that people are exposed to infection risk during their daytime activities. According to our simulation results, interregional mobility restriction can prevent geographical expansion of the infection. However, in prefectures with many infectious individuals, residents are exposed to higher infection risk when their mobility is restricted. Our simulation results also show that interregional mobility restriction plays a limited role in reducing the national total number of infected individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research received no external funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not applicable.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Recent studies suggested a link between long-term exposure to air-pollution and COVID-19 mortality. However, due to their ecological design based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 mortality in England using high geographical resolution. In this nationwide cross-sectional study in England, we included 38,573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level (n = 32,844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014-2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. We find a 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%, 1.2%) and 1.4% (95% CrI: -2.1%, 5.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality risk for every 1 μg/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect equal to 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2.5 remains more uncertain.

AB  - Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory tract infection in two meta-analyses. Mendelian randomization shows a causal effect of low vitamin D on bacterial pneumonias risk. These studies involved patients before COVID-19 pandemic. Several association studies found higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, greater COVID-19 severity and higher risk of mortality in vitamin D deficient subjects compared to vitamin D non-deficient controls. We draw attention to the trend of inverse relative COVID-19 mortality in Europe versus the states of the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, Brazil, South Africa) in dependence on season, which may be associated with intensity of ultraviolet radiation and consequent seasonal fluctuation of serum vitamin D levels. Although we cannot yet confirm causal role of vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 positivity or COVID-19, we recommend consumption of vitamin D rich food or vitamin D supplementation in the non-sunny season to prevent vitamin D deficiency.

AB  - Viral diseases are considered as a global burden. The eradication of viral diseases is always a challenging task in medical research due to the high infectivity and mutation capability of the virus. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is still not under control even after several months of the first reported case and global spread. Neither a specific drug nor a vaccine is available for public use yet. In the pursuit of a promising strategy, carbon dots could be considered as potential nanostructure against this viral pandemic. This review explores the possibility of carbon nano-dots to combat COVID-19 based on some reported studies. Carbon dots are photoluminescent carbon nanoparticles, smaller than 10 nm in dimension with a very attractive photostable and biocompatible properties which can be surfaced modified or functionalized. These photoluminescent tiny particles have captured much attention owing to their functionalization property and biocompatibility. In response to this pandemic outbreak, this review attempts to summarize the potential use of carbon dots in antiviral therapy with particular emphasis on their probable role in the battlefront against COVID-19 including their possible biosensing applications.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global health crisis. The susceptibility of pregnant women to infections has raised many questions about the risk of transmission, teratogenic risk and maternal and fetal complications. The speed at which the infection advanced as well as the ambiguity effects on pregnancy, due to the absence of scientific data, led obstetricians to adapt their practice according to pragmatic approach. We focused on this subject declared by the WHO as a global pandemic in early March 2020 to develop a plan for obstetric management of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients on the basis of current data. Based on the literature and the case of a patient hospitalized in our Department of Gynecology in Mahdia, the purpose of this study was to describe the possible clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and to develop principles of management of patients with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Greece is a European-Union country, of around 10 million people, located in the southeast part of Europe. The economy is recovering from a long period of deep recession, due to the economic crisis that started in 2008. The economic problems greatly influenced the structure and resources of the healthcare system of the country. In addition to the economic challenges, the country has been facing a refugee crisis, characterized by many overcrowded hotspots and tensions with neighboring Turkey. The COVID-19 outbreak arrived in Greece on 26 February 2020, at the time that Athens had declared a state of emergency at the Greek/Turkish border. From this point in time the government enforced a series of measurements, aiming to contain the epidemic and avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. The vast majority of the general population complied to the measures and consequently Greece's death toll was low. The impacts of the outbreak are expected to be, as everywhere worldwide, multifaceted and to affect many parts of the economic, social and political life of the country.

AB  - Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, mask wearing and social distancing have been the primary measures to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is strong population wide adherence which needs to be facilitated by information on the current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place. Here we address the issue of communication on the pandemic by offering data and analysis of online news media coverage of COVID-19.Methods We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available at http://sciride.org). Using topic detection we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage pandemic received in 2020. Sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 articles to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.Findings We find that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-speaking sources reveals that the overall COVID-19 coverage cannot be simply classified as negative due to the disease subject matter, suggesting a wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-speaking articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear or crisis.Interpretation The goal of pandemic public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and maximize the impact of any governmental policy. Our results suggest an information overload in COVID-19 reporting that could risk obscuring effective policy communication. We hope that our data and analysis will inform health communication strategy to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination regimes are being introduced.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSB would like to acknowledge the BMGF, the Academy of Medical Sciences, The NIHR BRC and the UKRI.

AB  - SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic considerably affects health, wellbeing, social, economic and other aspects of daily life. The impact of COVID-19 on blood pressure (BP) control and hypertension remains insufficiently explored. We therefore provide a comprehensive review of the potential changes in lifestyle factors and behaviours as well as environmental changes likely to influence BP control and cardiovascular risk during the pandemic. This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight. Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotional/psychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise. We also highlight potential preventive measures to improve BP control because hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for worldwide health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease which has had a rapid surge in cases and deaths since it is first documented in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the Betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is highly expressed in the human lower respiratory tract but also in other tissues, as the cellular entry receptor. Thus, COVID-19 mainly affects the respiratory system but can cause damage to other body systems, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, renal, and central nervous systems. We review the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the infection, focusing on our current understanding of the disease mechanisms and their translation to clinical outcomes, as well as adverse effects on different body systems. We also discuss the epidemiology pathogenesis, clinical, and multi-organ consequences, and highlight some of the research gaps regarding COVID-19.

AB  - The ability to distinguish between erratic and systematic patterns of change in case count data is crucial for assessing and projecting the course of disease outbreaks. Here, it is shown that measuring the strength of trends can provide information that is not readily captured by commonly used descriptive indicators. In combination with the 7-day moving average, Bandt and Pompe's permutation entropy and Wilder's relative strength index were found to support the timely detection of coronavirus epidemic trends and transitions in data from various countries. The results demonstrate that measuring the strength of epidemic growth trends in addition to their magnitude can significantly enhance disease surveillance.

AB  - The quality of healthcare service websites gains particular importance in the time of the pandemic, asthe popularity of electronic services grows. This applies to infectious disease hospitals as well, often on the front line of the effort against COVID-19. The paper aims to assess the quality of infectious disease hospital websites in Poland in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research covered 91 websites. The first stage was an analysis of selected technical attributes of the websites (including website performance, SEO quality, website availability, and mobile-friendliness) with selected online tools, such as Google PageSpeed Insights, Blink Audit Tool, Backlink Checker, andwebsite accessibility evaluation tool (WAVE). The data were then analyzed with statistical methods. The next step was to analyze the content of the websites. The research has shown that most of the websites were of satisfactory quality, apart from those that were not mobile-ready. The following keywords were found most often on the hospital websites: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, smear, specialist care clinic, isolation, telephone consultations, sample collection center, support, coronavirus, recommendations, patient registration, signs of disease. The research suggests that the quality of infectious disease hospital websites in Poland is significantly diversified in search engine optimization, mobile-friendliness, and needs of people at risk of digital exclusion.

AB  - Here we adapt and evaluate a full-face snorkel mask for use as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, who lack appropriate alternatives during the COVID-19 crisis in the spring of 2020. The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic is a major threat to public health affecting the world; it has been identified as originating in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. It is spreading widely and rapidly spread across the globe, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. Such global outburst is associated with adverse effects on mental health. Fear, stress, anxiety seem more definitely an outcome of mass quarantine. METHODS: Keeping this pandemic situation in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 crisis relevant to mental health was redeemed via a literature search from PubMed database. Collected published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. RESULTS: Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of self-reported stress, anxiety and depression are common psychological impact to the pandemic, and may be associated with disrupted sleep. Regional, state, National-international borders have almost been shut down, economies crashed, and billions of people quarantined or isolated at their own homes and quarantine centers. In this situational frame of covid-19, patients, front-line healthcare professionals, geriatric population with existing psychiatric conditions may be encountering further suffering. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 will continue to affect mental health and wellbeing intensely; also, mental health serves an important role in battling the epidemic. With the scare of COVID-19 pandemic on the rise, it is time that as psychiatrists should try to integrate the health-care services keeping mental health at prime.

AB  - Here we look into the spread of aerosols indoors that may potentially carry viruses. Many viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2, are known to spread via airborne and air-dust pathways. From the literature data and our research on the propagation of fine aerosols, we simulate herein the carryover of viral aerosols in indoor air. We demonstrate that a lot of fine droplets released from an infected person's coughing, sneezing, or talking propagate very fast and for large distances indoors, as well as bend around obstacles, lift up and down over staircases, and so on. This study suggests equations to evaluate the concentration of those droplets, depending on time and distance from the source of infection. Estimates are given for the safe distance to the source of infection, and available methods for neutralizing viral aerosols indoors are considered.

It surveys the litigation challenging each of the relatively few restrictions that were imposed, considers when and whether courts should apply the deferential Jacobson standard, the Heller Second Amendment analysis, or both, and explores the possibility that the unsettled nature of Second Amendment jurisprudence makes it likely that challenges to emergency firearms restrictions could result in dramatic developments in what the Second Amendment protects.

AB  - This manuscript provides a protocol for in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) coupled with immunofluorescence to visualize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in cell line and three-dimensional (3D) cultures of human airway epithelium. The method allows highly specific and sensitive visualization of viral RNA by relying on HCR initiated by probe localization. Split-initiator probes help amplify the signal by fluorescently labeled amplifiers, resulting in negligible background fluorescence in confocal microscopy. Labeling amplifiers with different fluorescent dyes facilitates the simultaneous recognition of various targets. This, in turn, allows the mapping of the infection in tissues to better understand viral pathogenesis and replication at the single-cell level. Coupling this method with immunofluorescence may facilitate better understanding of host-virus interactions, including alternation of the host epigenome and immune response pathways. Owing to sensitive and specific HCR technology, this protocol can also be used as a diagnostic tool. It is also important to remember that the technique may be modified easily to enable detection of any RNA, including non-coding RNAs and RNA viruses that may emerge in the future.

AB  - Being opportunistic intracellular pathogens, viruses are dependent on the host for their replication. They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified. This review discusses various host and virus-mediated PTMs that play a role in the outcome during the infection.

AB  - Wastewater-based Epidemiological (WBE) surveillance offers a promising approach to assess the pandemic situation covering pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in highly populated area under limited clinical tests. In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (∼120%) and ORF 1ab (∼38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (∼924.5 copies/ L) than August (∼897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a ∼ 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.HIGHLIGHTS□ Study unravels the early warning potential of wastewater based surveillance of COVID-19.□ Adequate SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected despite of limited reported case in the vicinity.□ Up to 2 weeks of lead is possible from a regular wastewater based COVID-19 surveillance.□ SARS-CoV-2 RNA was higher in September than August in response to a ∼ 2.2-fold rise in COVID-19 active cases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is funded by Kiran C Patel Centre for Sustainable Development at IIT Gandhinagar, UNICEF, Gujarat and UK-India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI).

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a significant public health emergency in recent times. It is a respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially reported in late December 2019. In a span of 6 months, this pandemic spread across the globe leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Soon after the identification of the causative virus, questions concerning the impact of environmental factors on the dissemination and transmission of the virus, its persistence in environmental matrices, and infectivity potential begin to emerge. As the environmental factors could have far-reaching consequences on infection dissemination and severity, it is essential to understand the linkage between these factors and the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to improve our current understanding over this topic, the present article summarizes topical and substantial observations made regarding the influences of abiotic environmental factors such as climate, temperature, humidity, wind speed, air, and water quality, solid surfaces/interfaces, frozen food, and biotic factors like age, sex, gender, blood type, population density, behavioural characteristics, etc. on the transmission, persistence, and infectivity of this newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, the potential pathways of virus transmission that could pose risk to population health have been discussed, and the critical areas have been identified which merits urgent research for the assessment and management of the COVID-19 outbreak. Where possible, the knowledge gaps requiring further investigation have been highlighted.

AB  - The current life-threatening and tenacious pandemic eruption of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a significant global hazard concerning high mortality rate, economic meltdown, and everyday life distress. The rapid spread of COVID-19 demands countermeasures to combat this deadly virus. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19. Therefore, discovering small molecule therapeutics for treating COVID-19 infection is essential. So far, only a few small molecule inhibitors are reported for coronaviruses. There is a need to expand the small chemical space of coronaviruses inhibitors by adding potent and selective scaffolds with anti-COVID activity. In this context, the huge antiviral chemical space already available can be analysed using cheminformatic and machine learning to unearth new scaffolds. We created three specific datasets called "antiviral dataset" (N = 38,428) "drug-like antiviral dataset" (N = 20,963) and "anticorona dataset" (N = 433) for this purpose. We analyzed the 433 molecules of "anticorona dataset" for their scaffold diversity, physicochemical distributions, principal component analysis, activity cliffs, R-group decomposition, and scaffold mapping. The scaffold diversity of the "anticorona dataset" in terms of Murcko scaffold analysis demonstrates a thorough representation of diverse chemical scaffolds. However, physicochemical descriptor analysis and principal component analysis demonstrated negligible drug-like features for the "anticorona dataset" molecules. The "antiviral dataset" and "drug-like antiviral dataset" showed low scaffold diversity as measured by the Gini coefficient. The hierarchical clustering of the "antiviral dataset" against the "anticorona dataset" demonstrated little molecular similarity. We generated a library of frequent fragments and polypharmacological ligands targeting various essential viral proteins such as main protease, helicase, papain-like protease, and replicase polyprotein 1ab. Further structural and chemical features of the "anticorona dataset" were compared with SARS-CoV-2 repurposed drugs, FDA-approved drugs, natural products, and drugs currently in clinical trials. Using machine learning tool DCA (DMax Chemistry Assistant), we converted the "anticorona dataset" into an elegant hypothesis with significant functional biological relevance. Machine learning analysis uncovered that FDA approved drugs, Tizanidine HCl, Cefazolin, Raltegravir, Azilsartan, Acalabrutinib, Luliconazole, Sitagliptin, Meloxicam (Mobic), Succinyl sulfathiazole, Fluconazole, and Pranlukast could be repurposed as effective drugs for COVID-19. Fragment-based scaffold analysis and R-group decomposition uncovered pyrrolidine and the indole molecular scaffolds as the potent fragments for designing and synthesizing the novel drug-like molecules for targeting SARS-CoV-2. This comprehensive and systematic assessment of small-molecule viral therapeutics' entire chemical space realised critical insights to potentially privileged scaffolds that could aid in enrichment and rapid discovery of efficacious antiviral drugs for COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-cell (sc) sequencing performs unbiased profiling of individual cells and enables evaluation of less prevalent cellular populations, often missed using bulk sequencing. However, the scale and the complexity of the sc datasets poses a great challenge in its utility and this problem is further exacerbated when working with larger datasets typically generated by consortium efforts. As the scale of single cell datasets continues to increase exponentially, there is an unmet technological need to develop database platforms that can evaluate key biological hypotheses by querying extensive single-cell datasets. Large single-cell datasets like Human Cell Atlas and COVID-19 cell atlas (collection of annotated sc datasets from various human organs) are excellent resources for profiling target genes involved in human diseases and disorders ranging from oncology, auto-immunity, as well as infectious diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 infections have led to a worldwide pandemic with massive loss of lives, infections exceeding 7 million cases. The virus uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as key viral entry associated proteins expressed in human cells for infections. Evaluating the expression profile of key genes in large single-cell datasets can facilitate testing for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine targets, as the world struggles to cope with the on-going spread of COVID-19 infections. MAIN BODY: In this manuscript we describe REVEAL: SingleCell, which enables storage, retrieval, and rapid query of single-cell datasets inclusive of millions of cells. The array native database described here enables selecting and analyzing cells across multiple studies. Cells can be selected using individual metadata tags, more complex hierarchical ontology filtering, and gene expression threshold ranges, including co-expression of multiple genes. The tags on selected cells can be further evaluated for testing biological hypotheses. One such example includes identifying the most prevalent cell type annotation tag on returned cells. We used REVEAL: SingleCell to evaluate the expression of key SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes, and queried the current database (2.2 Million cells, 32 projects) to obtain the results in < 60 s. We highlighted cells expressing COVID-19 associated genes are expressed on multiple tissue types, thus in part explains the multi-organ involvement in infected patients observed worldwide during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we introduce the REVEAL: SingleCell database that addresses immediate needs for SARS-CoV-2 research and has the potential to be used more broadly for many precision medicine applications. We used the REVEAL: SingleCell database as a reference to ask questions relevant to drug development and precision medicine regarding cell type and co-expression for genes that encode proteins necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to enter and reproduce in cells.

AB  - The outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the entire world with its infectious spread and mortality rate. The severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are characterized by hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the absence of any specific treatment, just the preventive and supportive care options are available. Therefore, much focus is given to assess the available therapeutic options not only to avoid acute respiratory failure and hypoxia but also to reduce the viral load to control the severity of the disease. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is among the much-discussed drugs for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients. This article reviews the therapeutic potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 based on the available in vitro and clinical evidence, current status of registered HCQ-based clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for COVID-19, and environmental implications of HCQ.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess if telemedicine can be used successfully for follow-up care of children with respiratory illnesses. The authors also assessed problems faced by the doctors and satisfaction of caregivers of these patients with telemedicine. METHODS: The authors conducted an ambispective observational study. Data related to demographic details and diagnoses of patients who had telemedicine consultation (teleconsultation) appointments between 2nd April 2020 to 15th May 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. They noted proportion of patients having successful prescription. To assess problems faced by doctors and satisfaction of caregiver of patients with teleconsultation, a prospective questionnaire was sent via Google Forms 6-10 wk after the initial appointment date. Those who did not respond to Google Forms were called by phone to assess the same. RESULTS: A total of 188 patients received teleconsultation during the study period. Team was able to prescribe treatment in 181 (96.3%) patients via teleconsultation and other seven (3.7%) required physical evaluation. Mean (SD) age of patients was 9.7 (4.9) y, range 3 mo to 18 y. There were 117 (62.2%) boys and 71 (37.8%) girls. Majority (58%) of the patients were asthmatics. The team advised refill prescription in 83% patients as symptoms were controlled. Three out of five residents faced minor problems while providing teleconsultation. In satisfaction assessment, 78% of caregivers rated teleconsultation 8 or more, out of 10 points, suggesting that most of them were satisfied with telemedicine. CONCLUSION: In majority of children with respiratory illnesses, successful follow-up care can be provided by telemedicine.

AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus in 2019 has shaken the whole world and it quickly evolved as a global pandemic, placing everyone in a panic situation. Considering its long-term effects on day to day lives, the necessity of wearing face mask and social distancing brings in picture the requirement of a contact less biometric system for all future authentication systems. One of the solutions is to use periocular biometric as it does not need physical contact like fingerprint biometric and is able to identify even people wearing face masks. Since, the periocular region is a small area as compared to face, extraction of required number of features from that small region is the major concern to make the system highly robust. This research proposes a feature fusion approach which combines the handcrafted features HOG, non-handcrafted features extracted using pretrained CNN models and gender related features extracted using a five layer CNN model. The proposed feature fusion approach is evaluated using multiclass SVM classifier with three different benchmark databases, UBIPr, Color FERET and Ethnic Ocular as well as for three non-ideal scenarios i.e. the effect of eyeglasses, effect of eye occlusion and pose variations. The proposed approach shows remarkable improvement in performance over pre-existing approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To investigate the risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation in patients undergoing long-term tocilizumab therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. METHOD: From January 2011 through August 2019, a total of 97 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical data, comedications, and the occurrence of HBV reactivation were recorded. RESULTS: Seven patients were HBsAg+ (7.2%), 64 were HBsAg-/HBcAb+ (65.9%), and 26 were HBsAg-/HBcAb- (26.8%). The median disease follow-up time was 9 years. TCZ was administered for a median of 29 months. Four patients (4.1%) experienced HBV reactivation after tocilizumab therapy. Of the 7 HBsAg+ patients, 4 received antiviral prophylaxis and had no HBV reactivation; the remaining 3 patients did not receive antiviral prophylaxis, and all 3 (100%) experienced HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare-up. Hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 2 of these 3 patients, with mild prothrombin time prolongation in one. After salvage entecavir treatment, all patients had a favorable outcome. Of the 64 HBsAg-/HBcAb+ patients, only one became positive for serum HBV DNA (2.5 × 107 IU/mL) after 18 months of tocilizumab treatment (1.6%; 1/64). This patient was immediately treated with entecavir, which prevented hepatitis flare-up. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab is widely used in treating rheumatoid arthritis and has the potential to reduce the mortality rate among severe COVID-19 patients. However, HBV reactivation needs to be considered. HBsAg+ patients have a high risk of HBV reactivation, which could be prevented by antiviral prophylaxis. Although the risk of reactivation is low in HBsAg-/HBcAb+ patients, strict monitoring is necessary.

AB  - Complement is integral to a healthy functioning immune system and orchestrates various innate and adaptive responses against viruses and other pathogens. Despite its importance, the potential beneficial role of complement in immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been overshadowed by reports of extensive complement activation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Here, we hypothesize that complement may also have a protective role and could function to enhance virus neutralization by antibodies, promote virus phagocytosis by immune cells, and lysis of virus. These functions might be exploited in the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: First-year students entering postsecondary education must navigate a new and complex academic and social environment. Research indicates that this transition and developmental period can be challenging and stressful - academically, emotionally and socially - and that mental health and wellbeing can be compromised. Additionally, mental health disorders can also compromise students' ability to successfully navigate this transition. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the incoming 2020 cohort of first-year students face heightened and new challenges. Most will have spent the conclusion of high school learning virtually, in quarantine, in an uncertain and difficult time, and are then experiencing their first year of university while living, learning and socializing off-campus, virtually and remotely. In response to COVID-19 and with an appreciation of the considerable stresses students face generally and particularly in 2020-21, and the potential effects on mental health and wellbeing, McMaster University, a mid-sized research intensive university with approximately 30,000 students, has developed an innovative program to support students, called Archway. This initiative has been developed to help to prevent and to intervene early to address common transitional issues students experience that can influence mental health and wellbeing, with the ultimate goals of increasing student connectedness, supports, and retention. METHODS: The current study will use a mixed-method design to evaluate Archway and gain a better understanding of the transition into first-year postsecondary for students who engage and participate in Archway at various levels. The study will not only help to determine the effect of this program for students during COVID-19, but it will help us to better understand the challenges of this transition more broadly. DISCUSSION: Findings have the potential to inform future efforts to support students and protect their mental health and wellbeing through the use of virtual and remote platforms and mechanisms that meet their increasingly diverse needs and circumstances.

AB  - This article interrogates the politics of the COVID-19 pandemic from a postcolonial perspective. One alarming concern during the pandemic is the rise of racism against Asians all over the world. However, little explored behind media reports are the legacies, tensions and challenges left by imperial domination inherited from the past, especially within the postcolonial regimes in Asia, such as Hong Kong and China. Drawing upon postcolonialism as a critical lens, this article makes perceptible the intractable issues of health politics. Postcolonial challenges shown by COVID-19 include immigration, changing politico-juridical definitions of identity, the legacy left by the Soviet era which poses an obstacle to modernising China's healthcare system, and the boom of birth tourism welcomed by the marketised turn of health and tourism policy in Hong Kong in the post-SARS era. A postcolonial perspective invites health sociologists to scratch beneath the surface of political problems such as racism, and attend to the complex heterogeneity of health politics in the pandemic.

AB  - In this commentary, written in two bursts-the first completed in April 2020, and the second at the end of July-we explore how media metaphors of COVID-19 constitute the pandemic in Australia and New Zealand. We argue that the media's rhetorical strategies play an important role not only in describing the illness, but in influencing and shaping individual and collective responses to the pandemic, with significant consequences for mental health and well-being in the context of crisis. We align this commentary with the tenets of the sociology of diagnosis, which argue that even though there are material realities of disease, their social form and consequence cannot be separated from the tangible nature of illness and its management. We also lean on Derrida's approach to metaphor, which underlines how even observable viral entities such as COVID-19 are simultaneously material, abstract, and in flux. We describe the metaphors used by local media to describe the pandemic-including combat, bush fires, earthquakes, and other natural disasters-and we explore how and why these metaphors construct the pandemic locally and farther afield.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is occasionally associated with manifold diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We sought to present the neuroimaging features of such CNS involvement. In addition, we sought to identify typical neuroimaging patterns that could indicate possible COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. METHODS: In this systematic literature review, typical neuroimaging features of cerebrovascular diseases and inflammatory processes associated with COVID-19 were analyzed. Reports presenting individual patient data were included in further quantitative analysis with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified 115 studies reporting a total of 954 COVID-19 patients with associated neurological manifestations and neuroimaging alterations. A total of 95 (82.6%) of the identified studies were single case reports or case series, whereas 660 (69.2%) of the reported cases included individual information and were thus included in descriptive statistical analysis. Ischemia with neuroimaging patterns of large vessel occlusion event was revealed in 59.9% of ischemic stroke patients, whereas 69.2% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage exhibited bleeding in a location that was not associated with hypertension. Callosal and/or juxtacortical location was identified in 58.7% of cerebral microbleed positive images. Features of hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis were detected in 28.8% of patients with meningo-/encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS: Manifold CNS involvement is increasingly reported in COVID-19 patients. Typical and atypical neuroimaging features have been observed in some disease entities, so that familiarity with these imaging patterns appears reasonable and may assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 CNS manifestations.

AB  - Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are facing unprecedented challenges that affect our ability to run in-person experiments. With mandated social distancing in a controlled laboratory environment, many researchers are searching for alternative options to conduct research, such as online experimentation. However, online experimentation comes at a cost; learning online tools for building and publishing psychophysics experiments can be complicated and time-consuming. This learning cost is unfortunate because researchers typically only need to use a small percentage of these tools' capabilities, but they still have to deal with these systems' complexities (e.g., complex graphical user interfaces or difficult programming languages). Furthermore, after the experiment is built, researchers often have to find an online platform compatible with the tool they used to program the experiment. To simplify and streamline the online process of programming and hosting an experiment, I have created SimplePhy. SimplePhy can save researchers' time and energy by allowing them to create a study in just a few clicks. All researchers have to do is select among a few experiment settings and upload the stimuli. SimplePhy is able to run most psychophysical perception experiments that require mouse clicks and button presses. In addition to collecting online behavioral data, SimplePhy can also collect information regarding the estimated viewing distance between the participant and the monitor, the screen size, and the experimental trial's timing-features not always offered in other online platforms. Overall, SimplePhy is a simple, free, open-source tool (code can be found here: https://gitlab.com/malago/simplephy ) aimed to help labs conduct their experiments online.

AB  - Favipiravir (FPV) is a novel antiviral drug acting as a competitive inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), preventing viral transcription and replication. FPV was approved in Japan in 2014 for therapy of influenza unresponsive to standard antiviral therapies. FPV was also used in the therapy of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetic parameters, toxicity, and adverse effects of FPV, as well as clinical studies evaluating the use of FPV in the therapy of influenza virus (IV) infection, EVD, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its effectiveness in treating other human RNA infections.

AB  - Phylodynamic inference is a pivotal tool in understanding transmission dynamics of viral outbreaks. These analyses are strongly guided by the input of an epidemiological model as well as sequence data that must contain sufficient intersequence variability in order to be informative. These criteria, however, may not be met during the early stages of an outbreak. Here we investigate the impact of low diversity sequence data on phylodynamic inference using the birth-death and coalescent exponential models. Through our simulation study, estimating the molecular evolutionary rate required enough sequence diversity and is an essential first step for any phylodynamic inference. Following this, the birth-death model outperforms the coalescent exponential model in estimating epidemiological parameters, when faced with low diversity sequence data due to explicitly exploiting the sampling times. In contrast, the coalescent model requires additional samples and therefore variability in sequence data before accurate estimates can be obtained. These findings were also supported through our empirical data analyses of an Australian and a New Zealand cluster outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the birth-death model is more robust when applied to datasets with low sequence diversity given sampling is specified and this should be considered for future viral outbreak investigations.

AB  - In December 2019, an infectious disease caused by a new type of coronavirus infection was prevalent in Wuhan and across the country. On January 20, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China issued No.1 Announcement, which incorporated the novel coronavirus pneumonia into the Class B infectious disease according to the Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease, but the disease should be adopted in the management of Class A infectious disease. In order to effectively control the source of infection, cut off the transmission route, protect the susceptible population, ensure the medical quality and medical safety, perform epidemic prevention and control, and comprehensively guarantee the life safety and physical health of medical staff, patients, and family members, it is very important to organize and carry out nuclear medicine diagnosis and treatment scientifically and safely. According to the national prevention and control policy, Chinese Society of Nuclear Medicine and editorial board of the Chinese Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging organized professionals to formulate the expert consensus on the safety prevention process of nuclear medicine imaging and nuclide therapy during the period of new coronavirus infection.

AB  - Research universities have a strong devotion and advocacy for research in their core academic mission. This is why they are widely recognized for their excellence in research which make them take the most renowned positions in the different worldwide university leagues. In order to examine the uniqueness of this group of universities we analyze the scientific production of a sample of them in a 5 year period of time. On the one hand, we analyze their preferences in research measured with the relative percentage of publications in the different subject areas, and on the other hand, we calculate the similarity between them in research preferences. In order to select a set of research universities, we studied the leading university rankings of Shanghai, QS, Leiden, and Times Higher Education (THE). Although the four rankings own well established and developed methodologies and hold great prestige, we choose to use THE because data were readily available for doing the study we had in mind. Having done that, we selected the twenty academic institutions ranked with the highest score in the last edition of THE World University Rankings 2020 and to contrast their impact, we also, we compared them with the twenty institutions with the lowest score in this ranking. At the same time, we extracted publication data from Scopus database for each university and we applied bibliometrics indicators from Elsevier's SciVal. We applied the statistical techniques cosine similarity and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis to examine and compare affinities in research preferences among them. Moreover, a cluster analysis through VOSviewer was done to classify the total scientific production in the four major fields (health sciences, physical sciences, life sciences and social sciences). As expected, the results showed that top universities have strong research profiles, becoming the leaders in the world in those areas and cosine similarity pointed out that some are more affine among them than others. The results provide clues for enhancing existing collaboration, defining and re-directing lines of research, and seeking for new partnerships to face the current pandemic to find was to tackle down the covid-19 outbreak.

Data obtained from these devices is used to assist patient management and avoid heart failure hospitalizations. In this review, we outline the various devices, mechanisms they utilize, and effects on heart failure patients. RECENT FINDINGS: New applications of these devices to specific populations may expand the pool of patients that may benefit. In the COVID-19 pandemic with a growing emphasis on virtual visits, remote monitoring can add vital ancillary data. Wireless hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery pressure sensor is a highly effective and safe method to assess for worsening intracardiac pressures that may predict heart failure events, giving lead time that is valuable to keep patients optimized. Implantation of this device has been found to improve outcomes in heart failure patients regardless of preserved or reduced ejection fraction.

AB  - The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has raised questions about Fabry disease (FD) as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 symptoms. Available real-world data on 22 patients from an international group of healthcare providers reveals that most patients with FD experience mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms with an additional complication of Fabry pain crises and transient worsening of kidney function in some cases; however, two patients over the age of 55 years with renal or cardiac disease experienced critical COVID-19 complications. These outcomes support the theory that pre-existent tissue injury and inflammation may predispose patients with more advanced FD to a more severe course of COVID-19, while less advanced FD patients do not appear to be more susceptible than the general population. Given these observed risk factors, it is best to reinforce all recommended safety precautions for individuals with advanced FD. Diagnosis of FD should not preclude providing full therapeutic and organ support as needed for patients with FD and severe or critical COVID-19, although a FD-specific safety profile review should always be conducted prior to initiating COVID-19-specific therapies. Continued specific FD therapy with enzyme replacement therapy, chaperone therapy, dialysis, renin-angiotensin blockers or participation to clinical trials during the pandemic is recommended as FD progression will only increase susceptibility to infection. In order to compile outcome data and inform best practices, an international registry for patients affected by Fabry and infected by COVID-19 should be established.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are prescribed antibiotics is uncertain, and may contribute to patient harm and global antibiotic resistance. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic use in patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9, 2020. Inclusion criteria were any healthcare settings and age groups; randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with >10 patients; experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness, and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30,623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3 to 80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.33) compared to adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95%CI 1.18 to 1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection. Unnecessary antibiotic use is likely high in patients with COVID-19. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (ID CRD42020192286).

AB  - Biospecimen research is a prominent investigative strategy that aims to provide novel insights into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), inform clinical trials, and develop effective, life-saving treatments. However, COVID-19 biospecimen research raises accompanying ethical concerns and practical challenges for investigators and participants. In this special article, we discuss the ethical issues that are associated with autonomy, beneficence, and justice in COVID-19 biospecimen research and describe strategies to manage the practical challenges, with an emphasis on protecting the rights and welfare of human research participants during a pandemic response. Appropriate institutional review board oversight and bioethics guidance for COVID-19 biospecimen research must maintain their focus on protecting the rights and welfare of research participants, despite the urgent need for more knowledge about the virus and the threat it poses to communities and nations.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a network machine learning method to identify potential bioactive anti-COVID-19 molecules in foods based on their capacity to target the SARS-CoV-2-host gene-gene (protein-protein) interactome. Our analyses were performed using a supercomputing DreamLab App platform, harnessing the idle computational power of thousands of smartphones. Machine learning models were initially calibrated by demonstrating that the proposed method can predict anti-COVID-19 candidates among experimental and clinically approved drugs (5658 in total) targeting COVID-19 interactomics with the balanced classification accuracy of 80-85% in 5-fold cross-validated settings. This identified the most promising drug candidates that can be potentially "repurposed" against COVID-19 including common drugs used to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin and metformin. A database of 7694 bioactive food-based molecules was run through the calibrated machine learning algorithm, which identified 52 biologically active molecules, from varied chemical classes, including flavonoids, terpenoids, coumarins and indoles predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-host interactome networks. This in turn was used to construct a "food map" with the theoretical anti-COVID-19 potential of each ingredient estimated based on the diversity and relative levels of candidate compounds with antiviral properties. We expect this in silico predicted food map to play an important role in future clinical studies of precision nutrition interventions against COVID-19 and other viral diseases.

AB  - Infectious diseases generate spatial dependence or contagion not only between individuals but also between geographical units. New infections in one local district do not just depend on properties of the district, but also on the strength of social ties of its population with populations in other districts and their own degree of infectiousness. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infections during the first wave of the pandemic spread across district borders in England as a function of pre-crisis commute to work streams between districts. Crucially, the strength of this spatial contagion depends on the phase of the epidemic. In the first pre-lockdown phase, the spread of the virus across district borders is high. During the lockdown period, the cross-border spread of new infections slows down significantly. Spatial contagion increases again after the lockdown is eased but not statistically significantly so.

AB  - While a number of human coronaviruses are believed to be originated from ancestral viruses in bats, it remains unclear if bat coronaviruses are ready to cause direct bat-to-human transmission. Here, we report the isolation of a MERS-related coronavirus, Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4, from lesser bamboo bats. Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4 replicates efficiently in human colorectal adenocarcinoma and hepatocarcinoma cells with cytopathic effects, and can utilize human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and dromedary camel-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 as the receptors for cell entry. Flow cytometry, co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance assays show that Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4-receptor-binding-domain can bind human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, dromedary camel-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, and Tylonycteris pachypus-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4. Tylonycteris-bat-CoV-HKU4 can infect human-dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-transgenic mice by intranasal inoculation with self-limiting disease. Positive virus and inflammatory changes were detected in lungs and brains of infected mice, associated with suppression of antiviral cytokines and activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The results suggest that MERS-related bat coronaviruses may overcome species barrier by utilizing dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 and potentially emerge in humans by direct bat-to-human transmission.

AB  - Adaptive leadership has become an essential skill for leaders in health systems to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as new knowledge emerges and case counts rise, fall, and rise again. This leadership approach has been described as an iterative process of taking a wide view of the situation, interpreting the meaning of incoming data from multiple directions, and taking real-time action. This process is also common in start-ups, which attempt to create new products or services of uncertain value for consumer markets that may not yet exist. Start-ups manage uncertainty through "pivots," which can include changes in the target group, need, features, or intended benefit of a product or service. Pivots are large changes that account for the high likelihood of getting something wrong during development, and they are distinct from the "tweaks" or small tests of change that define quality improvement methodology. This case study describes three pivots in the launch of a remote monitoring program for COVID-19. Adaptive leadership helped inform strategic decisions, with pivots providing a framework for internal and external stakeholders to articulate options for changes to address shifting needs. There is considerable uncertainty in the appropriate design and implementation of health services, and although this case example focuses on the use of adaptive leadership and pivots during a pandemic, these strategies are relevant for health care leaders at any time.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the use of social media platforms by medical students, surgical trainees, and practicing surgeons for surgical education during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: An online, 15-question survey was developed and posted on Facebook and WhatsApp closed surgeon groups. Results: The online survey was completed by 219 participants from South America (87%), North America (7%), Europe (5%), Central America, and Asia. Respondents included medical students (6.4%), surgical residents/fellows (24.2%), and practicing surgeons (69.4%). The most common age group was 35-44 years. When asked which social media platforms they preferred, the video sharing site YouTube (33.3%), the messaging app WhatsApp (21%), and "other" (including videoconferencing sites) (22.3%) were most popular. Respondents reported using social media for surgical education either daily (38.4%) or weekly (45.2%), for an average of 1-5 hours/week. Most (85%) opined that surgical conferences that were cancelled during the pandemic should be made available online, with live discussions. Conclusion: Social media use for surgical education during Covid-19 appears to be increasing and evolving.

AB  - THE CONTEXT: among the community health services representing a resource to face the COVID-19 emergency, there are the Family Care Centres (FCCs). A national study coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, recently described their activities and needs, highlighting a large interregional variability in the number of centres and staff availability. Ante and post-natal care, cervical cancer screening and actions addressed at teenagers are the FCCs strategic activities. THE CF IN FRONT OF COVID-19: despite the need to limit the offer of care to the services that cannot be postponed during the lockdown, many FCCs have been exemplary in promptly reorganizing activities in the new context. The paper presents a selection of experiences carried out from March to June 2020 by some FCCs in different Italian Regions concerning FCCs strategic activities. CONCLUSIONS: the combined reading of some of the results of the ISS study and of the activities implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a measure of the ability of the FCCs to respond to the needs of the community and to adapt to change. These services based on an innovative health model deserve enhancement and support.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global crisis, one which also influences the ways sustainability is being taught at universities. This paper undertakes an analysis of the extent to which COVID-19 as a whole and the lockdown it triggered in particular, which has led to the suspension of presence-based teaching in universities worldwide and influenced teaching on matters related to sustainable development. By means of a worldwide survey involving higher education institutions across all continents, the study has identified a number of patterns, trends and problems. The results from the study show that the epidemic has significantly affected teaching practices. The lockdowns have led to a surge in the use of on-line communication tools as a partial replacement to normal lessons. In addition, many faculty teaching sustainability in higher education have strong competencies in digital literacy. The sampled higher education educations have-as a whole-adequate infrastructure to continue to teach during the lockdowns. Finally, the majority of the sample revealed that they miss the interactions via direct face-to-face student engagement, which is deemed as necessary for the effective teaching of sustainability content. The implications of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, it describes how sustainability teaching on sustainable development has been affected by the lockdown. Secondly, it describes some of the solutions deployed to overcome the problem. Finally, the paper outlines the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic may serve the purpose of showing how university teaching on sustainability may be improved in the future, taking more advantage of modern information technologies.

AB  - Purpose In this article, we draw a parallel between the experience of social isolation that occurred throughout the world during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic and similar experiences occurring in everyday life for people with communication disorders living in long-term care (LTC) facilities. We propose that speech-language pathologists can use the widespread experience of social isolation as a learning catalyst in the effort to shift the LTC culture to one that more highly values a communicative environment that is accessible to all, thereby reducing risk of social isolation for those with communication disorders. Conclusions Many training paradigms for promoting an accessible communicative environment are available in the speech-language pathology literature, yet institutional barriers exist for their widespread implementation. Overcoming these barriers is a challenge that requires awareness and learning on the part of staff and administration regarding the impact of an unfriendly communicative environment on social isolation, and the resulting psychosocial consequences. Learning theory indicates that new learning in adults is motivated by connections between personal experiences and the material to be learned. Explicitly infusing established training programs with the experience of social isolation brought on by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic may be the key needed for changing the communicative environment in LTC.

AB  - Providing optimal care to patients with acute respiratory illness while preventing hospital transmission of COVID-19 is of paramount importance during the pandemic; the challenge lies in achieving both goals simultaneously. Controversy exists regarding the role of early intubation versus use of non-invasive respiratory support measures to avoid intubation. This review summarizes available evidence and provides a clinical decision algorithm with risk mitigation techniques to guide clinicians in care of the hypoxemic, non-intubated, patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although aerosolization of droplets may occur with aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP), including high flow nasal oxygen and non-invasive ventilation, the risk of using these AGMP is outweighed by the benefit in carefully selected patients, particularly if care is taken to mitigate risk of viral transmission. Non-invasive support measures should not be denied for conditions where previously proven effective and may be used even while there is suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Patients with de novo acute respiratory illness with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 may also benefit. These techniques may improve oxygenation sufficiently to allow some patients to avoid intubation; however, patients must be carefully monitored for signs of increased work of breathing. Patients showing signs of clinical deterioration or high work of breathing not alleviated by non-invasive support should proceed promptly to intubation and invasive lung protective ventilation strategy. With adherence to these principles, risk of viral spread can be minimized.

AB  - Severe virus outbreaks are occurring more often and spreading faster and further than ever. Preparedness plans based on lessons learned from past epidemics can guide behavioral and pharmacological interventions to contain and treat emergent diseases. Although conventional biologics production systems can meet the pharmaceutical needs of a community at homeostasis, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an abrupt rise in demand for vaccines and therapeutics that highlight the gaps in this supply chain's ability to quickly develop and produce biologics in emergency situations given a short lead time. Considering the projected requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and the necessity for expedited large scale manufacture the capabilities of current biologics production systems should be surveyed to determine their applicability to pandemic preparedness. Plant-based biologics production systems have progressed to a state of commercial viability in the past 30 years with the capacity for production of complex, glycosylated, "mammalian compatible" molecules in a system with comparatively low production costs, high scalability, and production flexibility. Continued research drives the expansion of plant virus-based tools for harnessing the full production capacity from the plant biomass in transient systems. Here, we present an overview of vaccine production systems with a focus on plant-based production systems and their potential role as "first responders" in emergency pandemic situations.

AB  - The progression of COVID-19 worldwide can be tracked by identifying mutations within the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that occur as a function of time. Such efforts currently rely on sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens (direct sequencing) or of virus isolated from patient specimens in cell cultures. A pilot SARS-CoV-2 air sampling study conducted at a clinic within a university student health care center detected the virus vRNA, with an estimated concentration of 0.87 virus genomes L-1 air. To determine whether the virus detected was viable ('live'), attempts were made to isolate the virus in cell cultures. Virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed within two days post-inoculation of Vero E6 cells with collection media from air samples; however, rtRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from cell culture were negative. Instead, three other fast-growing human respiratory viruses were isolated and subsequently identified, illustrating the challenge in isolating SARS-CoV-2 when multiple viruses are present in a test sample. The complete SAR-CoV-2 genomic sequence was nevertheless determined by Sanger sequencing and most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 genomes previously described in Georgia, USA. Results of this study illustrate the feasibility of tracking progression of the COVID-19 pandemic using environmental aerosol samples instead of human specimens. Collection of a positive sample from a distance more than 2 m away from the nearest patient traffic implies the virus was in an aerosol.

AB  - Distinctive patterns in the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been recently reported. We conducted a systematic review to identify case reports and case series characterizing cutaneous manifestations of confirmed COVID-19. Key demographic and clinical data from each case were extracted and analyzed. The primary outcome measure was risk factor analysis of skin related outcomes for severe COVID-19 disease. Seventy-one case reports and series comprising 144 cases of cutaneous involvement in COVID-19 were included. The most frequently occurring morphologies were: morbilliform (30.6%), varicelliform (18.8%), urticarial (13.2%), chilblains-like (12.5%), and acro-ischemic (9%). The median age of patients was 51 years (mean: 45.9, range: 0 to 91). Patients with chilblains-like eruptions had lower frequencies of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (5/18, 27.8%, P&lt;0.05) and were less likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (2/18, 11%, 95% CI 1.4% to 34.7%, P=0.02). Patients with livedoid and acro-ischemic morphologies had severe COVID-19 more frequently than those with other morphologies (17/21, 81%, 95% CI 58.0% to 94.5%, P&lt;0.0001). The most frequently observed cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 (morbilliform, varicelliform, and urticarial) are well-described patterns of viral exanthems. However, chilblains-like, livedoid, and acro-ischemic morphologies are not traditionally associated with viral infections and were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Developing optimal T-cell response assays to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for measuring the duration of immunity to this disease and assessing the efficacy of vaccine candidates. These assays need to target conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 global variants and avoid cross-reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses. To contribute to this effort, we employed an in-silico immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to identify immunogenic peptides resulting from conserved and highly networked regions with topological importance from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. A total of 57 highly networked T-cell epitopes that are conserved across geographic viral variants were identified from these viral proteins, with a binding potential to diverse HLA alleles and 80-100% global population coverage. Importantly, 18 of these T-cell epitope derived peptides had limited homology to seasonal human coronaviruses making them promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell immunity assays. Moreover, two of the NC-derived peptides elicited effector/polyfunctional responses of CD8+ T-cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients.ImportanceThe development of specific and validated immunologic tools is critical for understanding the level and duration of the cellular response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccines against this novel coronavirus disease. To contribute to this effort, we employed an immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to define 57 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides within topologically important regions of the nucleocapsid (NC) and spike (S) proteins that will be effective for detecting cellular immune responses in 80-100% of the global population. Our immunoinformatics analysis revealed that 18 of these peptides had limited homology to circulating seasonal human coronaviruses, and therefore are promising candidates for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 specific immune responses from pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Importantly, CD8+ T-cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited polyfunctional effector responses to two novel NC-derived peptides identified as HLA-binders. These studies provide a proof of concept that our immunoinformatics analysis pipeline identifies novel immunogens which can elicit polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses.

AB  - Unexpected viral infections outbreaks, significantly affect human health, leading to increased mortality and life disruption. Among them is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged as a deadly pandemic, calling for intense research efforts on its pathogenicity mechanism and development of therapeutic strategies. In the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm, systemic inflammation has been associated with severe illness and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated special pro-resolving lipids mediators (SPMs) lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, and protectins as potential therapeutic options for abnormal viral-triggered inflammation. Pro-resolving lipids mediators have shown great promise for the treatment of Herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus. Based on this, studies are being conducted on their therapeutic effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we discussed SPMs and reviewed evidence from recent studies on SPMs as therapeutic options for viral infections, including SARS-CoV2. Based on our analysis of the previous study, we argue that SPMs are a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viral infections. We expect further research on how SPMs modulate viral-triggered inflammation through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and chemical stability and druggability of SPMs.

AB  - The novel beta coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, designated as COVID-19) that is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome has devastated the global economy and health care system. Since COVID-19 changed the definition of "normal" in ordinary life around the world, the development of effective therapeutics and preventive measures is desperately needed to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection and restore normalcy. A clear understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is crucial in providing the scientific rationale necessary to develop anti-COVID19 drugs and vaccines. According to the most recently published literature, COVID-19 pathogenesis was postulated to occur in three sequential phases: pulmonary, proinflammatory, and prothrombic. Herein, virus-host interactions, potential pathogenic mechanisms, and clinical manifestations are described for each phase. Additionally, based on this pathogenesis model, various therapeutic strategies involving current clinical trials are presented with an explanation of their modes of action and example drugs. This review is a thorough, updated summary of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the therapeutic options available for this disease.

AB  - In this indefinite pandemic situation, roles of nurses have been most illuminated by the public, but the nurses may soon start experiencing burnout. This paper highlights roles of nurses in COVID care in Korea and nursing strategies for the post-COVID era. As we are the frontline advocators of the public, when we develop strategies for their health and quality of life, we receive public support that can help resolve our issues. We will improve our poor working environments through mutual cooperation, as we are one. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses need to possess a variety of abilities, such as the digital literacy required by the non-contact era after COVID-19, and to expand the boundaries of the nursing profession in convergence of health services with technology.

AB  - Background: Understanding the association between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and coagulopathy may assist clinical prognostication, and influence treatment and outcomes. We aimed to systematically describe the relationship between hemostatic laboratory parameters and important clinical outcomes among adults with COVID-19. Methods: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials, observational studies and case series published in PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and CENTRAL from December 1, 2019 to March 25, 2020. Studies of adult patients with COVID-19 that reported at least one hemostatic laboratory parameter were included. Results: Data were extracted from 57 studies (N=12,050 patients) that met inclusion criteria. The average age of patients was 52 years and 45% were women. Of the included studies, 92.7% (N=38/41 studies) reported an average platelet count greater than or equal to 150 x 109/L, 68.2% (N=15/22 studies) reported an average prothrombin time (PT) between 11-14 s, 55% (N=11/20 studies) reported an average activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) between 25-35 s, and 34.4% (N=11/32 studies) reported a D-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Eight studies (7 cohorts and 1 case series) reported hemostatic lab values for survivors versus non-survivors. Among non-survivors, D-dimer concentrations were reported in 4 studies and all reported an average above the ULN. Interpretation: Most patients had a normal platelet count, elevated D-dimer, PT and aPTT values in the upper reference interval; D-dimer elevation appeared to correlate with poor outcomes. Further studies are needed to better correlate these hemostatic parameters with the risk of adverse outcomes such as thrombosis and bleeding.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Emerging evidence has underscored the potential usefulness of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) measurement in predicting the mortality and disease severity of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences=0.72; 95% CI=.47-0.97; I2 =89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to survived patients (mean differences=0.93; 95% CI=0.63-1.23; I2 =85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences=0.61; 95% CI=0.28-0.94; I2 =82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.

AB  - At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, sales of nonperishable food drastically increased in Germany. Reports of hoarding and panic buying flooded the media. To identify the drivers of the increased sales of these products, we carried out an online survey with n=495 people living in Germany. We followed a concurrent triangulation design. For the quantitative analysis, we extended the theory of planned behavior to identify possible reasons for stockpiling nonperishable food. The results suggest that "attitude," "subjective norm," and the "fear of future unavailability" were main drivers of stockpiling behavior in our sample. Additionally, we analyzed answers to open questions capturing participants' own explanations of why they did or did not stockpile nonperishable food. By contrasting the results, we found that our qualitative results validate some of our quantitative findings but also deliver new insights. For instance, a key stated reason for stockpiling nonperishable food was to reduce shopping frequency.

AB  - Health systems worldwide are challenged by the coronavirus pandemic and all medical specialties have struggle to meet the conflicting requirements for virus containment on the one hand and treatment of other medical conditions on the other. This holds true also for psychiatry. Per se, psychiatric patients are highly vulnerable to suffer from social isolation and loneliness. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown measures, unfortunately, this vulnerability is even further increased. As a part of its pandemic risk management, the outpatient clinic of the Psychiatric District Hospital Regensburg launched an online blog as a means of assisting patients who were required to stay home. Aim of the blog was to stay by patients' side in those uncertain times by offering an online connection to their therapists, by providing important information about the pandemic situation, by offering some ideas on how to build a daily routine and how to meaningfully spend their time at home during the lockdown. We also aimed at involving patients as experts in their own affairs by inviting them to contribute to the blog's shape and content. As a result of coordinated team effort, it was possible to launch a blog within few days, and this was perceived helpful by many patients. Overall, however, patient involvement turned out to be a challenge requiring more attention in future work.

AB  - The timing of transmission plays a key role in the dynamics and controllability of an epidemic. However, observing generation times-the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair-requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals-the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period-the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual-distributions. These two approaches make different-and not always explicitly stated-assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.

AB  - As COVID-19 vaccines become available, supply is expected to initially fall short of demand. In response, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued guidance on which groups should be prioritized to receive vaccines. For the first phase of vaccine allocation, the ACIP recommended healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents as recipients. This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID-19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities. Finally, because present-day COVID-19 vulnerabilities in these workers have been shaped by unjust policies over the past several decades, and because COVID-19 public health policies have excluded and potentially exacerbated the impacts of the pandemic for these workers, allocating vaccines to commercial truck drivers is a necessary step toward promoting justice.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required transplant nephrologists, surgeons, and care teams to make decisions about the full spectrum of transplant program operations and clinical practices, in the absence of experience or data. Initially, across the country, there was a reduction in kidney transplant procedures, and a striking pause in the conduct of living donation and living donor transplant surgeries. Aspects of candidate evaluation and follow-up rapidly converted to telehealth. Months into the pandemic, much has been learned from experiences world-wide, yet many questions remain. In this Perspective, we reflect on some of the practice decisions made by the transplant community in the initial response to the pandemic, and consider lessons learned, including related to the risks, benefits, and logistical considerations of proceeding with versus delaying deceased donor transplantation, living donation, and living donor transplantation during the pandemic. We review the evolution of therapeutic strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their use in transplant recipients, current consensus related to immunosuppression management in infected transplant recipients, and emerging information on vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. We share our thoughts on research priorities, discuss the areas in which we are still practicing with uncertainty, and look ahead to the next phase of the pandemic response.

AB  - Aberrant T cell differentiation and lymphopenia are hallmarks of severe COVID-19 disease. Since T cells must race to cull infected cells, they are quick to differentiate and achieve cytotoxic function. With this responsiveness, comes hastened apoptosis, due to a coupled mechanism of death and differentiation in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes via CD95 (Fas) and serine-threonine kinase (Akt). T cell lymphopenia in severe cases may represent cell death or peripheral migration. These facets depict SARS-Cov-2 as a lympho-manipulative pathogen; it distorts T cell function, numbers, and death, and creates a dysfunctional immune response. Whether preservation of T cells, prevention of their aberrant differentiation, and expansion of their population may alter disease course is unknown. Its investigation requires experimental interrogation of the linked differentiation and death pathway by agents known to uncouple T cell proliferation and differentiation in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

AB  - Managing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requires paramedics to perform multiple aerosol generating medical procedures in an uncontrolled setting. This increases the risk of cross infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Modifications to conventional protocols are required to balance paramedic safety with optimal patient care and potential stresses on the capacity of critical care resources. Despite this, little specific advice has been published to guide paramedic practice. In this commentary, we highlight challenges and controversies regarding critical decision making around initiation of resuscitation, airway management, mechanical chest compression, and termination of resuscitation. We also discuss suggested triggers for implementation and revocation of recommended protocol changes and present an accompanying paramedic-specific algorithm.

AB  - Bats are often claimed to be a major source for future viral epidemics, as they are associated with several viruses with zoonotic potential. Here we describe the presence and biodiversity of bats associated with intensive pig farms devoted to the production of heavy pigs in northern Italy. Since chiropters or signs of their presence were not found within animal shelters in our study area, we suggest that fecal viruses with high environmental resistance have the highest likelihood for spillover through indirect transmission. In turn, we investigated the circulation of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), coronaviruses (CoVs) and astroviruses (AstVs) in pigs and bats sharing the same environment. Results of our preliminary study did not show any bat virus in pigs suggesting that spillover from these animals is rare. However, several AstVs, CoVs and MRVs circulated undetected in pigs. Among those, one MRV was a reassortant strain carrying viral genes likely acquired from bats. On the other hand, we found a swine AstV and a MRV strain carrying swine genes in bat guano, indicating that viral exchange at the bat-pig interface might occur more frequently from pigs to bats rather than the other way around. Considering the indoor farming system as the most common system in the European Union (EU), preventive measures should focus on biosecurity rather than displacement of bats, which are protected throughout the EU and provide critical ecosystem services for rural settings.

AB  - Introduction The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to disrupt health systems worldwide, leading to population lockdowns in many countries. Preventing hospitalisation, death and long-COVID-19 with repurposed drugs remains a priority. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are the most commonly used in ambulatory care, with divergent results. With the aim of decentralizing early treatment to family practitioners, we addressed the question: Can early home treatment with AZM alone or with zinc help prevent hospitalisation, death, and long-COVID-19? Methodology We conducted a scoping review of articles published from 31st December 2019 to 5th November 2020 in Pubmed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv databases, and a review of undergoing clinical trials published in the Clinicaltrial.gov database. Results Many studies report on outpatient treatment with a combination of AZM + HCQ versus AZM alone, and few studies propose the addition of Zinc (Zn) to AZM. In addition, we identified 5 clinical trials currently recruiting individuals for early outpatient treatment with AZM. However, we failed in identifying any study or clinical trial conducted with family practitioners responding to our question. Discussion The antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory benefits of AZM + Zn make this drugs combination a good candidate therapy to treat flu-like-COVID-19 and atypical pneumoniae. The antibacterial action of AZM can also help disrupting the bacteria/virus cooperation that is poorly documented. Considering pros and cons of macrolide use (including antimicrobial resistance), we call for early use of this therapy by family practitioners for home treatment of individuals presenting mild or moderate symptoms under rigorous scientific guidance to prevent hospitalisation, death and long-COVID.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding receivedAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No need to request approval from ethics committeeAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic urged both scientific community and health care companies to undertake an unprecedented effort with the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing effective therapeutic solutions. The peculiar immune response triggered by such virus, that seems to last only few months, induced to look for alternatives such as passive immunization in addition to conventional vaccinations. Convalescent sera, monoclonal antibodies selected among the most potent neutralizing binders induced by the virus infection, recombinant human single-domain antibodies and binders of variable scaffold and different origin have been tested alone or in combination exploiting mono and multivalent/multispecific formats. In this review we analyze the state of the advancement of the research in this field and present a summary of the ongoing projects finalized to identify suitable molecules for therapies based on passive immunization.

AB  - The objective of this short scientific communication is to describe and test a strategy to overcome communication barriers in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era otolaryngology operating rooms. Thirteen endoscopic sinus surgeries, 4 skull base surgeries, and 1 tracheotomy were performed with powered air-purifying respirators. During these surgeries, surgical team members donned headsets with microphones linked via conference call. Noise measurements and survey responses were obtained and compared to pre-COVID-19 data. Noise was problematic and caused miscommunication as per 93% and 76% of respondents, respectively. Noise in COVID-19 era operating rooms was significantly higher compared to pre-COVID-19 era data (73.8 vs 70.2 decibels, P = .04). Implementation of this headset strategy significantly improved communication. Respondents with headsets were less likely to encounter communication problems (31% vs 93%, P < .001). Intraoperative measures to protect surgical team members during aerosolizing surgeries may impair communication. Linking team members via a conference call is a solution to improve communication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Populations such as healthcare workers (HCW) that are unable to practice physical distancing are at high risk of acquiring Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In these cases pharmacological prophylaxis would be a solution to reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) transmission. Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro antiviral properties against SARS CoV-2. We therefore sought to determine the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis for COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We electronically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane COVID-19 Register of Controlled Trials, Epistemonikos COVID-19, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to September 28th, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effect model. We identified four RCTs (n = 4921) that met our eligibility criteria. The use of hydroxychloroquine, compared to placebo, did not reduce the risks of developing COVID-19 (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.04, moderate certainty), hospitalization (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.50, moderate certainty), or mortality (RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 79.74, low certainty), however, hydroxychloroquine use increased the risk of adverse events (RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.55, moderate certainty). CONCLUSION: Although pharmacologic prophylaxis is an attractive preventive strategy against COVID-19, the current body of evidence failed to show clinical benefit for prophylactic hydroxychloroquine and showed a higher risk of adverse events when compared to placebo or no prophylaxis.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised a grave concern and a severe global health burden. Since no effective drugs have been approved for satisfactory prevention and treatment, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has attracted global attention. To date, a large number of COVID-19 vaccines are being rapidly developed worldwide, with thirteen candidates in Phase 3 trials, 52 tested in clinical trials, and 162 in preclinical evaluation. Here, we summarize the latest progress of all 13 COVID-19 vaccines in Phase 3 trails. Furthermore, some vaccines have received approval or emergency use approvals. We focus on the potential issues related to vaccination including vaccine acceptance, vaccine promotion, and vaccine distribution.

AB  - Wearing face masks has become the new normal worldwide due to the global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019. The inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks has rarely been reported. The present study used different types of commonly used masks to conduct breathing simulation experiments and investigate microplastic inhalation risk. Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint. Wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the world and is negatively impacting the global human population. COVID-19 patients display a wide variety of symptoms and clinical outcomes, including those attributed to genetic ancestry. Alu retrotransposons have played an important role in human evolution, and their variants influence host response to viral infection. Intronic Alus regulate gene expression through several mechanisms, including both genetic and epigenetic pathways. With respect to SARS-CoV-2, an intronic Alu within the ACE gene is hypothesized to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and morbidity. Here, we review specific Alu polymorphisms that are of particular interest when considering host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially polymorphic Alu insertions in genes associated with immune response and coagulation/fibrinolysis cascade. We posit that additional research focused on Alu-related pathways could yield novel biomarkers capable of predicting clinical outcomes as well as patient-specific treatment strategies for COVID-19 and related infectious diseases.

AB  - Infectious diseases have caused some of the most feared plagues and greatly harmed human health. However, despite the qualitative understanding that the occurrence and diffusion of infectious disease is related to the environment, the quantitative relations are unknown for many diseases. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that poses a fatal threat and has spread explosively throughout the world, impacting human health. From a geographical perspective, this study aims to understand the global hotspots of ZIKV as well as the spatially heterogeneous relationship between ZIKV and environmental factors using exploratory special data analysis (ESDA) model. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to analyze the influence of the dominant environmental factors on the spread of ZIKV at the continental scale. The results indicated that ZIKV transmission had obvious regional and seasonal heterogeneity. Population density, GDP per capita, and landscape fragmentation were the dominant environmental factors affecting the spread of ZIKV, which indicates that social factors had a greater influence than natural factors on the spread of it. As SARS-CoV-2 is spreading globally, this study can provide methodological reference for fighting against the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over 10 million people globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or therapy for treatment thus far. After affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling pathways of host cells play critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells. Drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially effective for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel integrative analysis approach to identify the related molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and repurposed drugs as potentially effective treatments for COVID-19, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. RESULTS: We identified activated signaling pathways associated with the infection caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through integrative analysis. Then, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super GOs were identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT, IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly activated. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and reverse gene expression data resources. In addition to many drugs being evaluated in clinical trials, the dexamethasone was top-ranked in the prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: The integrative genomics data analysis and results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - Covid-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands deaths and millions of infections and continued spreading violently. Although researchers are racing to find or develop effective drugs or vaccines, no drugs from modern medical system have been proven effective and the high mutant rates of the virus may lead it resistant to whatever drugs or vaccines developed following modern drug development procedure. Current evidence has demonstrated impressive healing effects of several Chinese medicines (CMs) for Covid-19, which urges us to reflect on the role of CM in the era of modern medicine. Undoubtedly, CM could be promising resources for developing drug candidates for the treatment of Covid-19 in a way similar to the development of artemisinin. But the theory that builds CM, like the emphasis of driving away exogenous pathogen (virus, etc.) by restoring self-healing capacity rather than killing the pathogen directly from the inside and the 'black-box' mode of diagnosing and treating patients, is as important, yet often ignored, an treasure as CM herbs and should be incorporated into modern medicine for future advancement and innovation of medical science.

AB  - Antiviral therapies targeting the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently required. We studied an already-approved botanical drug cepharanthine (CEP) in a cell culture model of GX_P2V, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related virus. RNA-sequencing results showed the virus perturbed the expression of multiple genes including those associated with cellular stress responses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated heat shock response, of which heat shock response-related genes and pathways were at the core. CEP was potent to reverse most dysregulated genes and pathways in infected cells including ER stress/unfolded protein response and HSF1-mediated heat shock response. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomes also confirmed that genes of cellular stress responses and autophagy pathways were enriched in several peripheral blood mononuclear cells populations from COVID-19 patients. In summary, this study uncovered the transcriptome of a SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus infection model and anti-viral activities of CEP, providing evidence for CEP as a promising therapeutic option for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally since its first report and become a worldwide pandemic. In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, Center for Medical Device Evaluation, NMPA (CMDE) initiated emergency review and approval procedures to accelerate the process of reviewing emergent medical products and issued the Key Points of Technical Review for the Registration of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen/Antibody Tests (Key Points) to provide the requirements on the technical review of the tests. With uncontrolled spread and evolution of COVID-19 in the world, continuous prevention and measurements are necessary for fighting this pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 antigen/antibody tests are still urgently needed. This article is an attempt to expand clarification of the Key Points to wider audiences based on current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate the development and application of SARS-CoV-2 antigen/antibody tests.

AB  - COVID-19 has broken out rapidly in nearly all countries worldwide, and has blossomed into a pandemic. Since the beginning of the spread of COVID-19, many scientists have been cooperating to study a vast array of old drugs and new clinical trial drugs to discover potent drugs with anti-COVID-19 activity, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, immunosuppressants, Chinese medicines, Mpro inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, etc. The most commonly used drugs are antiviral compounds, antimalarial drugs and JAK inhibitors. In this review, we summarize mainly the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the antiviral drugs Favipiravir and Remdesivir, and JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib, discussing their biological activities, clinical trials and synthesis progress.

AB  - The World Health Organization declared the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic on March 12, 2020. However, inadequate attention seems to have been paid to the heart when managing COVID-19 in terms of detection, monitoring and treatment. We are of the opinion that these severe patients may have had myocardial injury or acute myocarditis. Signs that supports this opinion is the extremely high myocardial injury markers in severe patients, cardiac arrhythmia and suffer progressive heart failure or unexpected cardiac arrest in recent studies. Some suggestions involved of treatment need to be made. The use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be placed earlier if the pneumonia progresses rapidly, the ejection fraction decreases or there is heart failure. Besides, blood purification treatment including continuous kidney substitution treatment (CRRT) is recommended to clear inflammatory factors and block cytokine storm. In addition, the early usage of glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin has been found to be preferable when acute myocarditis is accompanied by unstable hemodynamics.

AB  - A robust testing program is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 infections before a vaccine becomes available. However, due to an acute shortage of testing kits (especially in low-resource developing countries), designing an optimal testing program/strategy is a challenging problem to solve. Prior literature on testing strategies suffers from two major limitations: (i) it does not account for the trade-off between testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and (ii) it primarily focuses on static testing strategies, which leads to significant shortcomings in the testing program’s effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations by making five novel contributions. (i) We formally define the optimal testing problem and propose the DOCTOR POMDP model to tackle it. (ii) We solve the DOCTOR POMDP using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search based algorithm. (iii) We provide a rigorous experimental analysis of DOCTOR’s testing strategies against static baselines - our results show that when applied to the city of Santiago in Panama, DOCTOR’s strategies result in ∼40% fewer COVID-19 infections (over one month) as compared to state-of-the-art static baselines. (iv) In addition, we analyze DOCTOR’s testing policy to derive insights about the reasons behind the optimality of DOCTOR’s testing policy. (v) Finally, we characterize conditions (of the real world) under which DOCTOR’s optimization would be of most benefit to government policy makers, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area. Our work complements the growing body of research on COVID-19, and serves as a proof-of-concept that illustrates the benefit of having an AI-driven adaptive testing strategy for COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThis paper is not related to clinical study.Funding StatementNo funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:No approval needed.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic posing significant health risks. The diagnostic test sensitivity of COVID-19 is limited due to irregularities in specimen handling. We propose a deep learning framework that identifies COVID-19 from medical images as an auxiliary testing method to improve diagnostic sensitivity. We use pseudo-coloring methods and a platform for annotating X-ray and computed tomography images to train the convolutional neural network, which achieves a performance similar to that of experts and provides high scores for multiple statistical indices (F1 scores > 96.72% (0.9307, 0.9890) and specificity >99.33% (0.9792, 1.0000)). Heatmaps are used to visualize the salient features extracted by the neural network. The neural network-based regression provides strong correlations between the lesion areas in the images and five clinical indicators, resulting in high accuracy of the classification framework. The proposed method represents a potential computer-aided diagnosis method for COVID-19 in clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still developing worldwide. The prognosis of the disease will become worse and mortality will be even higher when it is combined with cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, COVID-19 is highly infectious and requires strict isolation measures. For acute coronary syndromes (ACS), a common cardiovascular disease, infection may aggravate the occurrence and development of ACS, making the management of more difficult. It will be an enormous challenge for clinical practice to deal with ACS in this setting of COVID-19.Aim to reduce the mortality of ACS patients during the epidemic of COVID-19 by standardizing procedures as much as possible.Pubmed and other relevant databases were searched to retrieve articles on COVID-19 and articles on ACS management strategies during previous influenza epidemics. The data was described and synthesized to summarize the diagnosis and management strategy of ACS, the preparation of catheter laboratory, and the protection of the medical staff in the context of COVID-19. Ethical approval is not required in this study, because it is a review with no recourse to patient identifiable information.Standardized diagnosis and treatment advice can help reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients with ACS. In the absence of contraindications, the third generation of thrombolytic drugs should be the first choice for thrombolytic treatment in the isolation ward. For patients who have to receive PCI, this article provides detailed protective measures to avoid nosocomial infection.

AB  - The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the newly discovered virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had been noticed to have high morbidity and mortality. Apart from pneumonia, COVID-19 can also cause damage to the cardiovascular system, and co-occurring with cardiovascular injury leads to a poorer prognosis. Besides, amid the pandemic of COVID-19, the management of critical cardiovascular events needs to further account for the highly infectious coronavirus, prompt and optimal treatments, clinician's safety, and healthcare provider's capacity. This review article aims to provide more comprehensive and appropriate guidance for the management of critical cardiovascular disease, including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and advanced care planning, during the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - This article investigates the lawfulness of isolating residents of care and group homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many residents are mobile, and their freedom to move is a central ethical tenet and human right. It is not however an absolute right and trade-offs between autonomy, liberty and health need to be made since COVID-19 is highly infectious and poses serious risks of critical illness and death. People living in care and group homes may be particularly vulnerable because recommended hygiene practices are difficult for them and many residents are elderly, and/or have co-morbidities. In some circumstances, the trade-offs can be made easily with the agreement of the resident and for short periods of time. However challenging cases arise, in particular for residents and occupants with dementia who 'wander', meaning they have a strong need to walk, sometimes due to agitation, as may also be the case for some people with developmental disability (e.g. autism), or as a consequence of mental illness. This article addresses three central questions: (1) in what circumstances is it lawful to isolate residents of social care homes to prevent transmission of COVID-19, in particular where the resident has a strong compulsion to walk and will not, or cannot, remain still and isolated? (2) what types of strategies are lawful to curtail walking and achieve isolation and social distancing? (3) is law reform required to ensure any action to restrict freedoms is lawful and not excessive? These questions emerged during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and are still relevant. Although focussed on COVID-19, the results are also relevant to other future outbreaks of infectious diseases in care and group homes. Likewise, while we concentrate on the law in England and Wales, the analysis and implications have international significance.

AB  - Introduction: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed evaluate the 30-day mortality, number and site of fracture, mechanism of injury, and location where injury was sustained during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase on original articles, research letters, and short reports which have data about the number of fractures, site of fracture, mechanism of injury, location where injury was sustained, percentage of operative intervention, mortality during the pandemic compared to a specified period of time before the pandemic. The search was finalized in October 14, 2020. Results: A total of 11,936 participants from 16 studies were included in our study. The pooled analysis indicated a higher 30-days mortality associated with fractures during the pandemic (9% vs 4%, OR 1.86 [1.05, 3.27], p = 0.03; I2: 36%, p = 0.15). The number of fractures presenting to hospitals has declined 43% (35-50%) compared to pre-pandemic. Hand fracture was fewer during the pandemic (18% vs 23%, OR 0.75 [0.58, 0.97], p = 0.03; I2: 69%, p = 0.002). Work-related traumas, high-energy falls, and domestic accidents were more common during the pandemic, while sports-related traumas were found to be less. Injuries that occurred in the sports area were lower than before the pandemic. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of fractures has decreased, but there is a higher mortality rate associated with fractures.

AB  - The worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still in progress, but much remains unknown about the disease. In this article, we review the association of hypertension or the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with COVID-19 and the correlation between electrolyte disorders and disease severity. Underlying hypertension is likely to be associated with severe or critical COVID-19, but the relationship is not clear owing to confounding factors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in the non-classical RAS pathway and binds to a receptor binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The RAS blockade is known to increase ACE2 levels, but controversy remains regarding the effect of RAS blockade therapy in the course of COVID-19. Some reports have indicated a protective effect of RAS blockade on COVID-19, whereas others have reported an association of RAS blockade therapy with the occurrence of severe complications such as acute kidney injury and admission to the intensive care unit. Electrolyte disorders are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 has frequently shown hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia. Electrolyte imbalances are caused by alteration of RAS, gastrointestinal loss, effects of proinflammatory cytokines, and renal tubular dysfunction by the invasion of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background: With nearly 400 000 migrant workers in Singapore, many from Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, language and cultural barriers posed a great many challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was especially so as majority of the COVID-19 clusters in Singapore emerged from their communal dormitories. With concerns arising as to how this minority group could be best cared for in the intensive care units, the need for medical interpreters became clear. Main: In response, the Communication and Supportive Care (CSC) workgroup at the Singapore General Hospital developed the 'Medical Interpreters Training for ICU Conversations' program. Led by a medical social worker-cum-ethicist and 2 palliative care physicians, twenty volunteers underwent training. The program comprised of 4 parts. Firstly, volunteers were provided with an overview of challenges within the COVID-19 isolation ICU environment. Discussed in detail were common issues between patients and families, forms of distress faced by healthcare workers, family communication modality protocols, and the sociocultural demographics of Singapore's migrant worker population. Secondly, key practice principles and 'Do's/Don'ts' in line with the ethical principles of medical interpretation identified by the California Healthcare Interpreters Association were shared. Thirdly, practical steps to consider before, during and at the end of each interpretation session were foregrounded. Lastly, a focus group discussion on the complexities of ICU cases and their attending issues was conducted. Targeted support was further provided in response to participant feedback and specific issues raised. Conclusion: As a testament to its efficacy, the program has since been extended to the general wards and the Ministry of Health in Singapore has further commissioned similar programs in various hospitals. In-depth training on the fundamentals of medical terminology, language and cultural competency should be provided to all pertinent healthcare workers and hospitals should consider hiring medical interpreters in permanent positions.

AB  - The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents the greatest worldwide public health crisis of recent times. The lack of proven effective therapies means that COVID-19 rages relatively unchecked. Current anti-COVID-19 pharmacotherapies are drugs originally designed for other diseases, and administered orally or intravascularly. Thus, they can have various adverse effects. A specific anti-COronavirus drug should not only target the virus per se, but also treat the related respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms. Here, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of current anti-COVID-19 pharmacotherapies, and analyze the reasons why in the era of big data we have not yet established specific coronavirus therapies and related technical bottlenecks. Finally, we present our design of a novel nebulized S-nitrosocaptopril that is under development for targeting both coronaviruses and their related symptoms.

AB  - While COVID-19 continues raging worldwide, effective vaccines are highly anticipated. However, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. Survey results on uptake intentions vary and continue to change. This review compared trends and synthesized findings in vaccination receptivity over time across US and international polls, assessing survey design influences and evaluating context to inform policies and practices. Data sources included academic literature (PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO following PRISMA guidelines), news and official reports published by 20 October 2020. Two researchers independently screened potential peer-reviewed articles and syndicated polls for eligibility; 126 studies and surveys were selected. Declining vaccine acceptance (from >70% in March to <50% in October) with demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan divides was observed. Perceived risk, concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness, doctors' recommendations, and inoculation history were common factors. Impacts of regional infection rates, gender, and personal COVID-19 experience were inconclusive. Unique COVID-19 factors included political party orientation, doubts toward expedited development/approval process, and perceived political interference. Many receptive participants preferred to wait until others have taken the vaccine; mandates could increase resistance. Survey wording and answer options showed influence on responses. To achieve herd immunity, communication campaigns are immediately needed, focusing on transparency and restoring trust in health authorities.

AB  - COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel β-coronavirus, belonging to the same subgenus as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. Remdesivir, an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral agent has previously demonstrated in vitro activity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and in vivo efficacy against other related coronaviruses in animal models. Its safety profile has been tested in a compassionate use setting for patients with COVID-19. The current therapeutic studies demonstrate clinical effectiveness of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients by shortening time to clinical recovery, and hospital stay. In this review, we critically analyze the current evidence of remdesivir against COVID-19 and dissect the aspects over its safety and efficacy. Based on existing data, remdesivir can be regarded as a potential therapeutic agent against COVID-19. Further large-scale, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials are, however, awaited to validate these findings.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In China, Yinqiao powder is widely used to prevent and treat COVID-19 patients with Weifen syndrome. In this study, the screening and verification of active ingredients, target selection and DisGeNET scoring, drug-ingredient-gene network construction, protein-protein interaction network construction, molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, gene ontology (GO) functional analysis, gene tissue analysis, and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to explore the active ingredients, targets, and potential mechanisms of Yinqiao powder in the treatment of COVID-19. We also predicted the therapeutic effect of Yinqiao powder using TCM anti-COVID-19 (TCMATCOV). Yinqiao powder has a certain therapeutic effect on COVID-19, with an intervention score of 20.16. Hesperetin, eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin, and naringenin were the potentially effective active ingredients against COVID-19. The hub-proteins were interleukin-6 (IL-6), mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and tumor protein P53 (TP53). The potential mechanisms of Yinqiao powder in the treatment of COVID-19 are the TNF signaling pathway, T-cell receptor signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. This study provides a new perspective for discovering potential drugs and mechanisms of COVID-19.

AB  - The spreading of infectious diseases including COVID-19 depends on human interactions. In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here, we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows a maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of [Formula: see text] days. Our findings suggest that trends in local mobility allow us to forecast the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 for a window of two weeks and adjust local control strategies in real time.

AB  - Patients with the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been frequently found to suffer from both arterial and venous thrombotic events due to the perpetuation of a hypercoagulable state. This phenomenon, termed COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, is now considered a major component of the pathophysiology of this novel infectious disease, leading to widespread thrombosis. While at first, the vascular insults may be limited to the pulmonary microvasculature, as the disease progresses, systemic involvement occurs, culminating in distant organ thrombosis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. In this review article, we discuss recent insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and review the clinical, histopathologic, and laboratory evidence, which leads us to conclude that COVID-19 is both a pulmonary and vascular disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has becoming a public health issue since March 2020 considering that more than 30 million people were found to be infected worldwide. Particularly, recent evidences suggested that men may be considered as at higher risk of poor prognosis or death once the infection occurred and concerns surfaced in regard of the risk of a possible testicular injury due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Several data support the existence of a bivalent role of testosterone (T) in driving poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On one hand, this is attributable to the fact that T may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells by means of an enhanced expression of transmembrane serine-protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At the same time, younger man with normal testicular function compared to women of similar age are prone to develop a blunted immune response against SARS-CoV-2, being exposed to less viral clearance and more viral shedding and systemic spread of the disease. Conversely, low levels of serum T observed in hypogonadal men predispose them to a greater background systemic inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and immune system dysfunction, hence driving harmful consequences once SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Finally, SARS-CoV-2, as a systemic disease, may also affect testicles with possible concerns for current and future testicular efficiency. Preliminary data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 genome is not normally found in gonads and gametes, therefore sex transmission could be excluded as a possible way to spread the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most data support a role of T as a bivalent risk factor for poor prognosis (high/normal in younger; lower in elderly) in COVID-19. However, the impact of medical treatment aimed to modify T homeostasis for improving the prognosis of affected patients is unknown in this clinical setting. In addition, testicular damage may be a harmful consequence of the infection even in case it occurred asymptomatically but no long-term evidences are currently available to confirm and quantify this phenomenon. Different authors excluded the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm and oocytes, thus limiting worries about both a potential sexual and gamete-to-embryos transmission of COVID-19. Despite these evidence, long-term and well-designed studies are needed to clarify these issues.

AB  - PURPOSE: In Italy, colorectal surgery has been strongly affected with the vast majority (90%) of operations treating benign diseases, with an estimated overall 12-week cancellation rate of 72%. Little is known on how to best manage patients with benign diseases and the consequences this interruption of care will have in post-pandemic times. Proctologic diseases have social, psychological, and healthcare repercussions for their high incidence and great impact on the quality of life. METHODS: We decided to treated 10 urgent cases affected from III- and IV-degree hemorrhoids with 3% polidocanol foam in attempt to reduce hemorrhoidal symptoms while waiting for surgery so called "bridge treatment". RESULTS: During the follow-up no complications were occurred, and all patients had resolution of bleeding and pruritus with a mean VAS of 1 (range, 0-1). CONCLUSIONS: This treatment could reduce the bleeding that is the main symptom from which patients suffer and for which they underwent proctological evaluation and surgery. According to our preliminary experience in the impossibility of accessing the surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, ST could be considered as the treatment of choice in those patients who are suffering from grade III- and IV-degree hemorrhoids while waiting for surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The clinical syndrome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction is commonly seen in these patients, often presenting as clinical heart failure. Accordingly, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on COVID-19 myocarditis and its long-term heart failure sequelae. RECENT FINDINGS: Several suspected cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported. It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis. Several treatment strategies have been described, including both supportive and targeted therapies. SUMMARY: COVID-19 can cause a spectrum of ventricular dysfunction ranging from mild disease to fulminant myocarditis with hemodynamic instability. Future research is needed to understand the true prevalence of COVID-19 myocarditis, as well as to better define various diagnostic protocols and treatment strategies.

AB  - Background: It is widely perceived that COVID-19 has significant influence on higher education and also contribution to development including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However there is insufficient evidence about investigations on such influences, especially at micro level. Design and method: A university located in Wuhan, China, is selected for the case study to explore how COVID-19 affects higher education and how universities' coping strategies of COVID-19 can contribute to SDGs. The method is an analysis of 32 institutional documents published by the university. Results: The university in the case study has taken a number of coping strategies of COVID-19, largely in four aspects including medical services, online education, logistic support, and graduate employment promotion. These coping strategies contribute to achieving SDGs, especially SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10. Conclusions: The case study provides micro-level empirical evidence, which supports that appropriate university coping strategies of COVID-19 can contribute to SDGs, even it is widely perceived that the pandemic has brought strong negative impact on higher education and sustainable development. The selection of a university in Wuhan, China, can generate more practical implications, as Wuhan is the first city that experienced the unprecedented lockdown, and China is the first country that reopened university campuses after the lockdown.

AB  - The worldwide epidemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a strong demand for highly efficient immunobinding to achieve rapid and accurate on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, hour-scale time-consumption is usually required to ensure the adequacy of immunobinding on expensive large instruments in hospitals, and the common false negative or positive results often occur in rapid on-site immunoassay (e.g. immunochromatography). We solved this dilemma by presenting a reciprocating-flowing immunobinding (RF-immunobinding) strategy. RF-immunobinding enabled the antibodies in fluid contacting with the corresponding immobilized antigens on substrate repeatedly during continuous reciprocating-flowing, to achieve adequate immunobinding within 60 s. This strategy was further developed into an immunoassay method for the serological detection of 13 suspected COVID-19 patients. We obtained a 100% true negative and true positive rate and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.14 pg/mL. Our strategy also can be a potential support for other areas related to immunorecognition, such as proteomics, immunopharmacology and immunohistochemistry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current COVID pandemic is happening while the long-term effects of coronavirus infection remain poorly understood. The present article meta-analyzed mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, etc.) from a previous coronavirus outbreak in China (2002). METHOD: CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, and Google Scholar were searched up to early June 2020 for articles in English or Chinese reporting mental illness symptoms of SARS patients. Main outcome measures include SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and IES-R scales. 29 papers met the inclusion criteria. The longest follow-up time included in the analysis was 46 months. FINDINGS: The systematic meta-analysis indicated that mental health problems were most serious before or at hospital discharge and declined significantly during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, average symptom levels remained above healthy norms even at 12 months and continued to improve, albeit slowly, thereafter. INTERPRETATION: The adverse mental health impact of being hospitalized with coronavirus infection long outlasts the physical illness. Mental health issues were the most serious for coronavirus infected patients before (including) hospital discharge and improved continuously during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. If COVID-19 infected patients follow a similar course of mental health development, most patients should recover to normal after 12 months of hospital discharge.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, while healthcare systems and hospitals are diverting their resources to combat the pandemic, patients who require spinal surgeries continue to accumulate. The aim of this study is to describe a novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) to prioritize patients who require surgery during the "new normal state" of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: A consensus study using the Delphi technique was carried out among clinicians from the Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Anaesthesia departments. Three rounds of consensus were carried out via survey and Webinar discussions. RESULTS: A 50-points score system consisting of 4 domains with 4 subdomains was formed. The CCTS were categorized into the hospital capacity, patient factors, disease severity, and surgery complexity domains. A score between 30 and 50 points indicated that the proposed operation should proceed without delay. A score of less than 20 indicates that the proposed operation should be postponed. A score between 20 and 29 indicates that the surgery falls within a grey area where further discussion should be undertaken to make a joint justification for approval of surgery. CONCLUSION: This study is a proof of concept for the novel CCTS scoring system to prioritize surgeries to meet the rapidly changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers a simple and objective method to stratify patients who require surgery and allows these complex and difficult decisions to be unbiased and made transparently among surgeons and hospital administrators.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 promptly spread across China and around the world. However, there are controversies about whether preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury complication (AKI) are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASUREMENTS: Studies reported the kidney outcomes in different severity of COVID-19 were included in this study. Standardized mean differences or odds ratios were calculated by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software. RESULTS: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395 COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that preexisting CKD (OR = 3.28), complication of AKI (OR = 11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53), received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) were significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were remarkably elevated in the critical group than that in the severe group. CONCLUSIONS: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19. CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. The risk of AKI is higher in the critical group than that in the severe group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that the risk and clinical prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are related to low vitamin D status; however, the data are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic search was conducted with PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to September 25, 2020. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results. Random - or fixed - effect models based on heterogeneity were used for the meta-analysis. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 10 articles with 361, 934 participants were selected for meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled OR in the fixed-effect model showed that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.05). In addition, COVID-19-positive individuals had lower vitamin D levels than those with COVID-19-negative individuals (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.21). Significant heterogeneity existed in both endpoints. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests revealed significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that low vitamin D status may be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the clinical severity and prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the status quo of engineering education, especially in highly interactive, hands-on design classes. Here, we present an example of how we effectively adjusted an intensive hands-on, group project-based engineering course, Medical Device Design & Innovation, to a remote learning curriculum. We first describe the modifications we made. Drawing from student pre and post feedback surveys and our observations, we conclude that our adaptations were overall successful. Our experience may guide educators who are transitioning their engineering design courses to remote learning.

AB  - Health equity is a very important part of social equity. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in a short period of time exposed the problems existing in the allocation of medical resources and the response to major public health emergencies in China. By using Kernel density estimation and Data envelopment analysis (DEA), it is found that the allocation and imbalance of medical resources in China are greatly different among regions, and the polarization phenomenon is obvious. As an important part of the information technology system, blockchain technology is characterized by decentralization and non-tampering. It can realize sharing of medical resources through a mechanism of resource storage, circulation, supervision, and protection. The construction of a medical resource sharing mechanism under the condition of blockchain technology will greatly improve the degree of medical resource sharing, will narrow the differences in resource allocation between regions, and can effectively respond to an outbreak of major public health emergencies.

AB  - Our systematic literature collection and annotation identified 106 chemical drugs and 31 antibodies effective against the infection of at least one human coronavirus (including SARS-CoV, SAR-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV) in vitro or in vivo in an experimental or clinical setting. A total of 163 drug protein targets were identified, and 125 biological processes involving the drug targets were significantly enriched based on a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) was used as an ontological platform to represent the anti-coronaviral drugs, chemical compounds, drug targets, biological processes, viruses, and the relations among these entities. In addition to new term generation, CIDO also adopted various terms from existing ontologies and developed new relations and axioms to semantically represent our annotated knowledge. The CIDO knowledgebase was systematically analyzed for scientific insights. To support rational drug design, a "Host-coronavirus interaction (HCI) checkpoint cocktail" strategy was proposed to interrupt the important checkpoints in the dynamic HCI network, and ontologies would greatly support the design process with interoperable knowledge representation and reasoning.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has swept over the world and causes thousands of deaths. Although the clinical features of COVID-19 become much clearer than before, there are still further problems with the pathophysiological process and treatments of severe patients. One primary problem is with the paradoxical immune states in severe patients with COVID-19. Studies indicate that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can attack the immune system, manifested as a state of immunosuppression with a decrease in lymphocytes, whereas a state of hyperinflammation, presenting as elevated cytokine levels, is also detected in COVID-19. Therefore, discussing the specific status of immunity in COVID-19 will contribute to the understanding of its pathophysiology and the search for appropriate treatments. Here, we review all the available literature concerning the different immune states in COVID-19 and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, the association between immune states and the development and severity of disease as well as the impact on the selection of immunotherapy strategies are discussed in our review.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak of COVID-19 has been a pandemic that infected more than 25.32 million people and caused more than 848.25 thousand deaths worldwide at the time of 1st September 2020. Despite governmental initiatives aimed to contain the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in medical equipment and larger testing capacity. The current diagnosis based on nuclear acid requires specialized instruments, time-consuming, and laborious, the low-cost and convenient technologies were still urgently needed. Both spike and nucleocapsid are key structural proteins of COVID-19 with good immunogenicity, can serve as primary targets for immunoassay. After comparative research, we certified nucleocapsid antigen-monoclonal antibody (mAbs) system was more suitable for the COVID-19 immunodetection. Subsequently, we designed a rapid test strip based on it that can be used in large-scale screening of COVID-19 in population and more suitable for some remote and special needs areas were restricted by a medical condition or for quick and large quantities of screenings.

AB  - Introduction Dental procedures produce splatter and aerosol which have potential to spread pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. Mixed evidence exists on the aerosol-generating potential of orthodontic procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate splatter and/or settled aerosol contamination during orthodontic debonding.Material and methods Fluorescein dye was introduced into the oral cavity of a mannequin. Orthodontic debonding was undertaken with surrounding samples collected. Composite bonding cement was removed using a speed-increasing handpiece with dental suction. A positive control condition included a water-cooled, high-speed air-turbine crown preparation. Samples were analysed using digital image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis.Results Contamination across the eight-metre experimental rig was 3% of the positive control on spectrofluorometric analysis and 0% on image analysis. Contamination of the operator, assistant and mannequin was 8%, 25% and 28% of the positive control, respectively.Discussion Splatter and settled aerosol from orthodontic debonding is distributed mainly within the immediate locality of the mannequin. Widespread contamination was not observed.Conclusions Orthodontic debonding is unlikely to produce widespread contamination via splatter and settled aerosol, but localised contamination is likely. This highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for the operator, assistant and patient. Further work is required to examine suspended aerosol.

AB  - Romania officially declared its first SARS-CoV-2 case on February 26, 2020. The first and largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania was recorded in Suceava, N/E region of the country, and originated at the Suceava regional county hospital. Following sheltering-in-place measures, infection rates decreased, only to rise again after relaxation of measures. This study describes the incursion of SARS-CoV-2 in Suceava and other parts of Romania and analyzes the mutations and their association with clinical manifestation of the disease during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated multiple sites of origin for SARS-CoV-2 strains in Suceava, specifically from Spain, Italy and Russia, but also other strains related to those from Czech Republic, Belgium and France. Most Suceava samples contained mutations common to European lineages, such as A20268G, however aproximately 10% of samples were missing such mutations, indicating a possible different origin. While overall genome regions ORF1ab, S and ORF7 were subject to most mutations, several recurring mutations such as C27707T were identified, and these were mainly present in severe forms of the disease. Non-synonymous mutations, such as C3225A (Thr987Asn in NSP3a domain), associated with changes in a protein responsible for decreasing viral tethering in human host were also present. Patients with diabetes and hypertension exhibited eight and three time,s respectively, higher odds ratios of acquiring severe forms of the disease and these were mainly related to C27707T mutation. These results will aid in tracing virus movement throughout Romania and identification of infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant of The Ministry of Education and Research, UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P2-2.1-SOL-2020-0142, within PNCDI III.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Patients signed informed consent for data access and the study was approved by the University of Suceava Research Ethics Committee.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - To investigate the systemic metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed 1H NMR spectroscopic data on human blood plasma and co-modeled with multiple plasma cytokines and chemokines (measured in parallel). Thus, 600 MHz 1H solvent-suppressed single-pulse, spin-echo, and 2D J-resolved spectra were collected on plasma recorded from SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR-positive patients (n = 15, with multiple sampling timepoints) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 34, confirmed rRT-PCR negative), together with patients with COVID-19/influenza-like clinical symptoms who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative (n = 35). We compared the single-pulse NMR spectral data with in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) information on quantitative lipoprotein profiles (112 parameters) extracted from the raw 1D NMR data. All NMR methods gave highly significant discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with individual NMR methods, giving different diagnostic information windows on disease-induced phenoconversion. Longitudinal trajectory analysis in selected patients indicated that metabolic recovery was incomplete in individuals without detectable virus in the recovery phase. We observed four plasma cytokine clusters that expressed complex differential statistical relationships with multiple lipoproteins and metabolites. These included the following: cluster 1, comprising MIP-1β, SDF-1α, IL-22, and IL-1α, which correlated with multiple increased LDL and VLDL subfractions; cluster 2, including IL-10 and IL-17A, which was only weakly linked to the lipoprotein profile; cluster 3, which included IL-8 and MCP-1 and were inversely correlated with multiple lipoproteins. IL-18, IL-6, and IFN-γ together with IP-10 and RANTES exhibited strong positive correlations with LDL1-4 subfractions and negative correlations with multiple HDL subfractions. Collectively, these data show a distinct pattern indicative of a multilevel cellular immune response to SARS CoV-2 infection interacting with the plasma lipoproteome giving a strong and characteristic immunometabolic phenotype of the disease. We observed that some patients in the respiratory recovery phase and testing virus-free were still metabolically highly abnormal, which indicates a new role for these technologies in assessing full systemic recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contextual factors including poverty and inequitable gender norms harm refugee adolescent and youths' wellbeing. Our study focused on Bidi Bidi refugee settlement that hosts more than 230,000 of Uganda's 1.4 million refugees. We explored contextual factors associated with wellbeing among refugee adolescents and youth aged 16-24 in Bidi Bidi refugee settlement. METHODS: We conducted 6 focus groups (n = 3: women, n = 3: men) and 10 individual interviews with young refugees aged 16-24 living in Bidi Bidi. We used physical distancing practices in a private outdoor space. Focus groups and individual interviews explored socio-environmental factors associated with refugee youth wellbeing. Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded by two investigators using thematic analysis. Analysis was informed by a social contextual theoretical approach that considers the interplay between material (resource access), symbolic (cultural norms and values), and relational (social relationships) contextual factors that can enable or constrain health promotion. RESULTS: Participants included 58 youth (29 men; 29 women), mean age was 20.9 (range 16-24). Most participants (82.8%, n = 48) were from South Sudan and the remaining from the Democratic Republic of Congo (17.2% [n = 10]). Participant narratives revealed the complex interrelationships between material, symbolic and relational contexts that shaped wellbeing. Resource constraints of poverty, food insecurity, and unemployment (material contexts) produced stress and increased sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) targeting adolescent girls and women. These economic insecurities exacerbated inequitable gender norms (symbolic contexts) to increase early marriage and transactional sex (relational context) among adolescent girls and young women. Gendered tasks such as collecting water and firewood also increased SGBV exposure among girls and young women, and this was exacerbated by deforestation. Participants reported negative community impacts (relational context) of COVID-19 that were associated with fear and panic, alongside increased social isolation due to business, school and church closures. CONCLUSIONS: Resource scarcity produced pervasive stressors among refugee adolescents and youth. Findings signal the importance of gender transformative approaches to SGBV prevention that integrate attention to resource scarcity. These may be particularly relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings signal the importance of developing health enabling social contexts with and for refugee adolescents and youth.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a lower respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease can impact the cardiovascular system and lead to abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the ECG manifestations of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review outlines the pathophysiology and electrocardiographic findings associated with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is a potentially critical illness associated with a variety of ECG abnormalities, with up to 90% of critically ill patients demonstrating at least one abnormality. The ECG abnormalities in COVID-19 may be due to cytokine storm, hypoxic injury, electrolyte abnormalities, plaque rupture, coronary spasm, microthrombi, or direct endothelial or myocardial injury. While sinus tachycardia is the most common abnormality, others include supraventricular tachycardias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, various bradycardias, interval and axis changes, and ST segment and T wave changes. Several ECG presentations are associated with poor outcome, including atrial fibrillation, QT interval prolongation, ST segment and T wave changes, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the relevant ECG findings associated with COVID-19. Knowledge of these findings in COVID-19-related electrocardiographic presentations may assist emergency clinicians in the evaluation and management of potentially infected and infected patients.

AB  - Thrombotic events that frequently occur in COVID-19 are predominantly venous thromboemboli (VTE) and are associated with increasing disease severity and worse clinical outcomes. Distinctive microvascular abnormalities in COVID-19 include endothelial inflammation, disruption of intercellular junctions and microthrombi formation. A distinct COVID-19-associated coagulopathy along with increased cytokines and activation of platelets, endothelium and complement occur in COVID-19, which is more frequent with worsening disease severity. This proinflammatory milieu may result in immunothrombosis, a host defence mechanism that can become dysregulated, leading to excess formation of immunologically mediated thrombi which predominantly affect the microvasculature. The haemostatic and immune systems are intricately linked, and multifactorial processes are likely to contribute to VTE and immunothrombosis in COVID-19. This state-of-the-art review will explore the pathobiological mechanisms of immunothrombosis and VTE in COVID-19 focusing on: COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, pathology, endothelial dysfunction and haemostasis, the immune system and thrombosis, genetic associations and additional thrombotic mechanisms. An understanding of the complex interplay between these processes is necessary for developing and assessing how new treatments affect VTE and immunothrombosis in COVID-19.

AB  - This timely editorial paper outlines some of the main emerging research on technological topics on health and education approaches to Internet use-related problems before and during the beginning of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: The aim is to provide a brief overview to facilitate a rapid comprehensive and practical approach to these new trends to promote research, interventions, education, and prevention. METHODS: The rapid review includes an analysis of both health and education technologies studies on Internet use-related addiction problems included in the Special Issue "Internet and Smartphone Use-Related Addiction Health Problems: Treatment, Education and Research" to extract recent findings and a few reflections about the development of the field before and during the first wave of the COVID-19. RESULTS: Main findings highlighted studies which tended to be empirical, with a relational type associating specific addictive problems with individual and a few contextual factors in adult populations. Psychometric studies about scales are prevalent, but predictive and mixed methods ones are starting to emerge, together with reviews about conceptualisation, measure, treatment, and prevention. CONCLUSIONS: From the arrival of Internet, our societies have converged in a global culture which has impacted health and educational domains. Internet use-related addiction problems have globally emerged and common knowledge, advances, and strategies exist to overcome challenges which are starting to be tested, and prevention interest has arisen in a pandemic situation with global health problems holistically tackled.

AB  - This review aimed to gather the available literature investigating the effects of probiotics against the most common viral infections using in vitro trials in cell lines and in vivo clinical trials in both experimental animals and humans. Probiotics were employed to prevent and reduce symptoms of infections caused by common viruses, especially respiratory tract viruses, but also for viral digestive infections (such as rotavirus, coronavirus, or norovirus) and other viral infections (such as viruses that cause hepatitis, human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes simplex virus). Different probiotics have been studied to see their possible effect against the abovementioned viruses, among which different Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus can be highlighted. In many cases, mixtures of various probiotic strains were used. Although the results obtained did not show similar results, in most cases, probiotic supplementation improved both barrier and biochemical immune responses, decreased susceptibility to viral infections, and enhanced the effects of concomitant vaccines. Works collected in this review show a beneficial effect of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of different viral infections. We found interesting results related to the prevention of viral infections, reduction of the duration of diseases, and decrease of symptoms.

AB  - The meteoric rise of telemedicine early in the COVID-19 pandemic might easily be mistaken for an ephemeral trend-one reaching its zenith in a moment of crisis. To the contrary, momentum has been mounting for telehealth over decades. The recent increase in telecare reveals its potential to deliver efficient, patient-centered, high-quality care in an increasingly technology-dependent landscape. Prior to COVID-19, surgeons lagged behind medical counterparts in embracing telemedicine; however, the pragmatic imperatives for remote care of patients and changes to Medicare removed key barriers to adoption. Otolaryngology-head and neck surgery has innovated across subspecialties, leading in COVID-19 scholarship and year-over-year publications on telemedicine. Yet, improved access to subspecialists is tempered by a digital divide that threatens to exacerbate disparities. Otolaryngology is poised to lead the transformation of procedural specialties while ensuring equitable care.

AB  - The "lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related" is one of the classical theories in traditional Chinese medicine, which indicates a close correlation between the lung and large intestine in physiology and pathology, and plays a pivotal role in guiding the treatment of the lung and bowel diseases. Modern medicine has revealed some connections between the lung and large intestine in tissue origin and mucosal immunity, and preliminarily illuminated the material basis and possible regulatory mechanism of the theory. Recently, this theory has been applied to guide the treatment of refractory lung and intestine diseases such as COVID-19 and ulcerative colitis and has obtained reliable efficacy. Existing research results show that the anatomical homogeneity of lung and large intestine promotes the correlation between lung-bowel mucosal immunity, and mucosal immunity and migration and homing of innate lymphocytes are one of the physiological and pathological mechanisms for lung and large intestine to share. Under the guidance of this theory, Chinese medicines with heat-clearing and detoxifying or tonic effects are commonly used in the treatment of the lung and intestinal diseases by regulating lung-bowel mucosal immunity and they can be candidate drugs to treat lung/intestinal diseases simultaneously. However, the existing studies on immune regulation are mainly focused on the expression levels of sIgA and cytokines, as well as the changes in the number of immune cells such as innate lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. While the following aspects need further investigation: the airway/intestinal mucous hypersecretion, the functional changes of pulmonary and intestinal mucosal barrier immune cells, the dynamic process of lung/intestinal mucosal immune interaction, the intervention effect of local pulmonary/intestinal microecology, the correlation and biological basis between the heat-clearing and detoxifying effect and the tonic effect, and its regulation of pulmonary/intestinal mucosal immunity. In this paper, we try to analyze the internal relationship between lung and intestine related diseases from the point of view of the common mucosal immune system of lung and intestine, and summarize the characteristics and rules of traditional Chinese medicine compound and its active ingredients, which have regulatory effect on lung and intestine mucosal immune system, so as to further explain the theoretical connotation of "lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related" and provide reference for the research and development of drugs for related diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND An integrated nonprofit health care system with 13 North Carolina medical centers conducted a time-pressured quality improvement simulation of its plan to implement the "North Carolina Protocol for Allocating Scarce Inpatient Critical Care Resources in a Pandemic" attendant to pandemic scenario planning. Simulation objectives included assessing the plan in terms of a) efficiency and effectiveness; b) comorbidity scoring validity; c) impact by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and payer status; and d) simulation participant impressions of potential impact on clinicians.METHOD The simulation scenario involved scoring 14 patients with the constraint that only 10 could be afforded critical care resources. Also included were independent scoring validation by four clinicians, structured debriefs with simulation participants and observers, and tracking patient outcomes for 30 days.RESULTS Triage scoring was identical among four triage teams. Lack of concordance in clinician comorbidity scoring did not alter patient prioritization for withdrawal of treatment in this small cohort. Protocol scoring was not correlated with resource utilization or near-term mortality.LIMITATIONS The simulation sample was small and selected when COVID-19 census was temporarily waning. No protocol for pediatric patients was tested.CONCLUSIONS The simulation yielded resource allocation concordance using comorbidity scoring by attending physicians, which significantly accelerated triage team decision-making and did not result in notable disparities by race/ethnicity, gender, or advanced age. Qualitative findings surfaced tensions in balancing de-identified data with individualized assessment and in trusting the clinical judgments of other physicians. Additional research is needed to validate the protocol's predictive value related to patient outcomes.

AB  - Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) bear disproportionate burden of COVID-19 and are prioritized for vaccine deployment. LTCF outbreaks could continue occurring during vaccine rollout due to incomplete population coverage, and the effect of vaccines on viral transmission are currently unknown. Declining adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against within-facility transmission could therefore limit the effectiveness of vaccination. We built a stochastic model to simulate outbreaks in LTCF populations with differing vaccination coverage and NPI adherence to evaluate their interacting effects. Vaccination combined with strong NPI adherence produced the least morbidity and mortality. Healthcare worker vaccination improved outcomes in unvaccinated LTCF residents but was less impactful with declining NPI adherence. To prevent further illness and deaths, there is a continued need for NPIs in LTCFs during vaccine rollout.Competing Interest StatementDrs.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and phased nationwide lockdown have impacted negatively on individuals with tuberculosis (TB) and routine TB services. Through a literature review and the perspective of members of a national TB Think Tank task team, we describe the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on TB patients and services as well as the potential long-term setback to TB control in South Africa (SA). Strategies to mitigate risk and impact are explored, together with opportunities to leverage synergies from both diseases to the benefit of the National TB Programme (NTP). With the emergence of COVID-19, activities to address this new pandemic have been prioritised across all sectors. Within the health system, the health workforce and resources have been redirected away from routine services towards the new disease priority. The social determinants of health have deteriorated during the lockdown, potentially increasing progression to TB disease and impacting negatively on people with TB and their households, resulting in additional barriers to accessing TB care, with early reports of a decline in TB testing rates. Fewer TB diagnoses, less attention to adherence and support during TB treatment, poorer treatment outcomes and consequent increased transmission will increase the TB burden and TB-related mortality. People with TB or a history of TB are likely to be vulnerable to COVID-19. Modifications to current treatment practices are suggested to reduce visits to health facilities and minimise the risks of COVID-19 exposure. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact on TB control in TB-endemic settings such as SA. However, there are COVID-19-related health systems-strengthening developments that may help the NTP mitigate the impact of the pandemic on TB control. By integrating TB case finding into the advanced screening, testing, tracing and monitoring systems established for COVID-19, TB case finding and linkage to care could increase, with many more TB patients starting treatment. Similarly, integrating knowledge and awareness of TB into the increased healthcare worker and community education on infectious respiratory diseases, behavioural practices around infection prevention and control, and cough etiquette, including destigmatisation of mask use, may contribute to reducing TB transmission. However, these potential gains could be overwhelmed by the impact of increasing poverty and other social determinants of health on the burden of TB.

AB  - Background: The aim of this rapid perspective review is to capture key changes to memorialisation practices resulting from social distancing rules implemented due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Method: As published peer-reviewed research pertaining to memorialisation practices during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking, this rapid review includes academic literature from the pre-COVID-19 period and international media reports during the pandemic. Findings: Changes to memorialisation practices were under way before COVID-19, as consumer preferences shifted towards secularisation and personalisation of ritual and ceremony. However, several key changes to memorialisation practices connected with body preparation, funerals, cremation, burials and rituals have taken place as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Although boundaries between public and private memorialisation practices were already blurred, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process. Without access to public memorialisation, practices are increasingly private in nature. A number of implications are considered for the bereaved, service providers and policy makers. Conclusion: Forms of memorialisation and bereavement support emerging during the pandemic that blend the public and the private are likely to persist in a post-pandemic world.

AB  - Severe emerging and re-emerging viral infections such as Lassa fever, Avian influenza (AI), and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 urgently call for new strategies for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved components in the virus life cycle. Viral lipids are essential components, and viral-cell membrane fusion is the required entry step for most unrelated enveloped viruses. In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses including Lassa virus (LASV), Machupo virus (MACV), and SARS-CoV-2 as well as various subtypes of influenza A viral strains with IC50 values ranging from 0.91 ± 0.25 μM to 1.88 ± 0.34 μM. A mechanistic study using influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a testing strain showed that PPIX inhibits the infection in the early stage of virus entry through biophysically interacting with the hydrophobic lipids of enveloped virions, thereby inhibiting the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the preliminary antiviral activities of PPIX were further assessed by testing mice infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The results showed that compared with the control group without drug treatment, the survival rate and mean survival time of the mice treated with PPIX were apparently prolonged. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using PPIX as a lead compound for the rational design of lipid-targeting antivirals for the treatment of infection with enveloped viruses.

AB  - Africa's health systems are strained by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are global efforts toward the development and trial of COVID-19 vaccines. However, considering the challenges and economic conditions of African nations, there could be limited access and availability of the vaccines on the continent. This will be the result of high cost and technical requirements to acquire the vaccines. There are indications that possible donor funding for COVID-19 vaccines from rich countries maybe put off considering the various challenges they face currently and the moves they are making in response to the disease. The issue of justice in health for protecting the vulnerable populations and regions also supports the need for COVID-19 vaccine availability on the African continent. Means to achieve uniform control of the disease burden across the globe should be adopted. Governments of African nations should also scale up their efforts toward COVID-19 vaccine acquisition and utilization through viable efforts. It is therefore important to assist the African continent in acquiring the COVID-19 vaccines by leveling all power dynamics that will affect access and distribution.

AB  - The dissemination of COVID-19 around the globe was followed by an increased consumption of antibiotics. This is related to the concern for bacterial superinfection in COVID-19 patients. Identification of bacterial pathogens is challenging in low and middle income countries (LMIC) as there are no readily-available cost-effective, clinical or biologic markers that effectively discriminate between bacterial and viral infections. Fortunately, faced with the threat of COVID-19 spread, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs as well as infection prevention and control measures that could help reduce the microbial load and hence circulation of pathogens with reduction in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. These measures should be improved particularly in developing countries. Studies need to be conducted to evaluate the worldwide evolution of antimicrobial resistance during the COVID-19 pandemic because pathogens do not respect borders. This issue takes on even greater importance in developing countries where scare data on resistance patterns and optimal conditions for infectious pathogen transmission coexist with the suboptimal treatment resources.

AB  - Since its outbreak in China, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused worldwide disaster. Globally, there have been 71,581,532 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,618,374 deaths, reported to World Health Organization (data retrieved on December 16, 2020). Currently, no treatment modalities for COVID-19 (e.g., vaccines or antiviral drugs) with confirmed efficacy and safety are available. Although the possibilities and relevant challenges of some alternatives (e.g., use of stem cells as immunomodulators) have been proposed, the personal protective equipment is still the only way to protect and lower infection rates of COVID-19 among healthcare workers and airway managers (intubators). In this article, we described the combined use of a plastic sheet as a barrier with the intubating stylet for tracheal intubation in patients needing mechanical ventilation. Although conventional or video-assisted laryngoscopy is more popular and familiar to other groups around the world, we believe that the video-assisted intubating stylet technique is much easier to learn and master. Advantages of the video stylet include the creation of greater working distance between intubator and patient, less airway stimulation, and less pharyngeal space needed for endotracheal tube advancement. All the above features make this technique reliable and superior to other devices, especially when a difficult airway is encountered in COVID scenario. Meanwhile, we proposed the use of a flexible and transparent plastic sheet to serve as a barrier against aerosol and droplet spread during airway management. We demonstrated that the use of a plastic sheet would not interfere or hinder the intubator's maneuvers during endotracheal intubation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the plastic sheet was effective in preventing the spread of mist and water spray in simulation models with a mannequin. In our experience, we found that this technique most effectively protected the intubator and other operating room personnel from infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC, e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, (CTAB)) are widely used as surfactants and disinfectants. QAC already are commonly found in wastewaters, and their concentration could increase, since QAC are recommended to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Exposure of bacteria to QAC can lead to proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). In particular, O2-based membrane biofilm reactors (O2-MBfRs) achieved excellent CTAB biodegradation, but ARG increased in their biofilms. Here, we applied meta-transcriptomic analyses to assess the impacts of CTAB exposure and operating conditions on microbial community's composition and ARG expression in the O2-MBfRs. Two opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, dominated the microbial communities and were associated with the presence of ARG. Operating conditions that imposed stress on the biofilms, i.e., limited supplies of O2 and nitrogen or a high loading of CTAB, led to large increases in ARG expression, particularly for genes conferring antibiotic-target protection. Important within the efflux pumps was the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family, which may have been active in exporting CTAB from cells. Oxidative stress appeared to be the key factor that triggered ARG proliferation by selecting intrinsically resistant species and accentuating the expression of ARG. Our findings suggest that means to mitigate the spread of ARG, such as shown here in a O2-based membrane biofilm reactor, need to consider the impacts of stressors, including QAC exposure and stressful operating conditions.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly developed into a global pneumonia pandemic. At present, COVID-19 has caused more than 70,000,000 confirmed cases with over 1,500,000 deaths worldwide, as reported by WHO. Cardiovascular disease is the major comorbidity of COVID-19 patients and is closely related to the severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can directly or indirectly cause a series of cardiac complications, including acute myocardial injury and myocarditis, heart failure and cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and coagulation abnormalities. Intensive research on the SARS-CoV-2-associated cardiovascular complications is urgently needed to elucidate its exact mechanism and to identify potential drug targets, which will help to formulate effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will summarize recent progress regarding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system and describe the underlying mechanism of cardiovascular injury caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The intent of this review is to critically consider the data that support the concept of programming and its implications. Birth weight and growth trajectories during childhood are associated with cardiometabolic disease in adult life. Both extremes, low and high birth weight coupled with postnatal growth increase the early presence of cardiometabolic risk factors and vascular imprinting, crucial elements of this framework. Data coming from epigenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiota added relevant information and contribute to better understanding of mechanisms as well as development of biomarkers helping to move forward to take actions. Research has reached a stage in which sufficiently robust data calls for new initiatives focused on early life. Prevention starting early in life is likely to have a very large impact on reducing disease incidence and its associated effects at the personal, economic, and social levels.

AB  - COVID-19 has put each and every one at test. Cardiological clinics are facing constrained resources, limiting timely treatment of patients as usual. Patients with valvular heart disease are one of the most time sensitive patient populations, with delayed therapy possible leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Identifying and allocating the available resources to the most vulnerable patients is crucial in providing optimal patient care with prioritization of essential surgical or percutaneous procedures for valvular heart disease. Implementing telemedicine approaches might help to minimize non-essential physician-to-patient contact to ensure safety, for both patients and lastly but not least the treating physicians.

AB  - The World population is facing a health challenge never seen since the Spanish influenza of one hundred years ago. During the last months, the scientific community has been debating on the potential harmful effect of Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or Angiotensin II receptor Type 1 receptor blockers (AT1-Receptor blockers, ARBs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is because the S spike protein of SARS8 CoV viruses utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter alveolar epithelial cells. Obesity, often associated to type 2 Diabetes, was shown to worsen the prognosis of SARS-CoV2 infection. Herein we discuss the complex interaction between the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), its receptors, and the interaction with the Kallikrein-Kinin-System (KKS) and the potential activation of the coagulation cascade. Alteration of the equilibrium between the RAAS system and the KKS cascade may explain the frequent thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 mainly seen in obese and diabetic-obese patients. In contrast, angiotensin (1-7) contributes to maintaining a correct balance between RAAS and KKS system. Our conclusion is that the higher mortality rate in patients with obesity is linked to the alteration of RAS and RAS-KKS interaction consequent to SARS-CoV2-cell entrance. At present, no data support the necessity of modifying ACEi or ARBs treatment in hypertensive patients.

AB  - Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, rapidly grew into a global pandemic. How SARS-CoV-2 evolved remains unclear. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis using the available genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related coronaviruses. Results: The ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of the spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 was markedly higher than that between other coronaviruses (range, 1.29-4.81); the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 was the lowest among all the performed comparisons, suggesting evolution under stringent selective pressure. Notably, the relative proportion of the T:C transition was markedly higher between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 than between other compared coronaviruses. Codon usage is similar across these coronaviruses and is unlikely to explain the increased number of synonymous mutations. Moreover, some sites of the spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Conclusions: Our results showed an increased proportion of synonymous substitutions and the T:C transition between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. Further investigation of the mutation pattern mechanism would contribute to understanding viral pathogenicity and its adaptation to hosts.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to spread rapidly around the world and nearly 20 millions people are infected. This paper utilises both single-locus analysis and joint-SNPs analysis for detection of significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phenotypes of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, the early collection time vs. the late collection time, the old vs. the young, and the male vs. the female. Also, this paper analyses the relationship between any two SNPs via linkage disequilibrium analysis, and visualises the patterns of cumulative mutations of SNPs over collection time. The results are in three folds. First, the SNP which locates at the nucleotide position 4321 is found to be an independent significant locus associated with all the first three phenotypes. Moreover, 12 significant SNPs are found in the first two studies. Second, gene orf1ab containing SNP-4321 is detected to be significantly associated with the first three phenotypes, and the three genes, S, ORF3a, and N, are detected significant in the first two phenotypes. Third, some of the detected genes or SNPs are related to the SARS-COV-2 as supported by literature survey, which indicates that the results here may be helpful for further investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The introduction of the Stroke Platform (SP) in the Belgorod Region to improve the efficiency of diagnosis and care for patients with stroke. Stroke platform is a unified information platform that unites all stages of treatment of a patient with stroke, from the first symptoms to dispensary observation by a family doctor and control of targeted provision of medicines for the secondary prevention of vascular events. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The SP includes 6 modules: the Central Archive of Medical Images or the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and connection to a single circuit of all CT devices of the regional medical institutions; Stroke register; secondary prevention register; routing bureau; statistics and analytics; COVID platform. The SP, as it develops, can be supplemented with those modules that are necessary to improve the quality and availability of patient care. More than 100 consultations of CT images are carried out monthly through the SP, the average response time is less than 10 minutes, 52 platform participants are in constant contact, all medical institutions of the region are connected. Five hundred and forty patients were consulted for 6 months of 2020. RESULTS: The share of hospitalizations in specialized departments increased to 97.6% versus 86.3%. The availability of high-tech medical care for patients with stroke has increased due to timely transfer to the district vascular center. Endovascular interventions for aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, stenting of extracerebral arteries during dissection, mechanical thrombectomy from large arteries are performed. Mortality decreased from 19.7% (2019) to 17.6%. At the stage of outpatient follow-up, it is possible to obtain information about the range of those drugs that are prescribed to the patient for prophylaxis and are delivered to the target. CONCLUSION: The main feature of the SP is the speed and efficiency of making medical decisions, ergonomics and ease of interaction, a single workspace.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, many grandparents in China have spent more time with their grandchildren than they used to. When their adult children returned to work after a period of lockdown, many grandparents extended their roles from taking care of household tasks and looking after their grandchildren's basic needs to supervising their online learning and providing academic support. It has been a precious opportunity for both the children and their grandparents to get to know each other better and to learn from each other. During this challenging period of home learning, a Chinese initiative called the "Shaping Students' Vacation Life Project" (SSVLP), which is led by the Shanghai Municipal Institute for Lifelong Education (SMILE) of East China Normal University (ECNU), conducted a two-month project that investigated intergenerational learning between grandparents and grandchildren (IL-GP&GC) across seven primary schools located in six areas of China. They explored topics such as pandemic prevention, health and fitness, traditional culture and information literacy. Following this, the co-authors of this article conducted an interpretive inquiry to explore how the participating primary schools implemented the IL-GP&GC project, and to understand its impact. Based on in-depth interviews with 11 teachers and 7 families (including 7 grandchildren aged 7-13, and their 7 grandparents aged 60-68), four main findings emerged: (1) both generations gained more health knowledge, life skills and values; (2) the older generation changed their learning perspective and behaviours; (3) the younger generation understood their grandparents more and cultivated the concept of lifelong learning; and (4) the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren became closer.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has a profound impact on people with existing mental disorders, augmenting the prevailing inequalities in mental health. Methods: In order to understand the status of telepsychiatry in India and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health and its potential applications, a scoping review was done between March 2020 and May 2020. The literature review revealed 253 papers, which were used to derive the primary framework for analysis. The information was then reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were integrated with evidence from gray literature and categorized under broader themes based on the insights derived. Finally, a thematic framework was developed for discussion to tailor scientific information for decision-makers' needs. Results: Review findings are summarized under the following headings: changing patterns of health-seeking behavior, origin and evolution of telepsychiatry, possible applications of telepsychiatry and AI, technological features, and AI models in mental health. Conclusions: Though there are several potential opportunities, the time is not yet ripe for telepsychiatry and AI to be adopted fully in the field of mental health care. But it is time that we develop indigenous proprietary technology and test and validate it. With many solutions offered by telepsychiatry and AI, psychiatrists must choose an appropriate tool based on their requirements, availability of resources, and feasibility of deployment. Harmony between conventional care and technology-based care must be reached gradually.

AB  - The sensitive detection of coronavirus is of vital importance for the prevention of its rapid spread. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death in neonatal piglets. In this work, a novel PCN-224-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) system was constructed for PEDV detection with high sensitivity. We found that PCN-224 can be employed as an ECL reporter with a strong signal because of its zirconium-based organic porous frame nanomaterial with a large specific surface area and stable structure. TiO2 nanoparticles were used as an accelerator for the first time to promote the reduction of coreactant potassium peroxydisulfate on the cathode; thus, the initial ECL signal of PCN-224 was significantly amplified. In the presence of PEDV, the ECL signal decreased due to the block effect to electron transfer. As a result, the novel "signal off" biosensor achieved a sensitive detection of PEDV ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.4 pg/mL (S/N = 3). Importantly, the PCN-224 nanomaterial enriched the ECL system in biological analysis, and the proposed strategy provided a new route for coronavirus detection.

AB  - Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities have issued several guidelines to curb the pandemic's disastrous effects. However, measures' effectiveness is dependent upon people's adherence to them. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the potential factors that explain guideline adherence. In the present brief research report, we investigated need for structure and trait victimhood, i.e., the tendency to feel like a victim, and their effect on fear of the pandemic, which in turn, predicted guideline adherence. Furthermore, the association between fear and guideline adherence was shaped by participants' global self-efficacy: higher levels of self-efficacy predicted more guideline adherence regardless of fear levels. The present findings may be relevant to health messaging endeavors aiming to improve compliance with guidelines.

AB  - Misinformation and disinformation ("fake news") about vaccines are contagious-travelling faster and farther than truth. The consequences are serious; leading to negative impacts on health decisions, including vaccine acceptance, and on trust in immunization advice from public health and/or healthcare professional. This article provides a brief overview of evidence-based strategies to address vaccine deniers in public, in clinical practice and in social situations. As well, a strategy to help differentiate between vaccine deniers and simple vaccine refusers in a practice or clinic is provided. Five tactics are widely used by vaccine deniers: conspiracy; fake experts; selectivity; impossible expectations; and misrepresentation and false logic. Recognizing and understanding these tactics can help protect against misinformation and science denialism propaganda. Highlighting the strong medical science consensus on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines also helps. Carefully and wisely choosing what to say and speaking up-whether you are at a dinner party, out with friends or in your medical office or clinic-is crucial. Not speaking up implies you agree with the misinformation. Having healthcare providers recognize and address misinformation using evidence-based strategies is of growing importance as the arrival of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is expected to further ramp up the vaccine misinformation and disinformation rhetoric. Healthcare providers must prepare themselves and act now to combat the vaccine misinformation tsunami.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has seen rapid spread, disease mobidities and death associated with substantive social, economic and societal impact. Treatments rely on re-purposed antivirals and immune modulatory agents focusing on attenuating the acute respiratory distress syndrome. No curative therapies exist. Vaccines remain the best hope for disease control and elimination and the principal global effort with success now being realized. Herein, we summarize those developments with a focus on the role played by nanocarrier delivery.

AB  - With telehealth services rescuing patients with chronic neurological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a felt need for simplified teleneurology protocols for neurological disorders in children. Infantile spasms is an epileptic encephalopathy where treatment lag is a significant predictor of outcome. It is one such condition where telemedicine can make a remarkable difference when in-person consultations are delayed or are not possible. However, the adverse effect profile of the first-line therapeutic options, the need for frequent follow-up, underdeveloped telemedicine services, lack of a rational protocol, poor awareness about infantile spasms, a lesser level of parental understanding, and scarcity of pediatric neurologists are the major hurdles in developing countries. This paper provides a teleneurology based approach for the management of infantile spasms in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cornerstones of this approach include the fundamental principles of management of infantile spasms, decentralization of patient care to local health providers, efforts for improving sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis, early initiation of first-line therapeutic options, and constant motivation of parents and local health providers to be vigilant for therapeutic response, adverse effects of therapy, and infections.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the anxiety and fear related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their associations with travel, tourism and hospitality, in the Portuguese population. The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were validated for the Portuguese population and correlations with issues related to travel, tourism and hospitality were established. CAS and FCV-19S presented a good adjustment model and solid reliability and validity. Correlations between CAS and FCV-19S and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 in travel, tourism and hospitality were found. Participants considered that COVID-19 mainly affected their holidays and leisure time. However, the strongest correlation established was between total FCV-19S and emotional fear FCV-19S and the fear of attending hotel facilities. The Portuguese versions of CAS and FCV-19S are reliable psychological tools to assess anxiety and fear in relation to COVID-19 for the general population. The use of hotel facilities is the most threatening issue related to travel, tourism and hospitality. The results suggest that hotels should invest in hygiene and safety measures that allow users to regain confidence in hotel equipment.

AB  - The possible negative impact of severe adult respiratory distress caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) on antimicrobial stewardship and infection control has been postulated, but few real-life data are available. The aim of this study was to report our experience with colonization/infection of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) and Candida auris among critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). All COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs at San Martino Policlinico Hospital-IRCCS in Genoa, Italy, were screened from 28 February to 31 May 2020. One-hundred and eighteen patients admitted to COVID-19 ICUs were included in the study. Among them, 12 (10.2%) became colonized/infected with CRPA, 6 (5.1%) with C. auris and 2 (1.6%) with CR-Kp. All patients with CRPA received prior treatment with meropenem, and in 11 (91.7%) infection was not preceded by colonization. Four patients (66.7%) developed C. auris candidemia. A significant spread of resistant pathogens was observed among critically ill COVID-19 patients. Dedicated strategies are warranted to prevent horizontal spread and maintain effective antimicrobial stewardship programs in the setting of COVID-19 care.

AB  - Countries with abundant solar radiation have the potential to invest in simple technologies for deactivation of many bacteria and viruses in medical solid waste. In addition to the traditional Infection and Prevention Control (IPC) measures, these simple technologies contribute to better protection of health care workers in countries with compromised solid management schemes. Monitoring of temperature, relative humidity and ultraviolet inside containers soundly designed to collect disposal infectious waste illustrated to deactivate several viruses and bacteria. Casanova et al., 2010, used some surrogate viruses to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV, concluded that by temperature above 40 °C most of viruses become below levels of detection after 90 min. Here we are proposing a model of a simple transparent container almost 200 L in volume that allow solar energy to be accumulated inside. In summer conditions in the testing site, temperature inside the container reached above 50 °C when the ambient air temperature was around 30 °C. The container was built using epoxy glass to guarantee maximum heat penetration. Actual temperature measurement inside the container was measured in real time against ambient air temperature. We present a mathematical model for predication of maximum temperature at different positions inside the container and their relation to different ambient air temperature scenarios. The mathematical formulas used are based on the conservation laws and a good agreement of a full month of field measurements were obtained. Even in winter conditions in many of developing countries air temperature can maintain levels above 20 °C, which will produce temperature around 30 °C and viruses can reach levels below detection limit in maximum 3 h.

AB  - On concurring to the current evidence, the myriad of vulnerable COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19) transmission is acquiring through human-to-human transmission through droplets, which is depicting devastating pandemic. Urbanization and industrialization are the major contributing factors to the on-going change in global climate, with increased air pollution and poor air quality. As the global climate and air quality deteriorate, air pollutants remain as a fundamental concern to public health. Air pollution has been globally acknowledged as a major influence and exacerbating factor for human morbidity and mortality influenced on various respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, pneumonia, asthma, and influenza. Patients by long - term exposure to polluted air leads to chronic lung and heart conditions are less able to fight off lung infections and likely to die. Polluted air in developed countries is causing heart and lung damage and is responsible for early deaths in a year. This is also likely the case for COVID-19. The more severe impact by COVID-19 on city dwellers and those exposed to toxic fumes leads to the primary health damage such as respiratory infections than on others. The health damage inflicted on people by long-standing air pollution in cities is likely to increase the death rate by COVID-19. By lowering air pollution levels probability to reduce the spread of most vulnerable viruses by aerosol to fight against any possible future pandemics.

AB  - The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 6 million people globally; and changed the dynamics of the entire world. In March 2020, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In Pakistan, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on 26th February, 2020. The virus is highly contagious and spreads mainly by aerosols. Its major symptoms include sore throat, cough, high-grade fever, anosmia, etc. Like other countries, it has also affected all fields of life in Pakistan, but its impact on dental education and dentistry has been particularly devastating. Dental institutes are at particularly high risk for infection transmission through their aerosol-generating dental procedures. In the scenario of a lockdown, dental students are suffering a lot and the dental colleges and faculties must try their best to overcome this situation.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of health care workers (HCWs), and optimal strategies to provide psychological support for HCWs are not currently established. Aims: To rapidly review recently-published literature on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Query of all quantitative research through the PubMed database on the mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic which utilized validated mental health instruments. 723 articles were screened and 87 articles were included. Results: Nearly all included studies were cross-sectional, survey-based assessments of the prevalence of and risk factors for mental illness. Only one interventional study was identified. Prevalence of mental health outcomes varied widely: 7.0-97.3% anxiety, 10.6-62.1% depression, 2.2-93.8% stress, 3.8-56.6% post traumatic stress, 8.3-88.4% insomnia, and 21.8-46.3% burnout. Risk and protective factors were identified in personal and professional domains, including degree of COVID-19 exposure, adequacy of protective equipment, and perception of organizational support. Conclusions: The myriad risk factors for poor mental health among HCWs suggests that a comprehensive psychosocial support model with individual- and organization-level interventions is necessary. Further longitudinal research on specific evidence-based interventions to mitigate adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs is urgently needed as the pandemic continues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere are no funding sources to report.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Not applicable.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global public health. It increases morbidity and mortality, and is associated with high economic costs due to its health care burden. Infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria also have substantial implications on clinical and economic outcomes. Moreover, increased indiscriminate use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths. This review highlights AMR's scale and consequences, the importance, and implications of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) to fight resistance and protect global health. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), an organizational or system-wide health-care strategy, is designed to promote, improve, monitor, and evaluate the rational use of antimicrobials to preserve their future effectiveness, along with the promotion and protection of public health. ASP has been very successful in promoting antimicrobials' appropriate use by implementing evidence-based interventions. The "One Health" approach, a holistic and multisectoral approach, is also needed to address AMR's rising threat. AMS practices, principles, and interventions are critical steps towards containing and mitigating AMR. Evidence-based policies must guide the "One Health" approach, vaccination protocols, health professionals' education, and the public's awareness about AMR.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have been also discussed for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on this topic and made a summary of current development and future perspectives.

Based on perinatal COVID-19 data we express concerns about theoretical adverse consequences particularly to the offspring, in the framework of non-communicable diseases, which develop slowly across the life-course. The trajectory of risk commences early, in adolescence and the pre/peri-conceptional period to the first years of life.

AB  - Background Physician shortage and healthcare access are serious issues in rural states like Kentucky and further worsened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. International Medical Graduates (IMGs) serve the underserved communities of Kentucky to fill in the physician gap. However, uncertainties surrounding immigration policies added significant challenges to physicians and the rural communities served by them during the pandemic. Methods A survey was created using the data collection platform "SurveyMonkey" and sent to IMG physicians practicing on a visa to understand their role and their immigration-related challenges. Only the physicians practicing in Kentucky were included in this study. Results It was found that 84% practice in primary care specialties like internal medicine, pediatrics, or family medicine, 92.9% practice in Medically Underserved Areas or Health Professional Shortage Areas, and 71.4% practice in rural settings. Also, 61.5% practice in a "frontline" COVID-19 specialty and 92.3% were involved in direct care of COVID-19 infected or suspected patients. Of the physicians, 88.5% were in an "immigration backlog"; 92.6% of them were the primary visa holders of their families and 88.9% expressed concern that their families face hardship if they have a disability during the pandemic. It was reported by 92.3% of them that visa-related restrictions limited them from providing additional coverage in these places. Conclusions Lack of physician access is a critical issue facing many rural states in America like Kentucky, and IMG physicians play a valuable role in taking care of this underserved population and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges surrounding the immigration backlog are contributing to significant hardships and remain a hurdle to expand healthcare access to the rural and medically underserved communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Portable retinal cameras and deep learning (DL) algorithms are novel tools adopted by diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs. Our objective is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a DL algorithm and the performance of portable handheld retinal cameras in the detection of DR in a large and heterogenous type 2 diabetes population in a real-world, high burden setting. METHOD: Participants underwent fundus photographs of both eyes with a portable retinal camera (Phelcom Eyer). Classification of DR was performed by human reading and a DL algorithm (PhelcomNet), consisting of a convolutional neural network trained on a dataset of fundus images captured exclusively with the portable device; both methods were compared. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for more than mild DR. RESULTS: A total of 824 individuals with type 2 diabetes were enrolled at Itabuna Diabetes Campaign, a subset of 679 (82.4%) of whom could be fully assessed. The algorithm sensitivity/specificity was 97.8 % (95% CI 96.7-98.9)/61.4 % (95% CI 57.7-65.1); AUC was 0·89. All false negative cases were classified as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) by human grading. CONCLUSIONS: The DL algorithm reached a good diagnostic accuracy for more than mild DR in a real-world, high burden setting. The performance of the handheld portable retinal camera was adequate, with over 80% of individuals presenting with images of sufficient quality. Portable devices and artificial intelligence tools may increase coverage of DR screening programs.

AB  - Virtually all SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in clinical testing are stored in a refrigerated or frozen state prior to use. This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, several of them use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these nucleic-acid-based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, suggesting that a suitable RBD construct might serve as a more accessible vaccine ingredient. We describe a monomeric, glycan-engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 214 mg/l in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and, in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100 °C when lyophilized, up to 70 °C in solution and stable for over 4 weeks at 37 °C. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59-like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ∼415 against replicative virus, comparing favorably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic. These features of high yield, extreme thermotolerance, and satisfactory immunogenicity suggest that such RBD subunit vaccine formulations hold great promise to combat COVID-19.

AB  - Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is an emerging disease in children affected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and thought to be an immune-mediated post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2. The disease presentation is similar to Kawasaki disease but has certain distinguishing features. The exact pathogenesis is still not clear but an aberrant immune response, antibody-mediated vascular damage and virus-mediated abnormal type I and III interferon-gamma response are thought to be responsible. Most children who are previously healthy present after 2-4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infections with febrile illness of short duration with prominent gastrointestinal, cardiac and hematologic manifestations, progressing to vasoplegic shock, requiring vasopressor therapy. Cardiovascular involvement is prominently marked by acute myocardial injury/myocarditis and the development of coronary artery aneurysms. Laboratory markers of inflammation are elevated uniformly. Most children require intensive care, and few need invasive ventilation. The treatment mainly consists of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy like intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids. The overall prognosis is good and reported mortality rates are 0-4%.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) presenting with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations. The first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has rapidly progressed to the form of a pandemic. The presentation is mild in about 80 percent of the cases, but the disease can also progress to a severe form of respiratory illness leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes multi-organ failure, especially in people with other co-morbidities. Pregnant women also appear to be at a greater risk of acquiring a severe infection due to physiological changes during pregnancy. Many drugs with in vitro activity against the virus or an immunomodulatory effect have been considered for repurposing or have been tried as off-label drugs. The safety data regarding the use of newly approved or off-label or investigational drugs in pregnant women is limited and this poses a great challenge for clinicians. It is thus important to know the utility and safety of the medications to avoid untoward adverse effects on pregnant women and fetuses. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the approved, off-label, unlicensed, new and some promising medications for their use in the treatment of COVID-19 and the safety profile in pregnancy in an Indian scenario.

AB  - Due to non-availability of specific therapeutics against COVID-19, repurposing of approved drugs is a reasonable option. Cytokines imbalance in COVID-19 resembles cancer; exploration of anti-inflammatory agents, might reduce COVID-19 mortality. The current study investigates the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset. The protein-protein interaction network, biological process and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were studied using STRING App of the Cytoscape software and R programming tools. The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment elicited similar response equivalent to that of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by inducing defense response in host against virus infection by RLR and NOD like receptor pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as inhibition of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon- I and -II signalling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialnilFunding StatementNo funding source is relevant to this study.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Details are given in the manuscript related to analysis of publicly available dataset.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe a poly-vinyl chloride air condition (PVC AC) curtain shield placed at the intervening space between the chin rest and the illuminating and optical arm of the slit lamp microscope (distal barrier) instead of the present position at the oculars (proximal barrier) to guard against severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2. This experimental study was done to validate and compare the protection offered by the conventional breath shields and the one described by us in a simulated environment. Methods: In this experimental study, 12 puffs of fine mist were sprayed over a period of 1 minute using "magenta-colored dye" and "cyan-colored dye" for analyzing proximal barrier and distal barrier respectively. To access the amount of contamination of the slit lamp, caused by sprayed "magenta" and "cyan" colored dye, we covered the entire slit lamp with appropriately sized white-colored cotton sheet. The stained sheets were individually photographed and then the images were first cropped, then color threshold adjusted and then converted to binary and finally fraction of surface area stained was calculated using the ImageJ software. (Pn Surface Area magenta fraction (%) during analysis of "proximal barrier" and Pn Surface Area cyan fraction (%) during the analysis of "distal barrier", where Pn refers to various parts of slit lamp. Results: The entire surface area of the cloth covering the slit lamp was 9912.45 cm2. The surface area of the cloth which was stained when using the "proximal barrier" was 567.50 cm2 whereas when using the "distal barrier" was 222.93 cm2. When using proximal barrier, 97.71% of the staining was present on the slit lamp base, viewing arm, illumination arm and the pivot of the slit lamp. While using the distal breath shield no parts of the viewing arm, illumination arm, the pivot or the mechanical base with joystick were stained. Conclusion: The novel PVC AC curtain shield provides better barrier against the simulated contaminated stream of patient's breath directed towards the working parts of the slit lamp as compared to conventional slit lamp oculars mounted breath shields.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The new pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has produced a global tumult and has overburdened national health systems. We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 10-20% of cases with mild disease but in greater than 50-60% in severe cases, contributing to patients' demise. Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock. Off-label therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available. A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the renin--angiotensin system as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells. However, to-date, no harm has been proven for these drugs. SUMMARY: In the cardiovascular system, COVID-19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas anti-COVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular side-effects. Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidence-based guidelines.

AB  - Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 μm. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex® test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new elastometric respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of the new respirator over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators. As a universal masking policy is generally implemented, health care workers who are at risk must be protected with appropriate devices. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The Covid-19 crisis has clarified the demand for an ultra-brief single-session, online, theory-led, empirically supported, psychological intervention for managing stress and improving well-being, especially for people within organizational settings. We designed and delivered "4Ds for Dealing with Distress" during the crisis to address this need. 4Ds unifies a spectrum of familiar emotion regulation strategies, resilience exercises, and problem-solving approaches using perceptual control theory and distils them into a simple four-component rubric (Distract-Dilute-Develop-Discover). In essence, the aim is to reduce distress and restore wellbeing, both in the present moment through current actions (distract or dilute), and through expressing longer-term goal conflicts (e.g., through talking, writing, and drawing) to discover new perspectives that arise spontaneously after sufficient time and consideration. The intervention is user-led in that it draws on users' own idiosyncratic and pre-existing experiences, knowledge, skills and resources to help them apply an approach, or combination of approaches, that are proportionate and timed to the nature and context of the stress they are experiencing. In this article we review the empirical basis of the approach within experimental, social, biological and clinical psychology, illustrate the novel and time-efficient delivery format, describe its relevance to sports and exercise, summarise feedback from the recipients of the intervention to date, and describe the directions for future evaluation.

AB  - Tests used to diagnose illness commonly have imperfect accuracy, with some false-positive and negative results. For risk assessment and clinical decisions, predictive values are of interest. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a member of a relevant population who tests positive has been ill. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been ill. The medical literature regularly reports sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an ill person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a nonill person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity enables one to predict the test result given a person's illness status. These predictions are not directly relevant to patient care but, given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the population rate of illness. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of some diseases, a notable case being COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of identification of PPV and NPV given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity and given bounds on prevalence. I explain the problem and show how to bound PPV and NPV as well as the risk ratio and difference, which are functions thereof. I apply the findings to COVID-19 antibody tests. I question the realism of supposing that sensitivity and specificity are known.

AB  - The association of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with significant neurological and neuropsychiatric complications has been increasingly reported, both during the acute illness and in its aftermath. However, due to the short duration of patient follow up until now, it is not clear whether this infection will be associated with longer-term neurological and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. In particular, the question of whether COVID-19 will be associated with an increased risk and rate of future dementia remains open and subject to speculation. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients have reported sudden anosmia or other olfactory dysfunction as concurrent symptoms. The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may reach the brain via the olfactory nerve or an upper nasal trancribrial route is an interesting working hypothesis. Among the identified genetic risk factors for Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), Apo E4 is one of the strongest and most frequent. People carrying one or two copies of the e4 allele of Apo E4 have significant odor recognition deficits in comparison to those not carrying this haplotype. The hypothesis invoked in this paper is that anosmia/olfactory dysfunctions induced by SARS-CoV-2 may cause an increased a risk of future neurodegenerative dementia in ApoE4 carriers, and that this risk would be higher than in Apo E4 carriers affected by anosmia not induced by SARS-CoV-2. This would be associated with virus-induced chronic modifications in the central nervous system. It is proposed that COVID-19 patients with anosmia and no other serious symptoms should be followed up as part of specifically designed and approved studies in order to identify the early stages of dementia (especially LOAD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies), thereby improving our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in pre-cognitive stages of neurodegenerative dementia and making best use of any available therapies. This latter opportunity is unique and should not be lost.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread in humans in almost every country, causing the disease COVID-19. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, research efforts have been strongly directed towards obtaining a full understanding of the biology of the viral infection, in order to develop a vaccine and therapeutic approaches. In particular, structural studies have allowed to comprehend the molecular basis underlying the role of many of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and to make rapid progress towards treatment and preventive therapeutics. Despite the great advances that have been provided by these studies, many knowledge gaps on the biology and molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection still remain. Filling these gaps will be the key to tackle this pandemic, through development of effective treatments and specific vaccination strategies.

AB  - Armenia has been in a conflict with its neighbor, Azerbaijan, since 1988. Civilians in Tavush Province are regularly affected by ceasefire violations along the armed border with recent escalations further threatening the population's safety. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns regarding the mental health of border village residents in Armenia are prevalent. We present context-related factors of psychiatric illness, the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the state of mental health services in Armenia. We recommend directing greater attention towards the mental health status of civilians residing in conflict zones during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging virus that has caused significant human morbidity and mortality since its detection in late 2019. With the rapid emergence has come an unprecedented programme of vaccine development with at least 300 candidates under development. Ferrets have proven to be an appropriate animal model for testing safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines due to quantifiable virus shedding in nasal washes and oral swabs. Here we outline our efforts early in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak to propagate and characterise an Australian isolate of the virus in vitro and in an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium, as well as to demonstrate the susceptibility of domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) to SARS-CoV-2 infection following intranasal challenge.

AB  - In order to examine what lessons radiological emergency management may offer to the Covid-19 pandemic management and vice versa, a series of three online webinars were conducted with leading experts, scholars and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines essential for emergency management and long-term risk governance. The first webinar debated the lessons we are learning from the Covid-19 pandemic for radiological risk communication, the second explored issues around longer-term outcomes of a crisis and how to balance these with short-term actions whilst the third focused on the key challenges of the 'transition phase', using learning from Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima Daichii (2011) accidents. This paper reviews the discussion and provides valuable lessons for the radiation protection community. Results of the discussion indicated that: i) non-radiological and non-epidemiological consequences of emergencies, e.g. psychological (mental health), societal and economic, should not be underestimated; ii) multidisciplinary expertise is imperative for communication efforts and for effective emergency management, including decision-making in the application of protective measures; iii) stakeholder engagement, including the involvement of the potentially affected population, should be encouraged from an early stage and iv) trust is increased if policy-makers and main science agencies show a unified voice.

AB  - PURPOSE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prognostic performance of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and EuropePMC on 19 November 2020. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, defined as a combined endpoint of mortality, severity, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and need for intensive care unit care. Severity followed the included studies' criteria. RESULTS: There are 10 399 patients from 21 studies. Elevated LDH was present in 44% (34%-53%) of the patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that diabetes was correlated with elevated LDH (OR 1.01 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.02), p=0.038), but not age (p=0.710), male (p=0.068) and hypertension (p=0.969). Meta-analysis showed that elevated LDH was associated with composite poor outcome (OR 5.33 (95% CI 3.90 to 7.31), p<0.001; I2: 77.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that elevated LDH increased mortality (OR 4.22 (95% CI 2.49 to 7.14), p<0.001; I2: 89%). Elevated LDH has a sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.85), specificity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.78), positive likelihood ratio of 2.4 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.9), negative likelihood ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.55), diagnostic OR of 6 (95% CI 4 to 9) and area under curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.80). Elevated LDH would indicate a 44% posterior probability and non-elevated LDH would in indicate 11% posterior probability for poor prognosis. Meta-regression analysis showed that age, male, hypertension and diabetes did not contribute to the heterogeneity of the analyses. CONCLUSION: LDH was associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020221594.

AB  - Face masks have globally been accepted to be an effective protective tool to prevent bacterial and viral transmission, especially against indoor aerosol transmission. However, commercial face masks contain filters that are made of materials that are not capable of inactivating either SARS-CoV-2 or multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can infect other people even if they wear them because some viable viral or bacterial loads can escape from the masks. Furthermore, viral or bacterial contact transmission can occur after touching the mask, which constitutes an increasing source of contaminated biological waste. Additionally, bacterial pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pneumonia disease complex, and their resistance to antibiotics in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. In this regard, herein, we report the development of a non-woven face mask filter fabricated with a biofunctional coating of benzalkonium chloride that is capable of inactivating more than 99% of SARS-CoV-2 particles in one minute of contact, and the life-threatening methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (normalized antibacterial halos of 0.52 ± 0.04 and 0.72 ± 0.04, respectively). Nonetheless, despite the results obtained, further studies are needed to ensure the safety and correct use of this technology for the mass production and commercialization of this broad-spectrum antimicrobial face mask filter. Our novel protective non-woven face mask filter would be useful for many healthcare workers and researchers working in this urgent and challenging field.

AB  - Although transport into the nucleus mediated by the importin (IMP) α/β1-heterodimer is central to viral infection, small molecule inhibitors of IMPα/β1-dependent nuclear import have only been described and shown to have antiviral activity in the last decade. Their robust antiviral activity is due to the strong reliance of many different viruses, including RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV), on the IMPα/β1-virus interface. High-throughput compound screens have identified many agents that specifically target this interface. Of these, agents targeting IMPα/β1 directly include the FDA-approved macrocyclic lactone ivermectin, which has documented broad-spectrum activity against a whole range of viruses, including HIV-1, DENV1-4, ZIKV, West Nile virus (WNV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Ivermectin has thus far been tested in Phase III human clinical trials for DENV, while there are currently close to 80 trials in progress worldwide for SARS-CoV-2; preliminary results for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) as well as observational/retrospective studies are consistent with ivermectin affording clinical benefit. Agents that target the viral component of the IMPα/β1-virus interface include N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR), which specifically targets DENV/ZIKV/WNV non-structural protein 5 (NS5). 4-HPR has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of infection by DENV1-4, including in an antibody-dependent enhanced animal challenge model, as well as ZIKV, with Phase II clinical challenge trials planned. The results from rigorous RCTs will help determine the therapeutic potential of the IMPα/β1-virus interface as a target for antiviral development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In a context where there is no treatment for the current COVID-19 virus, the combination of self-care behaviours together with confinement, are strategies to decrease the risk of contagion and remain healthy. However, there are no self-care measures to screen self-care activities in general population and which, could be briefly in a lockdown situation. This research aims to build and validate a psychometric tool to screen self-care activities in general population. METHODS: Firstly, an exploratory factor analysis was performed in a sample of 226 participants to discover the underlying factorial structure and to reduce the number of items in the original tool into a significant pool of items related to self-care. Later a confirmatory factor analyses were performed in a new sample of 261 participants to test for the fit and goodness of factor solutions. Internal validity, reliability, and convergent validity between its score with perceived stress and psychological well-being measures were examined on this sample. RESULTS: The exploratory analyses suggested a four-factor solution, corresponding to health consciousness, nutrition and physical activity, sleep, and intra-personal and inter-personal coping skills (14 items). Then, the four-factor structure was confirmed as the best model fit for self-care activities. The tool demonstrated good reliability, predictive validity of individuals' perception of coping with COVID-19 lockdown, and convergent validity with well-being and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: This screening tool could be helpful to address future evaluations and interventions to promote healthy behaviours. Likewise, this tool can be targeted to specific population self-care's needs during a scalable situation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein-peptide interactions play a fundamental role in a wide variety of biological processes, such as cell signaling, regulatory networks, immune responses, and enzyme inhibition. Peptides are characterized by low toxicity and small interface areas; therefore, they are good targets for therapeutic strategies, rational drug planning and protein inhibition. Approximately 10% of the ethical pharmaceutical market is protein/peptide-based. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40% of protein interactions are mediated by peptides. Despite the fast increase in the volume of biological data, particularly on sequences and structures, there remains a lack of broad and comprehensive protein-peptide databases and tools that allow the retrieval, characterization and understanding of protein-peptide recognition and consequently support peptide design. RESULTS: We introduce Propedia, a comprehensive and up-to-date database with a web interface that permits clustering, searching and visualizing of protein-peptide complexes according to varied criteria. Propedia comprises over 19,000 high-resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank including structural and sequence information from protein-peptide complexes. The main advantage of Propedia over other peptide databases is that it allows a more comprehensive analysis of similarity and redundancy. It was constructed based on a hybrid clustering algorithm that compares and groups peptides by sequences, interface structures and binding sites. Propedia is available through a graphical, user-friendly and functional interface where users can retrieve, and analyze complexes and download each search data set. We performed case studies and verified that the utility of Propedia scores to rank promissing interacting peptides. In a study involving predicting peptides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 main protease, we showed that Propedia scores related to similarity between different peptide complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease are in agreement with molecular dynamics free energy calculation. CONCLUSIONS: Propedia is a database and tool to support structure-based rational design of peptides for special purposes. Protein-peptide interactions can be useful to predict, classifying and scoring complexes or for designing new molecules as well. Propedia is up-to-date as a ready-to-use webserver with a friendly and resourceful interface and is available at: https://bioinfo.dcc.ufmg.br/propedia.

AB  - The world of work is facing an ongoing pandemic and an economic downturn with severe effects worldwide. Workers trapped in precarious employment (PE), both formal and informal, are among those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we call attention to at least 5 critical ways that the consequences of the crisis among workers in PE will be felt globally: (a) PE will increase, (b) workers in PE will become more precarious, (c) workers in PE will face unemployment without being officially laid off, (d) workers in PE will be exposed to serious stressors and dramatic life changes that may lead to a rise in diseases of despair, and (e) PE might be a factor in deterring the control of or in generating new COVID-19 outbreaks. We conclude that what we really need is a new social contract, where the work of all workers is recognized and protected with adequate job contracts, employment security, and social protection in a new economy, both during and after the COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - The authorization for emergency use of a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been issued in diverse countries in December 2020, and additional vaccine candidates soon may be cleared for a similar emergency use. If it is reasonable to believe that in some Western countries most people may be vaccinated by the end of 2021, insufficient supplies, access inequities across countries, and deficiencies in enforcing the participatory engagement of communities will present important challenges for the achievement of sufficient vaccination coverage worldwide in less than 2-3 years. A possible strategy for bridging the gap until full vaccine deployment is based on the integration of improved non-pharmaceutical measures and recently authorized pharmaceutical interventions to reduce as much as possible hospitalizations and deaths in the coming months, when recurring infection peaks are expected.

AB  - This paper discusses the measures adopted by the Italian government to face the COVID-19 emergency after the first wave in March/April 2020. This study places these measures in light of the massive reform process based on the "managerialism" of healthcare, which started in the 1990s. These reforms, which were inspired by the ideas of 'New Public Management', introduced managerialism, regionalization and quasi-markets to the Italian National Health System. As a result, dramatic changes have been made in public healthcare, and the responsibility for healthcare was decentralized to regions, introducing a multi-level governance structure. The COVID-19 emergency has drawn the results of this approach into question. With the enactment of new decrees, the central government directly intervened in the management of the health system by introducing specific measures aiming to increase the number of hospital beds and personnel, which w previously downsized. We describe the main content of the new measures adopted to face the COVID-19 emergency and discuss how key points of the managerialization process in Italy are being questioned as a result of these measures. The COVID-19 emergency will likely redesign the trajectory of health reforms in Italy and other countries in Europe.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The past two decades have been marked by three epidemics linked to emerging coronaviruses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the existence of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and raised the question of the neuropathogenicity of coronaviruses. The aim of this review was to summarize the current data about neurological manifestations and diseases linked to human coronaviruses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Articles have been identified by searches of PubMed and Google scholar up to September 25, 2020, using a combination of coronavirus and neurology search terms and adding relevant references in the articles. RESULTS: We found five cohorts providing prevalence data of neurological symptoms among a total of 2533 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and articles focusing on COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations including a total of 580 patients. Neurological symptoms involved up to 73% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and were mostly headache, myalgias and impaired consciousness. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were mostly non-specific encephalopathies that represented between 13% and 40% of all neurological manifestations; post-infectious syndromes including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n=13), acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE, n=4), Bickerstaff's encephalitis (n=5), generalized myoclonus (n=3) and acute transverse myelitis (n=7); other encephalitis including limbic encephalitis (n=9) and miscellaneous encephalitis with variable radiologic findings (n=26); acute cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic strokes (between 1.3% and 4.7% of COVID-19 patients), hemorrhagic strokes (n=17), cerebral venous thrombosis (n=8) and posterior reversible encephalopathy (n=5). Peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations reported in COVID-19 were the following: Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=31) and variants including Miller Fisher syndrome (n=3), polyneuritis cranialis (n=2) and facial diplegia (n=2); isolated oculomotor neuropathy (n=6); critical illness myopathy (n=6). Neuropathological studies in COVID-19 patients demonstrated different patterns of CNS damage, mostly ischemic and hemorrhagic changes with few cases of inflammatory injuries. Only one case suggested SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in endothelial and neural cells. We found 10 case reports or case series describing 22 patients with neurological manifestations associated with other human coronaviruses. Among them we found four MERS patients with ADEM or Bickerstaff's encephalitis, two SARS patients with encephalitis who had a positive SARS-CoV PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, five patients with ischemic strokes associated with SARS, eight MERS patients with critical illness neuromyopathy and one MERS patient with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. An autopsy study on SARS-CoV patients demonstrated the presence of the virus in the brain of eight patients. CONCLUSION: The wide range of neurological manifestations and diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with multiple pathogenic pathways including post-infectious mechanisms, septic-associated encephalopathies, coagulopathy or endothelitis. There was no definite evidence to support direct neuropathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a member of a family of signaling proteins, was shown to serve as an entry factor and potentiate SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity in vitro. This cell surface receptor with its disseminated expression is important in angiogenesis, tumor progression, viral entry, axonal guidance, and immune function. NRP-1 is implicated in several aspects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection including possible spread through the olfactory bulb and into the central nervous system and increased NRP-1 RNA expression in lungs of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Up-regulation of NRP-1 protein in diabetic kidney cells hint at its importance in a population at risk of severe COVID-19. Involvement of NRP-1 in immune function is compelling, given the role of an exaggerated immune response in disease severity and deaths due to COVID-19. NRP-1 has been suggested to be an immune checkpoint of T cell memory. It is unknown whether involvement and up-regulation of NRP-1 in COVID-19 may translate into disease outcome and long-term consequences, including possible immune dysfunction. It is prudent to further research NRP-1 and its possibility of serving as a therapeutic target in SARS-CoV-2 infections. We anticipate that widespread expression, abundance in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, and the functionalities of NRP-1 factor into the multiple systemic effects of COVID-19 and challenges we face in management of disease and potential long-term sequelae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviour is when someone is awake, in a sitting, lying or reclining posture and is an independent risk factor for multiple causes of morbidity and mortality. A dose-response relationship has been demonstrated, whereby increasing sedentary time corresponds with increasing mortality rate. This study aimed to identify current levels of sedentary behaviour among General Practitioners (GPs), by examining and synthesising how sedentary behaviour has been measured in the primary care literature. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify studies relating to levels of sedentary behaviour among GPs. Searches were performed using Medline®, Embase®, PscycINFO, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, from inception of databases until January 2020, with a subsequent search of grey literature. Articles were assessed for quality and bias, with extraction of relevant data. RESULTS: The search criteria returned 1707 studies. Thirty four full texts were reviewed and 2 studies included in the final review. Both were cross-sectional surveys using self-reported estimation of sedentary time within the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Keohane et al. examined GP trainees and GP trainers in Ireland. 60% reported spending in excess of 7 h sitting each day, 24% between 4 and 7 h, and 16% less than or equal to 4 h. Suija et al. examined female GPs in Estonia. The mean reported daily sitting time was 6 h and 36 min, with 56% sitting for over 6 h per day. Both studies were of satisfactory methodological quality but had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of research examining current levels of sedentary behaviour among GPs. Objective data is needed to determine GPs' current levels of sedentary behaviour, particularly in light of the increase in remote consulting as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic is a major challenge for the health systems worldwide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is one of the most common complications of the COVID-19 infection. The activation of the coagulation system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. The development of lung coagulopathy involves thrombin generation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Unfractionated heparin and its recently introduced counterpart low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), are widely used anticoagulants with a variety of clinical indications allowing for limited and manageable physio-toxicologic side effects while the use of protamine sulfate, heparin's effective antidote, has made their use even safer. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is approved as intravenous thrombolytic treatment. The present narrative review discusses the use of heparin and tPA in the treatment of COVID-19-induced ARDS and their related potential physio-toxicologic side effects. The article is a quick review of articles on anticoagulation in COVID infection and the potential toxicologic reactions associated with these drugs.

AB  - Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have raised big interest in therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine and appear to fulfill the criteria for a successful cell therapy. Their low immunogenicity and their ability to self-renew, to differentiate into different tissue-specific progenitors, to migrate into damaged sites, and to act through autocrine and paracrine pathways have been altogether testified as the main mechanisms whereby cell repair and regeneration occur. The absence of standardization protocols in cell management within laboratories or facilities added to the new technologies improved at patient's bedside and the discrepancies in cell outcomes and engraftment increase the limitations on their widespread use by balancing their real benefit versus the patient safety and security. Also, comparisons across pooled patients are particularly difficult in the fact that multiple medical devices are used and there is absence of harmonized assessment assays despite meeting regulations agencies and efficient GMP protocols. Moreover, the emergence of the COVID-19 breakdown added to the complexity of implementing standardization. Cell- and tissue-based therapies are completely dependent on the biological manifestations and parameters associated to and induced by this virus where the scope is still unknown. The initial flow chart identified for stem cell therapies should be reformulated and updated to overcome patient infection and avoid significant variability, thus enabling more patient safety and therapeutic efficiency. The aim of this work is to highlight the major guidelines and differences in ADSC processing meeting the current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and the cellular therapy-related policies. Specific insights on standardization of ADSCs proceeding at different check points are also presented as a setup for the cord blood and bone marrow.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over 70 million people worldwide, including those with neurodegenerative disease (NDD), have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to date. We review outcomes in patients with NDD and COVID-19 and discuss the hypothesis that due to putative commonalities of neuropathogenesis, COVID-19 may unmask or trigger NDD in vulnerable individuals. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on a systematic review of published literature, patients with NDD, including dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) make up a significant portion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Such patients are likely to present with altered mental status or worsening of their preexisting neurological symptoms. Patients with NDD and poor outcomes often have high-risk comorbid conditions, including advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart/lung disease. Patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death, whereas those with preexisting Parkinson's disease are not. MS patients have good outcomes and disease modifying therapies do not increase the risk for severe disease. Viral infections and attendant neuroinflammation have been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and MS, suggesting that COVID-19 may have the potential to incite or accelerate neurodegeneration. SUMMARY: Since patients with Alzheimer's disease are at higher risk for hospitalization and death in the setting of COVID-19, additional precautions and protective measures should be put in place to prevent infections and optimize management of comorbidities in this vulnerable population. Further studies are needed to determine whether COVID-19 may lead to an increased risk of developing NDD in susceptible individuals.

AB  - Emotional eating, generally defined as (over)-eating in response to negative emotions, has been associated with poor physical and psychological outcomes. During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19. We discuss how these findings should be applied, and recommendations for future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 exposes major gaps in the MCH safety net and illuminates the disproportionate consequences borne by people living in low resource communities where systemic racism, community disinvestment, and social marginalization creates a perfect storm of vulnerability. METHODS: We draw eight lessons from the first 8 months of the pandemic, describing how COVID-19 has intensified pre-existing gaps in the MCH support network and created new problems. For each lesson identified, we present supporting evidence and a call for specific actions that can be taken by MCH practitioners, researchers and advocates. RESULTS: LESSON #1: COVID-19 hits communities of color hardest, exposing and exacerbating health inequities caused by systemic racism. LESSON #2: Women experience the most devastating social, economic and mental health tolls during COVID-19. LESSON #3: Virulent pathogens find and exacerbate cracks in our public health and health care systems. LESSON #4: COVID-19 has become a pretext to limit access to sexual and reproductive health care. LESSON #5: COVID-19 has exposed and deepened fault lines in maternity care: over-medicalization, discrimination, lack of workforce diversity, underutilization of collaborative team approaches, and lack of post-delivery follow-up. LESSON #6: The pandemic adds impetus to much-needed Medicaid policy reforms that can have a lasting positive effect on maternal health. LESSON #7: Social and health policy changes, heretofore deemed infeasible, ARE possible under pandemic threat. LESSON #8: Finally, an overarching COVID-19 lesson: We are all inextricably connected. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a loud wake up call for renewed action by MCH epidemiologists, policy-makers, and advocates.

AB  - Weather and climate play a significant role in infectious disease transmission, through changes to transmission dynamics, host susceptibility and virus survival in the environment. Exploring the association of weather variables and COVID-19 transmission is vital in understanding the potential for seasonality and future outbreaks and developing early warning systems. Previous research examined the effects of weather on COVID-19, but the findings appeared inconsistent. This review aims to summarize the currently available literature on the association between weather and COVID-19 incidence and provide possible suggestions for developing weather-based early warning system for COVID-19 transmission. Studies eligible for inclusion used ecological methods to evaluate associations between weather (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed and rainfall) and COVID-19 transmission. The review showed that temperature was reported as significant in the greatest number of studies, with COVID-19 incidence increasing as temperature decreased and the highest incidence reported in the temperature range of 0-17 °C. Humidity was also significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence, though the reported results were mixed, with studies reporting positive and negative correlation. A significant interaction between humidity and temperature was also reported. Wind speed and rainfall results were not consistent across studies. Weather variables including temperature and humidity can contribute to increased transmission of COVID-19, particularly in winter conditions through increased host susceptibility and viability of the virus. While there is less indication of an association with wind speed and rainfall, these may contribute to behavioral changes that decrease exposure and risk of infection. Understanding the implications of associations with weather variables and seasonal variations for monitoring and control of future outbreaks is essential for early warning systems.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading across the world has led to surges of COVID-19 illness, hospitalizations, and death. The complex and multifaceted pathophysiology of life-threatening COVID-19 illness including viral mediated organ damage, cytokine storm, and thrombosis warrants early interventions to address all components of the devastating illness. In countries where therapeutic nihilism is prevalent, patients endure escalating symptoms and without early treatment can succumb to delayed in-hospital care and death. Prompt early initiation of sequenced multidrug therapy (SMDT) is a widely and currently available solution to stem the tide of hospitalizations and death. A multipronged therapeutic approach includes 1) adjuvant nutraceuticals, 2) combination intracellular anti-infective therapy, 3) inhaled/oral corticosteroids, 4) antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants, 5) supportive care including supplemental oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Randomized trials of individual, novel oral therapies have not delivered tools for physicians to combat the pandemic in practice. No single therapeutic option thus far has been entirely effective and therefore a combination is required at this time. An urgent immediate pivot from single drug to SMDT regimens should be employed as a critical strategy to deal with the large numbers of acute COVID-19 patients with the aim of reducing the intensity and duration of symptoms and avoiding hospitalization and death.

AB  - In addition to providing life-giving nutrients and other substances to the breastfed infant, human milk can also represent a vehicle of pathogen transfer. As such, when an infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic occurs-particularly when it is associated with a novel pathogen-the question will naturally arise as to whether the pathogen can be transmitted through breastfeeding. Until high-quality data are generated to answer this question, abandonment of breastfeeding due to uncertainty can result. The COVID-19 pandemic, which was in full swing at the time this document was written, is an excellent example of this scenario. During these times of uncertainty, it is critical for investigators conducting research to assess the possible transmission of pathogens through milk, whether by transfer through the mammary gland or contamination from respiratory droplets, skin, breast pumps, and milk containers, and/or close contact between mother and infant. To promote the most rigorous science, it is critical to outline optimal methods for milk collection, handling, storage, and analysis in these situations, and investigators should openly share their methods in published materials. Otherwise, the risks of inconsistent test results from preanalytical and analytical variation, false positives, and false negatives are unacceptably high and the ability to provide public health guidance poor. In this study, we provide "best practices" for collecting human milk samples for COVID-19 research with the intention that this will also be a useful guide for future pandemics.

AB  - In her 2018 book, What the Eyes Don't See, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha wrote that it is the duty of doctors to speak out against injustice. In fact, no other physician or institution in Flint had done the research and spoken out, as a whistleblower, against the poisoning of Flint's children by Michigan government. Why had Dr. Hannah-Attisha? Unfortunately, in the absence of a medical education system that teaches community-oriented primary health care in the tradition of the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration, there is little reward in doing so. This article focuses on three movements that are challenging medical education orthodoxy: 1) primary health care 2) the medical humanities and 3) "Study Up your Town" medicine. How can we create a radical health pedagogy - one that draws the links between several pandemics raging across the planet: capitalist collapse, climate disruption, Covid-19, racism, and an emergent neoliberal fascism - to enable doctors, health professionals and citizens to see them as all of one piece? Medical educators must employ critical pedagogy to create legions of "constructive troublemakers" who challenge the social-structural obstacles that are driving millions to premature death. We have reached the "end times." A new "planet medicine" is finally emerging.

We reflect critically on the leadership and management activities of boards to understand the implications of the current crisis on governance. Employing a contingency approach to governance, we present a model of boards of directors' leadership and management roles under four governance configurations as organizations navigate through the stages of the pandemic. We suggest that organizations with governance configurations that are more suited to predictable environments will generally experience greater shifts between management and leadership activities as they move through the stages of the COVID-19 crisis.

This review summarizes the literature on diagnosis, parameters of disease severity, and current treatment regimens. The clinical perspective was analyzed in light of potential immunopathogenesis and compared to other post-infectious and inflammatory illnesses of children affecting the heart. In this paradigm, the evidence supports the importance of endothelial injury and activation of the IL-1 pathway as a common determinant among MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and Acute Rheumatic fever.

AB  - The global trading system has undergone a shift away from multilateral trade negotiations to a 'spaghetti-bowl' of regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). In this two-part glossary, we discuss why this shift has occurred, focusing on how it poses new challenges for public health. Specifically, we introduce key terms that shape this new trading environment and explain them through a public health lens. Part 1 of this glossary focuses on provisions in FTAs that build on previous agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO). These provisions are commonly designated as 'WTO-Plus'. This approach continues into part 2 of the glossary, which also considers components of FTAs that have no precedent within WTO treaties. Following a broader discussion of how the current political context and the COVID-19 pandemic shape the contemporary trade environment, part 2 considers the main areas of trade and health policy incoherence as well as recommendations to address them.

AB  - Part 1 of this glossary provided a brief background on the rise of regional/bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) and described the health implications of new trade obligations that figure prominently in current and recent trade negotiations, focusing on those provisions that build on previous agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This approach continues into part 2 of the glossary, which also considers components of FTAs that have no precedent within WTO treaties. Following a broader discussion of how the current political context and the COVID-19 pandemic shape the contemporary trade environment, part 2 considers the main areas of trade and health policy incoherence as well as recommendations to address them.

AB  - A Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay was used to screen the FDA-approved compound library against the MERS-CoV helicase, an essential enzyme for virus replication within the host cell. Five compounds inhibited the helicase activity with submicromolar potencies (IC50, 0.73-1.65 µM) and ten compounds inhibited the enzyme with micromolar potencies (IC50, 19.6-502 µM). The molecular operating environment (MOE) was used to dock the identified inhibitors on the MERS-CoV helicase nucleotide binding. Strong inhibitors docked well in the nucleotide-binding site and established interactions with some of the essential residues. There was a reasonable correlation between the observed IC50 values and the MOE docking scores of the strong inhibitors (r2 = 0.74), indicating the ability of the in silico docking model to predict the binding of strong inhibitors. In silico docking could be a useful complementary tool used with the FRET-based assay to predict new MERS-CoV helicase inhibitors. The identified inhibitors could potentially be used in the clinical development of new antiviral treatment for MERS-CoV and other coronavirus related diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - Protein-nucleic acid interactions play essential roles in many biological processes, such as transcription, replication and translation. In protein-nucleic acid interfaces, hotspot residues contribute the majority of binding affinity toward molecular recognition. Hotspot residues are commonly regarded as potential binding sites for compound molecules in drug design projects. The dynamic property is a considerable factor that affects the binding of ligands. Computational approaches have been developed to expedite the prediction of hotspot residues on protein-nucleic acid interfaces. However, existing approaches overlook hotspot dynamics, despite their essential role in protein function. Here, we report a web server named Hotspots In silico Scanning on Nucleic Acid and Protein Interface (HISNAPI) to analyze hotspot residue dynamics by integrating molecular dynamics simulation and one-step free energy perturbation. HISNAPI is capable of not only predicting the hotspot residues in protein-nucleic acid interfaces but also providing insights into their intensity and correlation of dynamic motion. Protein dynamics have been recognized as a vital factor that has an effect on the interaction specificity and affinity of the binding partners. We applied HISNAPI to the case of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a vital target of the antiviral drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. We identified the hotspot residues and characterized their dynamic behaviors, which might provide insight into the target site for antiviral drug design. The web server is freely available via a user-friendly web interface at http://chemyang.ccnu.edu.cn/ccb/server/HISNAPI/ and http://agroda.gzu.edu.cn:9999/ccb/server/HISNAPI/.

AB  - Absent pharmaceutical interventions, social distancing, lock-downs and mobility restrictions remain our prime response in the face of epidemic outbreaks. To ease their potentially devastating socioeconomic consequences, we propose here an alternating quarantine strategy: at every instance, half of the population remains under lockdown while the other half continues to be active - maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime minimizes infectious interactions, as it allows only half of the population to interact for just half of the time. As a result it provides a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achieved by a population-wide lockdown, despite sustaining socioeconomic continuity at ~50% capacity. The weekly alternations also help address the specific challenge of COVID-19, as their periodicity synchronizes with the natural SARS-CoV-2 disease time-scales, allowing to effectively isolate the majority of infected individuals precisely at the time of their peak infection.

AB  - This study represents the first empirical estimation of threshold values between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and COVID-19-related deaths in France. The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 μg/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 μg/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 μg/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 μg/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), termed COVID-19, has been highlighted as the most important infectious disease of our time, without a vaccine and treatment available until this moment, with a big impact on health systems worldwide, and with high mortality rates associated with respiratory viral disease. The medical and scientific communities have also been confronted by an urgent need to better understand the mechanism of host-virus interaction aimed at developing therapies and vaccines. Since this viral disease can trigger a strong innate immune response, causing severe damage to the pulmonary tract, immunotherapies have also been explored as a means to verify the immunomodulatory effect and improve clinical outcomes, whilst the comprehensive COVID-19 immunology still remains under investigation. In this review, both cellular and molecular immunopathology as well as hemostatic disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. The immunotherapeutic approaches based on the most recent clinical and nonclinical studies, emphasizing their effects for the treatment of COVID-19, are also addressed. The information presented elucidates helpful insights aiming at filling the knowledge gaps around promising immunotherapies that attempt to control the dysfunction of host factors during the course of this infectious viral disease.

AB  - As of 8 January 2021, there were 86,749,940 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 1,890,342 COVID-19-related deaths worldwide, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In order to address the COVID-19 pandemic by limiting transmission, an intense global effort is underway to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The development of a safe and effective vaccine usually requires several years of pre-clinical and clinical stages of evaluation and requires strict regulatory approvals before it can be manufactured in bulk and distributed. Since the global impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented in the modern era, the development and testing of a new vaccine are being expedited. Given the high-level of attrition during vaccine development, simultaneous testing of multiple candidates increases the probability of finding one that is effective. Over 200 vaccines are currently in development, with over 60 candidate vaccines being tested in clinical trials. These make use of various platforms and are at different stages of development. This review discusses the different phases of vaccine development and the various platforms in use for candidate COVID-19 vaccines, including their progress to date. The potential challenges once a vaccine becomes available are also addressed.

AB  - Covid-19 has rapidly redefined the agenda of technological research and development both for academics and practitioners. If the medical scientific publication system has promptly reacted to this new situation, other domains, particularly in new technologies, struggle to map what is happening in their contexts. The pandemic has created the need for a rapid detection of technological convergence phenomena, but at the same time it has made clear that this task is impossible on the basis of traditional patent and publication indicators. This paper presents a novel methodology to perform a rapid detection of the fast technological convergence phenomenon that is occurring under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fast detection has been performed thanks to the use of a novel source: the online blogging platform Medium. We demonstrate that the hybrid structure of this social journalism platform allows a rapid detection of innovation phenomena, unlike other traditional sources. The technological convergence phenomenon has been modelled through a network-based approach, analysing the differences of networks computed during two time periods (pre and post COVID-19). The results led us to discuss the repurposing of technologies regarding "Remote Control", "Remote Working", "Health" and "Remote Learning".

AB  - The area of mental health is directly affected by the pandemic and its consequences, for various reasons: 1-the pandemic triggered a global lockdown, with dramatic socioeconomic and therefore psychosocial implications; 2-mental health services, which treat by definition a fragile population from the psychological, biological and social points of view, have a complex organizational frame, and it was expected that this would be affected (or overwhelmed) by the pandemic; 3-mental health services should, at least in theory, be able to help guide public health policies when these involve a significant modification of individual behaviour. It was conducted a narrative review of the publications produced by European researchers in the period February-June 2020 and indexed in PubMed. A total of 34 papers were analyzed, which document the profound clinical, organizational and procedural changes introduced in mental health services following this exceptional and largely unforeseen planetary event.Among the main innovations recorded everywhere, the strong push towards the use of telemedicine techniques should be mentioned: however, these require an adequate critical evaluation, which highlights their possibilities, limits, advantages and disadvantages instead of simple triumphalist judgments. Furthermore, should be emphasized the scarcity of quantitative studies conducted in this period and the absence of studies aimed, for example, at exploring the consequences of prolonged and forced face-to-face contact between patients and family members with a high index of "expressed emotions".

AB  - Persistence of symptoms or development of new symptoms relating to SARS-CoV-2 infection late in the course of COVID-19 is an increasingly recognised problem facing the globally infected population and its health systems. 'Long-COVID' or 'COVID long-haulers' generally describes those persons with COVID-19 who experience symptoms for &gt;28 days after diagnosis, whether laboratory confirmed or clinical. Symptoms are as markedly heterogeneous as seen in acute COVID-19 and may be constant, fluctuate, or appear and be replaced by symptoms relating to other systems with varying frequency. Such multisystem involvement requires a holistic approach to management of long-COVID, and descriptions of cohorts from low- and middle-income countries are eagerly awaited. Although many persons with long-COVID will be managed in primary care, others will require greater input from rehabilitation medicine experts. For both eventualities, planning is urgently required to ensure that the South African public health service is ready and able to respond.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) presents with progressive dyspnea, which results from acute lung inflammatory edema leading to hypoxia. As with other infectious diseases that affect the respiratory tract, asthma has been cited as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, conflicting results have been published over the last few months and the putative association between these two diseases is still unproven. METHODS: Here, we systematically reviewed all reports on COVID-19 published since its emergence in December 2019 to June 30, 2020, looking into the description of asthma as a premorbid condition, which could indicate its potential involvement in disease progression. RESULTS: We found 372 articles describing the underlying diseases of 161,271 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Asthma was reported as a premorbid condition in only 2623 patients accounting for 1.6% of all patients. CONCLUSIONS: As the global prevalence of asthma is 4.4%, we conclude that either asthma is not a premorbid condition that contributes to the development of COVID-19 or clinicians and researchers are not accurately describing the premorbidities in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Objective: Vision loss has a significant impact on physical, mental and social well-being. Eye clinic liaison officers (ECLOs) have a crucial role in providing holistic care for patients with visual impairment. The aim of this study was to review the work of an ECLO over a period of 1 year at an NHS Trust to determine the volume of work and the areas of support provided by the ECLO. Methods and Analysis: A secondary data analysis of the ECLO case notes for all patients reviewed by the ECLO at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust during the year 2019, was performed. Demographic data and certification of visual impairment (CVI) status were noted. The main outcome variable recorded was the categories of support provided by the ECLO. Case vignettes were chosen to illustrate the variety of support offered to individual patients. Results: A total of 1127 consecutive participants were reviewed by the ECLO at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust during the year 2019. Areas of support most commonly provided by the ECLO included aiding the process of registration for CVI, and assistance in accessing benefits, social support and low vision support. Severely sight impaired patients required significantly more areas of support than sight impaired patients (Χ2=52.7, p=2.16×10-6). Three case vignettes, chosen by the ECLO, highlighted the positive impact of the ECLO with respect to emotional support, practical advice and as a point of contact ensuring continuity of care, also during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The ECLO at UHB NHS Trust provides a core patient service within the ophthalmology department by being a key source of practical and emotional support and the crucial link between healthcare, social care and voluntary services.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) affects several organs including the kidneys. When examining patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, it is important to consider the circadian rhythm because in addition to its biological clock function, disruption of the circadian rhythm has been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of several disorders, including AKI. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), displays circadian rhythmicity. Studies have shown that over-expression of human ACE2 increases the replication of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to disruptions and tissue damage due to the suppression of the brain and muscle ARNT-like protein-1(Bmal1) gene and high pro-inflammatory cytokines expressions in the tissues. Therefore, understanding and regulating the circadian rhythm and expression pattern of the key components of RAAS can prevent or reduce the severity of acute kidney injury that may occur with COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Background: Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) is a large tertiary care center in the Bronx, New York City, with 245 internal medicine residents. Beginning on February 29, 2020, residents became ill with COVID-19-like illness (CLI), which required absence from work. There was initially a shortage of personal protective equipment and delays in SARS-CoV-2 testing, which gradually improved during March and April 2020. Objective: We evaluated the relationship between CLI-related work absence rates of internal medicine residents and MMC's COVID-19 hospital census over time. Methods: Data on resident work absence between February 29 and May 22 were reviewed along with MMC's COVID-19 hospital census data. To determine the effect of patient exposure on resident CLI incidence, we compared the mean incidence of CLI per patient exposure days (PED = daily hospital census × days pre- or post-peak) before and after peak COVID-19 hospital census. Results: Forty-two percent (103 of 245) of internal medicine residents were absent from work, resulting in 875 missed workdays. At the peak of resident work absence, 16% (38 of 245) were out sick. Residents were absent for a median of 7 days (IQR 6-9.5 days). Mean resident CLI incidence per PED (CLI/PED) was 13.9-fold lower post-peak compared to pre-peak (P = .003). Conclusions: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, a large portion of internal medicine residents at this single center became ill. However, the incidence of CLI decreased over time, despite ongoing exposure to patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an unprecedented response from clinicians and the scientific community in all relevant biomedical fields. This created an incredible multidimensional data-rich framework in which deep learning proved instrumental to make sense of the data and build models used in prediction-validation workflows that in a matter of months have already produced results in assessing the spread of the outbreak, its taxonomy, population susceptibility, in diagnostics or drug discovery and repurposing. More is expected to come in the near future from using such advanced machine learning techniques in combating this pandemic. This review is aimed to uncover just a small fraction of this large global endeavor by focusing on the research performed on the main COVID-19 targets, on the computational weaponry used in identifying drugs to combat the disease, and on some of the most important directions found in confronting COVID-19 or alleviating its symptoms in the absence of vaccines or specific medication.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged professors and students of all disciplines to adjust quickly to remote online teaching and education platforms. In this new era of remote teaching, a greater challenge has been presented in the field of equine science; how to effectively share knowledge that is most often demonstrated by providing students access to live, in-person animal examples. Historically, students and teachers believed skill sets, which are vital for future careers in the industry (e.g., veterinarian) must be learned through hands-on experience. However, in-person methods were not available, so students were taught through the Zoom platform. Students enrolled in various levels of equine science classes were invited to complete a short voluntary questionnaire measuring their response and perception to equine courses taught in an entirely online remote setting by the same professor. One group was comprised of undergraduates majoring in the field (n = 44) in upper level equine science courses, Advanced Equine Reproduction Physiology and/or Equine Enterprise. These students, 41 females and 3 males, ranged in age from 20 to 25 yr, were provided a voluntary questionnaire seeking responses related to the perceived effectiveness and individual preferences of in-class lectures and in-person labs vs. remote online teaching practices. A similar questionnaire was offered on a volunteer basis to precollege students (n = 17). These students, female, high-school students from freshman to senior status (14-18 yr of age), were interested in equine science as a major at UC Davis in the future. This questionnaire evaluated their response to a 2-week remote synchronous online equine science course, which included multiple teaching methods, including lectures, mini labs, and full labs. Responses from both populations suggested that equine courses were perceived as effective when offered as online, remote courses. Live (synchronous) classes and labs offered on Zoom increased engagement and interaction, but students also appreciated the opportunity to access recorded materials. Students responded positively to online remote teaching and found courses to be effective for increasing their knowledge about equine science in an engaging manner, despite their continued preference for in-person instruction.

AB  - The first reported receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on host cells was the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the viral spike protein also has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and identified candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton, and cell signaling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates and may interact with the μ2 subunit of the endocytosis-associated AP2 adaptor complex, as well as with various protein domains (namely, I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB, and SH2) found in human signaling and regulatory proteins. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, such as in response to tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are present in the tails of integrin β3 and ACE2, suggesting that these proteins could directly recruit autophagy components. Our findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression. Several of these SLiMs have now been validated to mediate the predicted peptide interactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation of a virtual, multi-institutional educational collaboration involving over 50 general surgery residency programs during the COVID-19 pandemic that enabled enhanced learning for surgical residents despite social-distancing requirements. DESIGN: Description of Virginia Commonwealth University's virtual educational augmentation program and the development of a collaborative teaching network during the coronavirus pandemic. SETTING: This collaboration was initiated by Virginia Commonwealth University's Department of Surgery, Richmond, VA, and grew to include general surgery residency programs from across the nation. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents and faculty from Departments of General Surgery were recruited locally via direct emails and nationally via the Association of Program Directors' listserv and Twitter. In total, 52 institutions participated from every part of the country. RESULTS: A virtual, multi-institutional collaborative lecture series was initiated that grew to involve over 50 general surgery residency programs, allowing for daily didactics by experts in their fields during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining social distancing and the provision of essential clinical care. CONCLUSION: A multi-institutional collaboration enabled continued didactic education during the coronavirus pandemic, vastly broadening the expertise, scope and variety available to residents, while decreasing burden on faculty. We believe this can serve as a framework for future multi-institutional collaborations that extend beyond the COVID-19 era.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This article outlines a four-part strategy for future research in mental health and complementary disciplines that will broaden understanding of mass shootings and multi-victim gun homicides. First, researchers must abandon the starting assumption that acts of mass violence are driven primarily by diagnosable psychopathology in isolated "lone wolf" individuals. The destructive motivations must be situated, instead, within larger social structures and cultural scripts. Second, mental health professionals and scholars must carefully scrutinize any apparent correlation of violence with mental illness for evidence of racial bias in the official systems that define, measure, and record psychiatric diagnoses, as well as those that enforce laws and impose criminal justice sanctions. Third, to better understand the role of firearm access in the occurrence and lethality of mass shootings, research should be guided by an overarching framework that incorporates social, cultural, legal, and political, but also psychological, aspects of private gun ownership in the United States. Fourth, effective policies and interventions to reduce the incidence of mass shootings over time-and to prevent serious acts of violence more generally-will require an expanded body of well-funded interdisciplinary research that is informed and implemented through the sustained engagement of researchers with affected communities and other stakeholders in gun violence prevention. Emerging evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has produced a sharp increase both in civilian gun sales and in the social and psychological determinants of injurious behavior adds special urgency to this agenda.

AB  - During this time of global health crisis, physical distancing, along with mask wearing, has emerged as the sine qua non social practice to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19. But as physical distancing ensues and all eyes remain fixed on the novel coronavirus, another, albeit careworn, pandemic rages on. Physical inactivity, the world's fourth leading cause of death, may indeed be exacerbated by physical distancing measures, such as sheltering at home and closing or limiting access to recreation and exercise facilities. The purpose of this paper is to urge public health and medical professionals not to forget the importance of physical activity to whole-person health, recognize the importance of physical activity as a potential COVID-19 mitigation strategy and to serve as advocates for promoting active lifestyles. It is imperative that the national call for physical distancing not be interpreted as a call for physical inactivity.

AB  - On 19 March 2020, I last met with a group of women from a neighbourhood of Monterrey, Mexico where I have spent the past year conducting ethnographic research. They had scheduled a meeting to decide whether to continue our weekly talks on health-related topics. 'Is this coronavirus real?' was the question guiding the meeting. Women shared their thoughts on their feelings on the threat that predominates in biomedical discourse. An air of resignation pervaded their speech. Nearly all of them suffer from chronic diseases and they clearly perceive the risk of their own death. However, the material conditions of their lives limit the scope of their strategies to protect themselves. A dialogue emerged between the women's request for clarity regarding the pandemic and me, a researcher called on as a physician. This article seeks to reflect on the political and moral aspects of everyday life that configure risk perception in the context of the WHO-declared pandemic. I analyse the dialogue sustained in the meeting as part of an ethnographic research I am conducting in this neighbourhood. Most of its residents live under precarious circumstances, which is a fundamental element in understanding their responses to the current COVID-19 crisis.

AB  - Autophagy acts as a cellular surveillance mechanism to combat invading pathogens. Viruses have evolved various strategies to block autophagy and even subvert it for their replication and release. Here, we demonstrated that ORF3a of the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy activity by blocking fusion of autophagosomes/amphisomes with lysosomes. The late endosome-localized ORF3a directly interacts with and sequestrates the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) component VPS39, thereby preventing HOPS complex from interacting with the autophagosomal SNARE protein STX17. This blocks assembly of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE complex, which mediates autophagosome/amphisome fusion with lysosomes. Expression of ORF3a also damages lysosomes and impairs their function. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection blocks autophagy, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes/amphisomes, and causes late endosomal sequestration of VPS39. Surprisingly, ORF3a from the SARS virus SARS-CoV fails to interact with HOPS or block autophagy. Our study reveals a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades lysosomal destruction and provides insights for developing new strategies to treat COVID-19.

AB  - Telemedicine and remote visits are becoming more and more popular in several medical disciplines, including oncology. The Covid-19 pandemic has enhanced the need to continue to meet patients' ambulatory care necessities ensuring social distancing and limiting the access to clinical facilities. The National Cancer Institute of Aviano, Italy, has recently launched a program called "Doctor @ Home" (D@H). The pillars of the program are the co-production of the oncological care and the co-learning approach, which sees the clinical staff "hand in hand" with patients to maximize the outcome of the care, trying to take advantage of the new tools offered by modern technologies.

AB  - The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a challenge worldwide. Due to the characteristics of lung function tests, the risk of cross infection may be high between health care workers and patients. The role of lung function testing is well defined for the diagnosis of various diseases and conditions. Lung function tests are also indispensable in evaluating the response to medical treatment, in monitoring patient respiratory and systemic pathologies, and in evaluating preoperative risk in cardiothoracic and major abdominal surgeries. However, lung function testing represents a potential route for COVID-19 transmission, due to the aerosol generated during the procedures and the concentration of patients with pulmonary diseases in lung function laboratories. Currently, the opportunities for COVID-19 transmission remain partially unknown, and data are continuously evolving. This review provides useful information on the risks and recommendations for lung function testing, which have varied according to the phase of the pandemic. This information may support national and regional boards and the health authorities to which they belong. There is a need for rapid re-opening of lung function laboratories, but maximum safety is required in the COVID-19 era.

AB  - A series of 7-deazaadenine ribonucleosides bearing alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, or hetaryl groups at position 7 as well as their 5'-O-triphosphates and two types of monophosphate prodrugs (phosphoramidates and S-acylthioethanol esters) were prepared and tested for antiviral activity against selected RNA viruses (Dengue, Zika, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile, and SARS-CoV-2). The modified triphosphates inhibited the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases at micromolar concentrations through the incorporation of the modified nucleotide and stopping a further extension of the RNA chain. 7-Deazaadenosine nucleosides bearing ethynyl or small hetaryl groups at position 7 showed (sub)micromolar antiviral activities but significant cytotoxicity, whereas the nucleosides bearing bulkier heterocycles were still active but less toxic. Unexpectedly, the monophosphate prodrugs were similarly or less active than the corresponding nucleosides in the in vitro antiviral assays, although the bis(S-acylthioethanol) prodrug 14h was transported to the Huh7 cells and efficiently released the nucleoside monophosphate.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 induces a muted innate immune response compared to other respiratory viruses. Mitochondrial dynamics might partially mediate this effect of SARS-CoV-2 on innate immunity. Polypeptides encoded by open reading frames of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to localize to mitochondria and disrupt Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling (MAVS) protein signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 would distinctly regulate the mitochondrial transcriptome. We analyzed multiple publicly available RNASeq data derived from primary cells, cell lines, and clinical samples (i.e., BALF and lung). We report that SARS-CoV-2 did not dramatically regulate (1) mtDNA-encoded gene expression or (2) MAVS expression, and (3) SARS-CoV-2 downregulated nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NEM) genes related to cellular respiration and Complex I.

AB  - Massive molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is mandatory to manage the spread of COVID-19. Diagnostic screening should be performed at a mass scale, extended to the asymptomatic population, and repeated over time. An accurate diagnostic pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 that could massively increase the laboratory efficiency, while being sustainable in terms of time and costs, should be based on a pooling strategy. In the past few months, researchers from different disciplines had this same idea: test groups, not individuals. This critical review intends to highlight both the general consents-even if the results from different publications have been obtained with different protocols-and the points of disagreement that are creating some interpretative/comprehension difficulties. Different pooling schemes and technical aspects associated to the type of pooling adopted are described and discussed. We hope that this review can consolidate information to support researchers in designing optimized COVID-19 testing protocols based on pooling.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the first cases of COVID-19 associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were described in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since then, it has spread rapidly affecting 188 countries and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Preliminary reports suggest up to 30% of patients require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and case fatality rate estimate is 2.3%-7.2%. The primary reason for ICU admission is hypoxaemic respiratory failure, while factors associated with ICU admission include increased age, presence of comorbidities and cytokine storm. Case series and retrospective trials initially assessed proposed treatments with randomised controlled trials now reporting early outcomes. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify epidemiological factors, treatments and complications that predict mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our comprehensive search strategy was developed in consultation with a research librarian. We will search electronic databases: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Wiley Cochrane Library. The search strategy combines concepts from COVID-19, validated COVID-19 search filters and geographical locations of large outbreaks. Citation screening, selection, quality assessment and data abstraction will be performed in duplicate. Clinically homogenous epidemiological characteristics, interventions and complications will be pooled in statistical meta-analysis. Within the framework of a living systematic review, the search and data analysis will be updated every 6 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Our systematic review will synthesise literature on risk factors and interventions associated with mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Results will be presented at national and international conferences and submitted for peer-reviewed publication. The pooled analysis can provide guidance to inform clinical guidelines for care of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Iterative updates will be made public through open access. Research ethics approval is not required. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020176672.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective, but enough efficient solution for locating, tracking and distribution analysis of people and/or vehicle flowing, based on non-intrusive Bluetooth sensing and selective filtering algorithms employing artificial intelligence components. The solution provides a tool for analyzing density of targets in a specific area, useful when checking contact proximities of a target along a route. The principle consists of the detection of mobile devices that use active Bluetooth connections, such as personal notebooks, smartphones, smartwatches, Bluetooth headphones, etc. to locate and track their movement in the dedicated area. For this purpose, a specific configuration of three BT sensors is used and RSSI levels compared, based on a combination of differential location estimates. The solution may also be suited for indoor localization where GPS signals are usually weak or missing; for example, in public places such as subway stations or trains, hospitals, airport terminals and so on. The applicability of this solution is estimated to be vast, ranging from travel and transport information services, route guidance, passenger flows tracking, and path recovery for persons suspected to have SARS-COV2 or other contagious viruses, serving epidemiologic enquiries. The specific configuration of Bluetooth detectors may be installed either in a fixed location, or in a public transport vehicle. A set of filters and algorithms for triangulation-based location of detected targets and movement tracking, based on artificial intelligence is employed. When applied in the public transport field, this setup can be also developed to extract additional information on traffic, such as private traffic flowing, or passenger movement patterns along the vehicle route, improved location in absence of GPS signals, etc. Field tests have been carried out for determining different aspects concerning indoor location accuracy, reliability, selection of targets and filtering. Results and possible applications are also presented in the final section of the paper.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. T cells play a key role in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected cells and facilitating the selection of virus-specific antibodies. However neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T cell clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

This condition can induce oxidative stress, decrease immune system function, impair endothelial function, induce apoptosis, and reduce antioxidant in the lungs. We provide a possible mechanism in severe COVID-19 patients and recommend treatment strategy to reduce mortality rate and prevent adverse outcomes after intensive care unit (ICU).

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed a challenge to education but created an opportunity to spearhead a digital transformation and the novel delivery of a Pharm.D. curriculum. The process to transform the curriculum in a sustainable and iterative manner involved multiple steps including: (1) Communication, (2) Maintaining faculty engagement, (3) Allowing outside the box thinking, (4) Providing resources and tools and (5) Creating accountability and timelines. At our institution, we have been interested in digital transformation since completing our interview of global leaders. We began our journey using the current COVID-19 pandemic as an accelerant for change. Digital transformation in any industry is not a simple undertaking. However, with planning, aligned organizational interests, consistent and regular communication, provision of resources and tools, engaging faculty and creating accountability and timelines with deliverables the implementation can be successful. When the global pandemic wanes and educational institutions commence in-person classes, having undergone the stages of digital transformation, we will be able to embrace these changes and transform education, not having to reproduce pre-pandemic educational systems.

It draws on first-person experience of what it is to go through and survive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. It summarizes the research on the short- and long-term outcomes for critically ill patients. The physical, cognitive, and emotional sequalae are staggering. Health-care professionals and systems will have to step up to meet the challenge of caring for large numbers of COVID-19 patients after discharge. And societies will have to step up to the ethical questions that the pandemic has made so stark. What kind of societies do we want to be, in terms of guarding the welfare of our most vulnerable citizens?

AB  - The global pandemic crisis, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has claimed the lives of millions of people across the world. Development and testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs or vaccines have not turned to be realistic within the timeframe needed to combat this pandemic. Here, we report a comprehensive computational approach to identify the multi-targeted drug molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whichare crucially involved in the viral-host interaction, replication of the virus inside the host, disease progression and transmission of coronavirus infection. Virtual screening of 75 FDA-approved potential antiviral drugs against the target proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), cathepsin L (CTSL), nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), resulted in the selection of seven drugs which preferentially bind to the target proteins. Further, the molecular interactions determined by molecular dynamics simulation revealed that among the 75 drug molecules, catechin can effectively bind to 3CLpro, CTSL, RBD of S protein, NSP6 and nucleocapsid protein. It is more conveniently involved in key molecular interactions, showing binding free energy (ΔGbind) in the range of -5.09 kcal/mol (CTSL) to -26.09 kcal/mol (NSP6). At the binding pocket, catechin is majorly stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions, displays ΔEvdW values: -7.59 to -37.39 kcal/mol. Thus, the structural insights of better binding affinity and favorable molecular interaction of catechin toward multiple target proteins signify that catechin can be potentially explored as a multi-targeted agent against COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has been efficient in ensuring that many countries are brought to a standstill. With repercussions ranging from rampant mortality, fear, paranoia, and economic recession, the virus has brought together countries to look at possible therapeutic countermeasures. With prophylactic interventions possibly months away from being particularly effective, a slew of measures and possibilities concerning the design of vaccines are being worked upon. We attempted a structure-based approach utilizing a combination of epitope prediction servers and Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to develop a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine that involves the two subunits of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (S1 and S2) coupled with a substantially effective chimeric adjuvant to create stable vaccine constructs. The designed constructs were evaluated based on their docking with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 4. Our findings provide an epitope-based peptide fragment that can be a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Recent experimental studies based on determining immunodominant regions across the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of the predicted epitopes included in this study.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, elderly individuals (with the chronological age of 65 years and above) are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection complications due to altered immune system response and the higher rate of underlying comorbidities. A vast majority of mortalities are reported in elderly patients; thus, this study aimed to evaluate complications of COVID-19 in elderly patients. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to MOOSE guidelines. Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed databases were searched for published articles related to COVID-19 in the elderly up to March 26, 2020. Search MeSh terms included "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "2019-nCoV", "SARS-CoV-2", "comorbidity", "elderly", and "geriatrics". Results: In total 1360 potentially relevant articles were screened, of which 35 were relevant and their full texts were considered for the review. Organ damages to the pulmonary system, cardiovascular, liver, and renal system are more prevalent in the elderly with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the chance of multiorgan involvement is more common among elderly patients, preventive, multidisciplinary, and holistic evaluations are essential to reduce disease consequences. Conclusion: More attention needs to be paid to elderly individuals in the quarantine. Social contact should be made and maintained through online facilities, media, and phone calls to ensure patients' mental health during this stressful situation. Also, they should be provided with enough food and medications by their families or friends. Also, providing social and volunteer services might play an important role in the mental health of those patients who have no social network.

AB  - The disease (COVID-19) novel coronavirus pandemic has so far infected millions resulting in the death of over a million people as of Oct 2020. More than 90% of those infected with COVID-19 show mild or no symptoms but the rest of the infected cases show severe symptoms resulting in significant mortality. Age has emerged as a major factor to predict the severity of the disease and mortality rates are significantly higher in elderly patients. Besides, patients with underlying conditions like Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cancer have an increased risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 infection. Obesity has emerged as a novel risk factor for hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. Several independent studies have observed that people with obesity are at a greater risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19. Here we review the published data related to obesity and overweight to assess the possible risk and outcome in Covid-19 patients based on their body weight. Besides, we explore how the obese host provides a unique microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, resulting in increased severity of the disease and poor outcome.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought challenges to clinicians caring for patients with chronic liver disease. In the past 6 months, COVID-19 has led to over 150,000 deaths in the United States and over 660,000 deaths around the world. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic liver diseases can have an adverse effect on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. We present a comprehensive review of the latest literature on preexisting liver diseases and its interrelationship with COVID-19 infection in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and viral hepatitis B. As social distancing and telemedicine gain new footing, we synthesize recommendations from 3 major hepatology societies [American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), the European Association for the Study of Liver (EASL), and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of Liver (APASL)] to present the best approaches for caring for patients with liver diseases as well as those requiring liver transplantation.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 alongside the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 underscore the significance to understand betacoronaviruses as a global health challenge. SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent for COVID-19, has infected over 50 million individuals' worldwide with more than ∼1 million fatalities. Autophagy modulators have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2 but recent clinical setbacks urge for better understanding of viral subversion of autophagy. Using MHV-A59 as a model betacoronavirus, time-course infections revealed significant loss in the protein level of ULK1, a canonical autophagy-regulating kinase, and the concomitant appearance of a possible cleavage fragment. To investigate whether virus-encoded proteases target ULK1, we conducted in-vitro and cellular cleavage assays and identified ULK1 as a novel bona fide substrate of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Mutagenesis studies discovered that ULK1 is cleaved at a conserved PLpro recognition sequence (LGGG) after G499, separating its N-terminal kinase domain from a C-terminal substrate recognition region. Over-expression of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is sufficient to impair starvation-induced autophagy and disrupt formation of ULK1-ATG13 complex. Finally, we demonstrated a dual role for ULK1 in MHV-A59 replication, serving a pro-viral functions during early replication that is inactivated at late stages of infection. In conclusion, our study identified a new mechanism by which PLpro of betacoronaviruses induces viral pathogenesis by targeting cellular autophagy.

AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway links the cell-surface receptors to the transcription machinery, transducing the extracellular signals into several outputs, which may also adapt the host defense mechanism to viral attacks. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected upwards of nearly 70 million people and worldwide has claimed more than 1,600,000 deaths. So far, there continues to be no specific treatment for this novel coronavirus-induced disease. In the search to control the global COVID-19 pandemic, some eastern and developing countries have approved a variety of treatments with controversial efficacy, among which is the use of the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Interestingly, prior data had indicated that the HCQ/CQ could influence the MAPK cascade. The main aim of this review is to address molecular mechanisms, beyond drugs, that can be helpful against viral infection for this and future pandemics. We will highlight (1) the contribution of the MAPK cascade in viral infection and (2) the possible use of MAPK inhibitors in curbing viral infections, alone or in combination with HCQ and quinoline analogues. We are convinced that understanding the molecular patterns of viral infections will be critical for new therapeutical approaches to control this and other severe diseases.

AB  - Azithromycin is a macrolide-type antibiotic used against a broad range of bacterial infection, such as respiratory tract, skin, ear, eye infections, and sexually transmitted diseases. The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) mediated by Corona Virus 2 (CoVid19) is a global health concern and various countries witnessed the loss of precious human life. In fall 2020, the absence of specific suitable medication or vaccine is still a major cause of concern to fight the pandemic while different countries have already started using their own medication and available resources to save the life of their citizens. At the present, in many countries around the world, we witnessed the use of the antibiotic azithromycin towards the medication of CoVid19; even its effect on anti CoVid19 is still controversial. This mini review aims to address whether azithromycin can affect molecular pathway involved in inflammatory immunity upon viral infection, to find out the rationale behind the use of azithromycin in the treatment of CoVid19. Overall, the data show that the mechanism of action of azithromycin in viral infection may be dependent on a global amplification of the interferon-dependent pathways mediating antiviral responses, leading to a reduction of viral replication, together with a strong impairment of the inflammatory pathways, relying on MAPK cascade inactivation.

AB  - In this study, we examined five previously synthesized compounds and checked their binding affinity towards the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) by molecular docking study, and compared the data with three FDA approved drugs, i.e., Remdesivir, Ivermectine and Hydroxychlorochine. In addition, we have investigated the docking study against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) by using Autodock 4.2 software package. The results suggested that the investigated compounds have property to bind the active position of the protein as reported in approved drugs. Hence, further experimental studies are required. The formation of intermolecular interactions, negative values of scoring functions, free binding energy and the calculated binding constants confirmed that the studied compounds have significant affinity for the specified biotarget. These studied compounds were passed the drug-likeness criteria as suggested by calculating ADME data by SwissADME server. Moreover, the ADMET properties suggested that the investigated compounds to be orally active compounds in human. Furthermore, density functional computations (DFT) were executed by applying GAUSSIAN 09 suit program. In addition, Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) was studied by applying HyperChem Professional 8.0.3 program.

AB  - To understand air transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and risks for health care personnel and visitors to hospitals, we analyzed air samples collected from various enclosures in hospitals at Hyderabad and Mohali and performed closed room experiments with COVID-19 positive individuals. We collected 64 air samples from COVID and non-COVID areas of various hospitals and 17 samples from closed rooms occupied by COVID patients. 4 samples from COVID care areas were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no obvious predilection towards ICU/non-ICU areas in the hospital samples. In the closed room experiments, where one or more COVID-19 patients spent a short duration of time, one sample - collected immediately after the departure of three symptomatic patients from the room - was positive. Our results indicate that the chance of picking up SARS-CoV-2 in the air is directly related to a number of COVID positive cases in the room, their symptomatic status, and the duration of exposure and that the demarcation of hospital areas into COVID and non-COVID areas is a successful strategy to prevent cross infections. In neutral environmental conditions, the virus does not seem to spread farther away from the patients, especially if they are asymptomatic, giving an objective evidence for the effectiveness of physical distancing in curbing the spread of the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, IndiaAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of CSIR- Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (IEC-83/2020)"All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The incidence of heart failure (HF) remains high and patients with HF are at risk for frequent hospitalisations. Remote monitoring technologies may provide early indications of HF decompensation and potentially allow for optimisation of therapy to prevent HF hospitalisations. The need for reliable remote monitoring technology has never been greater as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid expansion of a new mode of healthcare delivery: the virtual visit. With the convergence of remote monitoring technologies and reliable method of remote healthcare delivery, an understanding of the role of both in the management of patients with HF is critical. In this review, we outline the evidence on current remote monitoring technologies in patients with HF and highlight how these advances may benefit patients in the context of the current pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 raised concern for those spending time in college classrooms and dormitories. Students faced sudden changes to their lives and relied upon written messages for directives. This study investigated the language of university-based communications, based on models of crisis communication and epidemic management. METHODS: The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was used to investigate the language in the most salient written messages from universities to students regarding the migration to online classes. RESULTS: As predicted, certain word types were used more frequently than others. The larger the student body, the more frequently universities used positive emotion/resilience and power/organizational words. and the more likely a COVID update would be posted on the homepage within three months' time. CONCLUSION: Messages should be guided by models of crisis management and carefully crafted, given the role of universities in managing large numbers of students during ongoing pandemic illness.

AB  - Background: The contact restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have led many companies to allow their employees to work from home for infection control reasons. Objective: This literature review explores the question in what way health-promoting work from home can be excercised. Results: Working from home requires consideration of the same guidelines just like those for office and computer workstations. To prevent negative mental and physical stress reactions, an ergonomic workstation design is recommended. Furthermore, the organization of working time (structuring the working day, adhering to breaks and regeneration units, and avoiding disturbances and interruptions) is of great importance for a health-promoting work design at home. Conclusion: Important components of a health-promoting work design are temporal, spatial and mental separation of work and private life. Employees and their individual needs must be taken into account when designing a health-promoting workplace at home; however, the responsibility for implementing health-promoting work design mostly lies solely with the employees due to the ad hoc change of workplace.

AB  - The worldwide outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as a novel human coronavirus, was the worrying news at the beginning of 2020. Since its emergence complicated more than 870,000 individuals and led to more than 43,000 deaths worldwide. Considering to the potential threat of a pandemic and transmission severity of it, there is an urgent need to evaluate and realize this new virus's structure and behavior and the immunopathology of this disease to find potential therapeutic protocols and to design and develop effective vaccines. This disease is able to agitate the response of the immune system in the infected patients, so ARDS, as a common consequence of immunopathological events for infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, could be the main reason for death. Here, we summarized the immune response and immune evasion characteristics in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic and prophylactic strategies with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges.

Exchange between bioethicists, social scientists, and life scientists should emphasize the biological effects-made evident through health disparities-of racism. I discuss this through examples of patient-provider communication in fertility clinics in South Africa and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to emphasize the issue of mistrust between patients and medical institutions. Health disparities and medical mistrust are interrelated problems of racism in healthcare provision.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, in some jurisdictions, police have become involved in enforcing coronavirus-related measures. Relatedly, several North American jurisdictions have established COVID-19 data sharing protocols with law enforcement. Research across a range of fields has demonstrated that involving police in matters of public health disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable and does more harm than good. This is reflected in the consensus against COVID-19 criminalization that has emerged among civil society organizations focused on HIV, human rights, and harm reduction. The European Data Protection Board has also released guidelines against re-uses of COVID-19 data for law enforcement purposes. This article offers an overview of the harms of criminalizing illnesses and strategies for health stakeholders to seek alternatives to sharing COVID-19 data with police agencies while facilitating interoperability with healthcare first responders. It also presents case studies from two North American jurisdictions - Ontario and Minnesota - that have established routine COVID-19 data sharing with police. We recommended seven alternatives, including designating COVID-19 data as sensitive and implementing segmented interoperability with first responder agencies. These guidelines can help ensure that health information technology platforms do not become vehicles for the criminalization of COVID-19, and that health data stay within the health system.

AB  - Maltreatment of children continues to be a major public health concern, with high social, economic and health burdens. Rates vary by a number of factors that can be categorized into different levels of the social ecology. Research and theory in this field point to the importance of community-level factors that can contribute to either risk or prevention of child maltreatment. The COVID-19 pandemic context creates additional risks and concerns related to child maltreatment and exacerbates risk factors that existed before: e.g., families and communities are in much worsened states of poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity; losses and grief are affecting mental health; and limitations and safety concerns are affecting in-person child protection work and more. Central to recovery from this pandemic will be the mobilization of community-level resources and the building back up of the social fabric that can support vulnerable children and caregivers. Key to this mobilization will be a better intersectional understanding of structural inequities in the child welfare system and in our communities. Efforts to dismantle structural biases and discrimination are critical to provide safety and support for families and vital for effective child maltreatment prevention. In this context, we discuss the state of the science of community-level prevention of childhood maltreatment, highlighting evidence-based community-level prevention programs and how these types of efforts may be impacted by the current COVID-19 global pandemic.

AB  - With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showing no signs of abating, resuming neglected tropical disease (NTD) activities, particularly mass drug administration (MDA), is vital. Failure to resume activities will not only enhance the risk of NTD transmission, but will fail to leverage behaviour change messaging on the importance of hand and face washing and improved sanitation-a common strategy for several NTDs that also reduces the risk of COVID-19 spread. This so-called "hybrid approach" will demonstrate best practices for mitigating the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by incorporating physical distancing, use of masks, and frequent hand-washing in the delivery of medicines to endemic communities and support action against the transmission of the virus through water, sanitation and hygiene interventions promoted by NTD programmes. Unless MDA and morbidity management activities resume, achievement of NTD targets as projected in the WHO/NTD Roadmap (2021-2030) will be deferred, the aspirational goal of NTD programmes to enhance universal health coverage jeopardised and the call to 'leave no one behind' a hollow one. We outline what implementing this hybrid approach, which aims to strengthen health systems, and facilitate integration and cross-sector collaboration, can achieve based on work undertaken in several African countries.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus outbreak has caused substantial changes in societal norms as well as adjustments in health systems worldwide. To date the impact of these pandemic-related variations has yet to be fully understood also in the field of maternal health for which continuity of care is a proven life-saving preventive measure. DESIGN: Following the PRISMA guidelines for reviews, a literature search was carried out to assess different approaches that combine quality of maternal care with the imposed social-distancing rules. Nine studies were included in the scoping review. FINDINGS: Reduction of in-person visits is the preferred overall solution. Yet, fewer consultations can still guarantee essential services and appropriate care through integration with telemedicine. Referral to epidemic-free community centres is an alternative option and new paths need to include the interdisciplinary contribution of medical consultants and IT experts, among others. In this context, delaying access for symptomatic expectant mothers is still debated since it carries the potential risk of untimely detection of pregnancy complications. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary experiences provide an overview of the different attempts put in place to reshape health services to contain the pandemic hazards. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These early prototypes may inspire future innovative health solutions compatible with local resources and specific population preferences and needs.

AB  - The UK's response to COVID-19 has been widely criticized by scientists and the public. According to EuroMOMO, a European mortality monitoring initiative, the excess mortality that may be attributable to COVID-19 in England is one of the highest in Europe, second only to Spain. While critiqued from a public health perspective, much less attention is given to the implications of the pandemic outbreak for the right to health as defined under international human rights law and ratified by member states. Using the UK as a case study, we examine critically the extent to which the government's response to COVID-19 complied with the legal framework of the right to health. We review further key states' obligations on the right to health and assess its suitability in times of pandemic. Finally, we offer some recommendations for an update of the right to health. This paper adds to the body of literature on the right to health and human rights based-approaches to health.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global pandemic, and resulted in high case-fatality rate in the elderly. In addition to typical respiratory responses, ~50% of clinical cases include gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and persistent fecal shedding of the virus even after its clearance from the pulmonary system. In the present study, we assessed aging-associated gut transcriptomic responses considering the gastrointestinal symptoms contributing to COVID-19 severity. Intestinal expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and defense biomarkers decreased with increasing age. Moreover, aging-associated integrated stress responses (ISR) and mTOR-linked cell metabolic stress signals counteracted gut defense biomarkers. However, SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression was positively associated with gut barrier integrity potently via downregulation of the two stress-responsive signals. Gut transcriptome-based mechanistic prediction implicates that high susceptibility to COVID-19 in the elderly with low SARS-CoV-2 receptors is due to aging stress-associated defective gut defense, providing a new avenue for viral entry receptor-independent interventions.

AB  - Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is the cause of acute outbreaks of vomiting and wasting disease and/or encephalomyelitis in neonatal pigs, with naive herds particularly vulnerable to clinical episodes. PHEV infections in older pigs are generally considered to be subclinical, but are poorly characterized in the refereed literature. In this study, twelve 7-week-old pigs were oronasally inoculated with 0.5 mL (1:128 HA titer) PHEV (Mengeling strain) and then followed through 42 days post inoculation (dpi). Fecal and oral fluid specimens were collected daily to evaluate viral shedding. Serum samples were tested for viremia, isotype-specific antibody responses, cytokine, and chemokine responses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated to evaluate phenotype changes in immune cell subpopulations. No clinical signs were observed in PHEV inoculated pigs, but virus was detected in oral fluid (1-28 dpi) and feces (1-10 dpi). No viremia was detected, but a significant IFN-α response was observed in serum at 3 dpi, followed by the detection of IgM (dpi 7), and IgA/IgG (dpi 10). Flow cytometry revealed a one-off increase in cytotoxic T cells at 21 dpi. This study demonstrated that exposure of grower pigs to PHEV results in subclinical infection characterized by active viral replication and shedding followed by an active humoral and cell-mediated immune response that attenuates the course of the infection and results in viral clearance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, rehabilitation facilities have become less accessible for patients with a stroke. Lack of early, intensive rehabilitation misses the opportunity for recovery during the critical time window of endogenous plasticity and improvement post-stroke. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary was to highlighting the benefits of telework and telerehabilitation programs for workers with a stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Relevant publications regarding the management of individuals with a stroke, telerehabilitation and teleworking in the setting of COVID-19 were reviewed. RESULTS: Previous studies showed that telerehabilitation can effectively provide an alternate method of promoting recovery for patients with a stroke. With the physical distancing precautions in place for mitigating viral spread, teleworking can also provide a method for long term recovery and improvements in quality of life after a stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this commentary addresses the benefits of physically distant, safe and effective alternatives to support individuals who live with a stroke during COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), turned out to be a global pandemic with unstoppable morbidity and mortality rate. However, till date there is no effective treatment found against SARS-CoV-2. We report on the major in-depth molecular and docking analysis by using antiretroviral (Lopinavir and ritonavir), antimalarial (Hydroxychloroquine), antibiotics (Azithromycin), and dietary supplements (Vitamin C and E) to provide new insight into drug repurposing molecular events involved in SARS-CoV-2. We constructed three drug-target-pathways-disease networks to predict the targets and drugs interactions as well as important pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2. The results suggested that by using the combination of Lopinavir, Ritonavir along with Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin C may turned out to be the effective line of treatment for SARS-CoV-2 as it shows the involvement of PARP-1, MAPK-8, EGFR, PRKCB, PTGS-2, and BCL-2. Gene ontology biological process analysis further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (P < 0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus, C-C chemokine receptor activity, and platelet activation. KEGG pathway analysis involves multiple pathways (P < 0.05), including FoxO, GnRH, ErbB, Neurotrophin, Toll-like receptor, IL-17, TNF, Insulin, HIF-1, JAK-STAT, Estrogen, NF-kappa, Chemokine, VEGF, and Thyroid hormone signaling pathway in SARS-CoV-2. Docking study was carried out to predict the molecular mechanism Thus, the potential drug combinations could reduce viral infectivity, viral replication, and abnormal host inflammatory responses and may be useful for multi-target drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The current, global situation regarding the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and its potentially devastating clinical manifestations, i.e. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), took the world by storm, as millions of people have been infected worldwide and more than 1,600,000 patients have succumbed. Infection induced by various respiratory viruses may lead to thrombotic complications. Infection-elicited thrombosis may involve a repertoire of distinct, yet interconnected pathophysiological mechanisms, implicating a hyperinflammatory response, platelet activation and triggering of the coagulation cascade. In the present review, we present current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms that may underlie thrombotic complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we provide clinical data regarding the incidence rate of thrombotic events in several viral respiratory infections that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, including SARS-CoV-2 infection and finally we summarize current recommendations concerning thromboprophylaxis and antithrombotic therapy in patients with thrombotic complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 caused a global pandemic problem. No confident management is introduced for it yet. This study aimed to propose a dietary protocol for hospitalized patients with the diagnosis of acute respiratory infectious disease caused by COVID-19 based on Persian Medicine. Methods: This study was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, any diseases that could be matched with the clinical features of infection with COVID-19 were searched in selected PM references. In the second phase, medicinal herbs and foods that were available and could be used in the hospital diet were extracted and summarized. In the third phase, the new documentation of these pharmaceutical and food items was conducted. Results: The signs and symptoms of infectious respiratory disease caused by COVID-19 can be categorized in the field of Zato al-rieh that can mainly be matched with pneumonia. Based on the described criteria, some nutrients and medicinal materia medica have been introduced for acute respiratory infection including Cydonia oblonga, Honey, Citrus sinensis, Malus domestica, Citrus medica, Crocus sativus, Raisin, Rosa Damas Cena, D.Carota, Camellia Sinensis, Anethum graveolens dhi, Punica granatum, Petroselinum Crispum, Coriandrum sativum, Urtica dioica, Allium sativum, Sesamum indicum. Conclusion: Most materia medica has documents in current articles including anti-cough suppressants, antiviral properties, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory etc. A protocol of hospital diet for patients with infectious respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 has been introduced in this manuscript.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has emerged and rapidly spread across the world. The COVID-19 severity is associated to viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary complications. Hyperinflammation, dysfunctional immune response and hypercoagulability state are associated to poor prognosis. Therefore, the repositioning of multi-target drugs to control the hyperinflammation represents an important challenge for the scientific community. Cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase type-3 inhibitor (PDE-3), is an antiplatelet and vasodilator drug, that presents a range of pleiotropic effects, such as antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardioprotective activities. Cilostazol also can inhibit the adenosine uptake, which enhances intracellular cAMP levels. In the lungs, elevated cAMP promotes anti-fibrotic, vasodilator, antiproliferative effects, as well as mitigating inflammatory events. Interestingly, a recent study evaluated antiplatelet FDA-approved drugs through molecular docking-based virtual screening on viral target proteins. This study revealed that cilostazol is a promising drug against COVID-19 by inhibiting both main protease (Mpro) and Spike glycoprotein, reinforcing its use as a promising therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Considering the complexity associated to COVID-19 pathophysiology and observing its main mechanisms, this article raises the hypothesis that cilostazol may act on important targets in development of the disease. This review highlights the importance of drug repurposing to address such an urgent clinical demand safely, effectively and at low cost, reinforcing the main pharmacological actions, to support the hypothesis that a multi-target drug such as cilostazol could play an important role in the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - The century-old tuberculosis vaccine BCG has been the focus of renewed interest due to its well-documented ability to protect against various non-TB pathogens. Much of these broad spectrum protective effects are attributed to trained immunity, the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells. As BCG vaccine is safe, cheap, widely available, amendable to use as a recombinant vector, and immunogenic, it has immense potential for use as an immunotherapeutic agent for various conditions including autoimmune, allergic, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic diseases as well as a preventive measure against infectious agents. Of particular interest is the use of BCG vaccination to counteract the increasing prevalence of autoimmune and allergic conditions in industrialized countries attributable to reduced infectious burden as described by the 'hygiene hypothesis.' Furthermore, BCG vaccination has been proposed as a potential therapy to mitigate spread and disease burden of COVID-19 as a bridge to development of a specific vaccine and recombinant BCG expression vectors may prove useful for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 antigens (rBCG-SARS-CoV-2) to induce long-term immunity. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of BCG vaccine in these disease contexts is therefore critical. To that end, we review here BCG-induced immunomodulation focusing specifically on BCG-induced trained immunity and how it relates to the 'hygiene hypothesis' and COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing opioid epidemic, rise in substance use, and social and political unrest in the US and globally has impacted how substance use-related health needs are addressed. These issues were driving forces in planning AMERSA's 44th annual conference. True to the multidisciplinary spirit, and with diversity goals and advocacy at the forefront of mind, "together we rise" became the beacon for the AMERSA 2020 conference. This commentary provides an overview of the conference proceedings, topics that were highly relevant for clinicians, educators, researchers, and advocates for change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) and was declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 which is leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In compliance with WHO recommendation of movement restrictions, many countries have imposed compulsory self-quarantine and restricted movements of their citizenries (lockdown/sit at home) and closure of businesses and borders as preventive measures to the fast-spreading virus. Consequently, this decision has made the emergence of behaviors that are detrimental to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which are the leading cause of the global mortality rate. MAIN BODY: The increase in sedentary lifestyles, alcohol consumption, and substance abuse during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown as a result of personal restrictions in COVID-19 lockdown is linked with the risk of death from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CONCLUSION: The lockdown has increased risk factors of CVDs, and as such, there might be an increase in the number of non-communicable disease (NCD)-related mortality rate. The effect does not end during the period of coronavirus pandemic but even after the pandemic.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 infection results in various viral-related physical and mental health problems, joined with the long-term psychological impact of the pandemic in general. However, the accompanying neurocognitive changes remain poorly understood. RECENT FINDINGS: We synthetize the current knowledge of viral (SARS-CoV-2) induced inflammation, mechanisms to viral entry into the central nervous system and altered neurotransmitter systems to provide an informed neurobiological explanation for the rise of neurocognitive disorders (defined as per the DSM-5 criteria). SUMMARY: The mild and major neurocognitive disorder symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic provide a unique opportunity to address the early changes underlying neurocognitive impairment at both clinical and molecular level. We discuss the utilization of the available evidence for their management and future novel therapeutic opportunities.

AB  - While clinical characteristics exhibit that susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is equally likely between males and females, clinical outcomes show that males experience both a higher severity and fatality for COVID-19 infection than females. This review examines the evidence for these sex and gender differences and aims to illustrate possible mechanisms behind such sensitivity. Successful entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body is dependent on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, sex-based differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 may explain the disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality. Furthermore, these disparities may also be attributed to sex-based difference in immunological responses. Finally, the differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections between men and women may be due to gendered differences in behaviors, such as smoking, and prevalence to comorbidities. An understanding of the sex and gender sensitivities of COVID-19 infection is a necessary component towards the creation of effective treatment options and therapies for the virus.

AB  - The majority of children with COVID-19 infections, fortunately, shows only milder symptoms. Which however has led that they are considered only for their particular transmission potential. Nevertheless, cases with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Kawasaki Disease with quite specific COVID-19 involvement have been reported and should be taken seriously. In addition, there are many children with a chronic pre-existing condition such as congenital heart disease, cancer, or lung disease who may be at risk for a severe course of COVID-19 when infected. Protecting these children, and children in general, should be a top priority, as these patients will have to live the rest of their long lives with possible sequelae of COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease with varying clinical presentations and outcomes, and responsible for a major pandemic that started in early 2020. With no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments available, the quest for novel therapeutic solutions remains an urgent priority. Rocaglates, a class of plant-derived cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including coronaviruses. Specifically, rocaglates inhibit eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent mRNA translation initiation, resulting in strongly reduced viral RNA translation. Here, we assessed the antiviral activity of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (-) against SARS-CoV-2 using both in vitro and ex vivo cell culture models. In Vero E6 cells, CR-31-B (-) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 of ~1.8 nM. In primary human airway epithelial cells, CR-31-B (-) reduced viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 100 nM. Reduced virus reproduction was accompanied by substantially reduced viral protein accumulation and replication/transcription complex formation. The data reveal a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by CR-31-B (-), corroborating previous results obtained for other coronaviruses and supporting the idea that rocaglates may be used in first-line antiviral intervention strategies against novel and emerging RNA virus outbreaks.

AB  - Convolutional neural networks were used for multiclass segmentation in thermal infrared face analysis. The principle is based on existing image-to-image translation approaches, where each pixel in an image is assigned to a class label. We show that established networks architectures can be trained for the task of multiclass face analysis in thermal infrared. Created class annotations consisted of pixel-accurate locations of different face classes. Subsequently, the trained network can segment an acquired unknown infrared face image into the defined classes. Furthermore, face classification in live image acquisition is shown, in order to be able to display the relative temperature in real-time from the learned areas. This allows a pixel-accurate temperature face analysis e.g. for infection detection like Covid-19. At the same time our approach offers the advantage of concentrating on the relevant areas of the face. Areas of the face irrelevant for the relative temperature calculation or accessories such as glasses, masks and jewelry are not considered. A custom database was created to train the network. The results were quantitatively evaluated with the intersection over union (IoU) metric. The methodology shown can be transferred to similar problems for more quantitative thermography tasks like in materials characterization or quality control in production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic posed great challenges for teachers and students, as teaching had to take place despite the restriction of classroom teaching. For attendance lessons and events with patient contact alternatives had to be arranged at short notice between mid-March and the beginning of the semester in mid-April. OBJECTIVE: Description of the concept and implementation in the student teaching at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center Mainz in complete digital form in spring 2020. PRESENTATION OF CONCEPT: Lectures, examination course and practical training in ophthalmology take place in the 5th and 6th semester of the study of human medicine. The basis of the new concept were the former course curricula. Implemented concepts included a complete revision and implementation of lectures as video podcasts, examination videos, online examination conferences, interactive patient cases, narrated videos of surgery, anamnesis videos of patients and the design of the virtual patient room, a live online practice with presentation and examination of patients including transmission of the slit-lamp image to reproduce anterior and posterior segment examination. An evaluation showed a very positive reception of the new concept by students. DISCUSSION: Within a tight timeframe of 4 weeks a complete revision of the ophthalmology course was achieved. The implementation was time-consuming, with the largest share in the media production of examination videos, interactive patient cases and video podcasts of the lectures. We consider a reduction of classroom teaching for parts of the learning objectives that can be represented by such videos to be possibly useful. An independent digital appropriation of such content may enable a more productive learning environment in face-to-face teaching.

AB  - Being diagnosed as positive for SARS-2 CoV RNA on PCR generates anxiety and stress as well as depression due to the prospects of being isolated. With genetically varied forms of virus on the rise the widely adopted manner to protect oneself is social distancing. This is frightening for rehabilitation professionals who at times are exposed at close quarters to the patients as rehabilitation is essential. Data in this backdrop is lacking, as this is a recent and ongoing pandemic. As such the current study was conducted with an attempt to review and highlight the causes of fright among rehabilitation professionals and possible management options in the wake of current pandemic of COVID-19 in the perspective of Pakistan. For this purpose literature was searched from major electronic databases including PubMed, Google, Google Scholar and Web-of-science, with keywords "Covid-19, mental health, telehealth, telemedicine, tele-rehabilitation and combination of words". Eighty English, full text articles were studied out of which 36 were used for the literature review. With this literature review we conclude that COVID-19 has resulted in fear of contracting and transmitting this disease among health professionals and can be reduced and managed by provision of tele-rehabilitation and telehealth facilities. Patients emerging from prolonged mechanical ventilations require extensive rehabilitation to restore routine body functions. The role of the otolaryngologist and speech language pathologist (SLP) is formal and direct to ensure appropriate and timely long term intervention and rehabilitation to ensure that these individuals re-enter mainstream activities.

AB  - COVID-19 is a menace for Pakistan's fragile and overburdened health care system and infrastructure, insidiously permeating the socio-economic fabric. Globally complete to partial shutdown of educational institutions has been enforced, transitioning from face to face to online academics. Academic institutes are floundering to withstand the brunt. Therefore, the current study was conducted to attempt to review and highlight the impact and challenges posed by transition from conventional to online academics and how to approach them, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic with the perspective of developing countries like Pakistan. For this purpose, search for relevant literature using search engines and websites including Google, Google Scholar and Web of Science as well as Medline database was conducted with keywords "Covid-19, academics, mental health, social impact and e-learning and combination of words". Thirty two English language, full text articles published in the last ten years from 2010 to 2020 were selected for the literature review. With this literature review, we conclude that this lockdown has caused significant distortion in the academic world yet unequal interruption in learning with significant disruptions in internal assessments and qualification examinations with developing countries like Pakistan, compounded by a compromised educational system. However, COVID-19 is spurring the case for conversion to online academics and developing countries like Pakistan are poised to develop reliable, cost effective and secure online academic system whether it is bane or boon.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nasal airway obstruction affects up to one-third of Americans and is one of the most common complaints by patients to otolaryngologists. Nasal airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are closely related. The aim of this study was to use the 3D imaging software, ITK-SNAP as a platform to define a gold standard for anatomically accurate boundaries of the nasal airway in 3D CBCT and to create a more reliable and precise 3D CBCT segmentation of the nasal airway for assisting diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of nasal airway obstruction and OSAS. METHOD AND MATERIALS: After review of the literature to identify established parameters using CBCT and CT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway, and the existing drawbacks, a gold standard for locating the anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway using CBCT is proposed. This new method aims at standardization of segmentation and quantification, allowing for more reliable comparison between studies. ITK-SNAP software was used to segment three CBCT samples of healthy patients aged 21 to 59 years, who were patients of record, with CBCT obtained for either orthodontic, endodontic, or prosthodontic treatment planning purposes. <br />Results: The literature search identified 11 studies describing nasal airway parameters utilizing CBCT and CT. A great variation was detected on where the anatomical boundaries for the nasal airway were selected. A new standard in the identification of anatomical boundaries of the nasal airway is proposed for consistent segmentation and quantification using 3D CBCT by using the following landmarks: the inferior ANS-PNS border, the anterior nares border, the posterior sella-PNS border, and superiorly the border in alignment with the base of the skull (excluding the ostia, frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal air cells). The three segmented samples were volumetrically measured, and statistically analyzed. The mean average Hounsfield unit intensity using the CBCT samples in this study was 629 with a standard deviation of 190. <br />Conclusion: The literature indicates a lack of a gold standard using CBCT technology for the segmentation of the nasal airway. With the proposed standard in this study, it is possible to quantify the nasal airway volume and thereby its reduction. For the general dental practitioner, this is an important aspect during the evaluation of overall airway assessment. This information can be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of airway compromised dental patients. (Quintessence Int 2021;52:154-164; doi: 10.3290/j.qi.a45429).

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has caused a world-wide pandemic with devastating effects. Fortunately, most children display only mild-to-moderate symptoms, but there are a subset that will have severe symptoms warranting treatment. This review evaluates the current evidence for antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of acute SARS-COV-2 infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 in pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment recommendations continue to evolve with emerging results from clinical trials. Initial therapies were tailored to repurposed medications, and have now transitioned toward more specific antiviral therapy. In addition to specific antiviral therapy, there is also support to modulate the immune system and reduce inflammatory damage seen in coronavirus disease 2019. Much of the data result from adult studies with subsequent extrapolation to pediatrics. SUMMARY: Recommended therapy will continue to adapt as results return from clinical trials. A continued commitment from the National Institutes of Health and research community to assist in determining optimal therapies for pediatric patients is essential. Until then, most recommendations will likely be informed from the results seen in adult populations.

AB  - AIM: To determine whether the IntelliVue monitor (ECG plus Masimo pulse oximeter (PO)) displays heart rate (HR) at birth more quickly than Nellcor PO (PO alone) among infants of 29-35 weeks' gestational age. METHODS: Unmasked parallel group randomised (1:1) study. RESULTS: We planned to enrol 100 infants; however, the study was terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic when 39 infants had been enrolled (17 randomised to IntelliVue, 22 to Nellcor). We found no differences between the groups in the time to first HR display (median (IQR) IntelliVue ECG 49 (33, 71) vs Nellcor 47 (37, 86) s, p>0.999), in the proportion who had a face mask applied for breathing support, or in the time at which it was applied. Infants monitored with IntelliVue were handled more frequently and for longer. CONCLUSION: IntelliVue ECG did not display HR more quickly than Nellcor PO in preterm infants. We found no differences in the rate of or time to intervention between groups. Our study was terminated early so these findings should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Clubhouses have been found to improve a variety of psychosocial outcomes for individuals with mental health concerns. Due to the barriers encountered during COVID-19, Clubhouses adapted their programming to meet member's needs. The purpose of the present study was to document and synthesize Clubhouse member's needs and Clubhouse adaptations during COVID-19. Clubhouse members, staff, and directors (n = 29) from five accredited Clubhouses across Canada participated in interviews about their experiences within Clubhouses during the pandemic. Interview notes were analyzed using thematic analysis through an iterative process until consensus occurred. The results indicated a number of challenges that Clubhouse members experienced including increased mental health symptoms, isolation and loneliness, and difficulty accessing services. Clubhouse adaptations included increased communication, expansion of the meal program, and sustained program delivery through technology. The results suggest that COVID-19 has provided an opportunity for Clubhouses and other community-based organizations to innovate to meet their member's needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To predict the impact of face personal protective equipment on verbal communication during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DESIGN: We assessed the effect of common types and combinations of face personal protective equipment on speech intelligibility in quiet and in a simulated noisy environment. RESULTS: Wearing face personal protective equipment impairs transmission of middle-to-high voice frequencies and affects speech intelligibility. Surgical masks are responsible for up to 23.3% loss of speech intelligibility in noisy environments. The effects are larger in the condition of advanced face personal protective equipment, accounting for up to 69.0% reduction of speech intelligibility. CONCLUSION: The use of face personal protective equipment causes significant verbal communication issues. Healthcare workers, school-aged children, and people affected by voice and hearing disorders may represent specific at-risk groups for impaired speech intelligibility.

AB  - Coronavirus entry is mediated by the spike protein which binds the receptor and mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant in vivo. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells, and more frequently formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.

AB  - Given the vast amounts of COVID-19-related messages flooding mediated and interpersonal communication channels during the global pandemic, celebrity COVID-19 disclosures offer rare opportunities to cut through message fatigue and apathy and garner the attention of wide swaths of the public. We conducted a convergent mixed method analysis of audience responses to actor Tom Hanks' March 11, 2020 disclosure of his COVID-19 diagnosis via social media. We collected our data within 24 hours of his announcement, allowing us to quickly capture emotional and cognitive responses to the announcement and to assess both demographic and psychosocial differences in types of people who heard the news in this time frame and those who had not. In our study, 587 participants had heard the news of Hanks' disclosure while 95 had not. Participants who had heard responded to an open-ended prompt asking if the disclosure affected them at all. Those who had not heard were funneled into a field intervention to test how random assignment to seeing Hanks' disclosure post or not would affect audiences' COVID-19-related emotions, cognitions, and willingness to enact prevention behaviors. The results of this mixed methods study revealed differences in responses to Hanks' disclosure based on health information source trust and involvement with Hanks as well as effects of the intervention on efficacy for dealing with COVID-19. We discuss implications for health communication theory and crafting messages that can effectively build off the attentional inertia generated by celebrity illness disclosures to encourage prevention efforts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has altered our approach to inpatient echocardiography delivery. There is now a greater focus to address key clinical questions likely to make an immediate impact in management, particularly during the period of widespread infection. Handheld echocardiography (HHE) can be used as a first-line assessment tool, limiting scanning time and exposure to high viral load. This article describes a potential role for HHE during a pandemic. We propose a protocol with a reporting template for a focused core dataset necessary in delivering an acute echocardiography service in the setting of a highly contagious disease, minimising risk to the operator. We cover the scenarios typically encountered in the acute cardiology setting and how an expert trained echocardiography team can identify such pathologies using a limited imaging format and include cardiac presentations encountered in those patients acutely unwell with COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mineworkers in South Africa experience a triple burden of disease due to their distinct work experience. Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Multiple vaccine candidates for COVID-19, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have entered clinical trials. However, some evidence suggests that patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can be reinfected. For example, in China, two discharged COVID-19 patients who had recovered and fulfilled the discharge criteria for COVID-19 were retested positive to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the virus. This finding is critical and could hamper COVID-19 vaccine development. This review offers literature-based evidence of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, provides explanation for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection both from the agent and host points of view, and discusses its implication for COVID-19 vaccine development.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Using case vignettes, we highlight challenges in communication, prognostication, and medical decision-making that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic for patients with kidney disease. We include best practice recommendations to mitigate these issues and conclude with implications for interdisciplinary models of care in crisis settings. RECENT FINDINGS: Certain biomarkers, demographics, and medical comorbidities predict an increased risk for mortality among patients with COVID-19 and kidney disease, but concerns related to physical exposure and conservation of personal protective equipment have exacerbated existing barriers to empathic communication and value clarification for these patients. Variability in patient characteristics and outcomes has made prognostication nuanced and challenging. The pandemic has also highlighted the complexities of dialysis decision-making for older adults at risk for poor outcomes related to COVID-19. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for nephrologists to be competent in serious illness communication skills that include virtual and remote modalities, to be aware of prognostic tools, and to be willing to engage with interdisciplinary teams of palliative care subspecialists, intensivists, and ethicists to facilitate goal-concordant care during crisis settings.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), was identified in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has continued to spread rapidly in numerous countries, while the search for effective therapeutic options persists. Coronaviruses, including SARS‑CoV‑2, are known to suppress and evade the antiviral responses of the host organism mediated by interferon (IFN), a family of cytokines that plays an important role in antiviral defenses associated with innate immunity, and has been used therapeutically for chronic viral diseases and cancer. On the other hand, OncoTherad, a safe and effective immunotherapeutic agent in the treatment of non‑muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), increases IFN signaling and has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for COVID‑19 in a case report that described the rapid recovery of a 78‑year‑old patient with NMIBC with comorbidities. The present review discusses the possible synergistic action of OncoTherad with vitamin D, zinc and glutamine, nutrients that have been shown to facilitate immune responses mediated by IFN signaling, as well as the potential of this combination as a therapeutic option for COVID‑19.

AB  - Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and fatigue which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The main hematological laboratory findings associated with the severe form of disease are represented by lymphopenia and eosinopenia which mostly occur in the elderly population characterized by cardiovascular comorbidities and immunosenescence. Besides, increased levels of D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C reactive protein (CRP) seem to be powerful prognostic biomarkers helping to predict the onset of coagulopathy. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an aberrant inflammatory response or "cytokine storm" which contributes to the severity of illness. At immunological level, patients affected by a severe form of COVID-19 show poor clinical trajectories characterized by differential "immunotypes" for which T cell response seems to play a critical role in understanding pathogenic mechanisms of disease. Also, patients with mild to severe COVID-19 displayed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression with a parallel reduction of CD04+ lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Corticosteroids resulted the best therapy for the immune dysregulation whereas repurposing of tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist) appears to have mixed results in patients with COVID-19. Besides, anticoagulative therapy was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality and need of intubation among COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the beneficial use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma needs to be validated in large controlled clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the main hematological parameters with a prognostic value in COVID-19 and the basis of immunological reactivity during COVID-19, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials evaluating immune targets as possible therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Antibiotic therapy is the gold standard for bacterial infections treatment. However, the rapid increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections and its recent use for secondary bacterial infections in many COVID-19 patients has considerably weakened its treatment efficacy. These shortcomings motivated researchers to develop new antibacterial materials, such as nanoparticle-based antibacterial platform with the ability to increase the chances of killing MDR strains and prevent their drug resistance. Herein, we report a new black phosphorus (BP)-based non-damaging near-infrared light-responsive platform conjugated with ZnO and Au nanoparticles as a synergistic antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus aureus species. First, BP nanosheets containing Au nanoparticles were assembled in situ with the ZnO nanoparticles prepared by a low-temperature solution synthesis method. Subsequently, the antibacterial activities of the resulting Au-ZnO-BP nanocomposite against the non-resistant, methicillin-resistant, and erythromycin-resistant S. aureus species were determined, after its photothermal efficacy was assessed. The synthesized nanocomposite exhibited excellent anti-S. aureus activity and good photothermal characteristics. The non-resistant S. aureus species did not produce drug-resistant bacteria after the treatment of multiple consecutive passages under the pressure of the proposed nanoantibiotic, but rapidly developed resistance to erythromycin. This work clearly demonstrates the excellent photothermal antibacterial properties of Au-ZnO-BP nanocomposite against the MDR S. aureus species.

AB  - The world is going through the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020. However, the pandemic appears to be less severe in highly dengue endemic countries. In this connection, several studies reported that sero-diagnostic tests for dengue virus (DV) yielded considerable false-positive results for SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa in dengue endemic regions, thereby indicating towards potential cross-reactivity between these two viruses. We anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 and DV might share antigenic similarity and performed computational docking studies to test this hypothesis. Our results predicted with high confidence that human DV antibodies can indeed, bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Some of these interactions can also potentially intercept human ACE2 receptor binding to RBM. Dengue serum samples predating the COVID-19, had been found to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and this provides direct experimental validation of our predictions. Our analysis also showed that m396 and 80R antibodies (against SARS-CoV-1) did not dock with RBM of SARS-CoV-2, a fact already proven experimentally. This confirmed reliability and robustness of our approach. So, it is highly probable that immunological memory/antibodies to DV in endemic countries may reduce the severity and spread of COVID-19. It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will hinder DV infections by binding to DV particles and reduce dengue incidences in the future or, augment DV infection and severity by deploying antibody-dependent enhancement.

AB  - Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It has been shown to improve quality of life as well as extending life of patients with ESRD as compared to renal replacement therapy (5-year survival rate of 68% after transplant vs 36% dialysis) (Hart A, Smith JM, Skeans MA. OPTN/SRTR 2015 annual data report: kidney. Am J Transplant 2017;17:21-116). Traditionally, patients undergo general endotracheal tube anesthesia for this surgery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, general anesthesia drugs and airway equipment were in short supply. Additionally, airway manipulation was avoided when possible due to concern for virus spread from aerosolizing procedures (i.e. intubation/extubation). In this case report, we review a 65-year-old female with an ESRD due to hypertension and diabetes that underwent deceased donor kidney transplant under spinal anesthesia. We will further discuss the benefits of spinal anesthesia in renal transplant operations.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic is the main topic of news worldwide by its magnitude and consequences across the entire planet. From a medical point of view, several risk factors for developing severe illness have been reported in the literature, notably an immunosuppressed status. For people living with HIV, several questions have been raised concerning not only their vulnerability, but also in relation to an eventual protection conferred by antiretroviral therapy. This article will address these two pandemics by looking at the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on people living with HIV and, in parallel, exploring similarities and differences in terms of treatment, potential for recovery, prevention and their impact on clinical research. We review also future novel therapies for the treatment of HIV.

AB  - Purpose: Health care workers are susceptible to contracting infection with COVID-19 by aerosol transmission. This is a risk while examining and/or treating an un-sedated neonate in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and treatment. But screening for neonates for ROP and treating with laser, when required, should not be delayed to avoid the blindness. We describe a cost-effective method of containing aerosols generated during such a procedure in an un-sedated baby. Methods: An acrylic transparent containment box was prepared to accommodate an average-sized infant. The box had four walls and a roof. The floor was open to place the container box over the baby. The walls have two types of openings, large ones to allow passage of hands to examine the baby, small ones to enable passage of oxygen tubing when required. A simulation was created to examine the impact of aerosol spray on examining healthcare personnel. Results: The cost of the acrylic box was negligible. It could be assembled locally with available acrylic sheets and craftsmen. It was not difficult to examine the baby inside the box, and the simulation demonstrated that it protected the health personnel from the aerosol contamination. Conclusion: The described method is likely to increase healthcare personnel's confidence not to delay or deny ROP screening and laser treatment and save the babies from blindness.

AB  - The goals of this review are to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic (SE) status on the general health and cardiovascular health of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and also discuss the measures to address disparity. SE status is a strong predictor of premature morbidity and mortality within general health. A lower SE status also has implications of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and poorer CVD risk factor profiles. CVD comorbidity is associated with a higher case severity and mortality rate from COVID-19, with both CVD and COVID-19 sharing important risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected people of a lower SE status and of ethnic minority group, who in the most deprived regions are suffering double the mortality rate of the least deprived. The acute stress, economic recession and quarantine restrictions in the wake of COVID-19 are also predicted to cause a decline in mental health. This could pose substantial increase to CVD incidence, particularly with acute pathologies such as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and cardiogenic shock among lower SE status individuals and vulnerable elderly populations. Efforts to tackle SE status and CVD may aid in reducing avoidable deaths. The implementation of 'upstream' interventions and policies demonstrates promise in achieving the greatest population impact, aiming to protect and empower individuals. Specific measures may involve risk factor targeting restrictions on the availability and advertisement of tobacco, alcohol and high-fat and salt content food, and targeting SE disparity with healthy and secure workplaces.

AB  - BACKGROUND: At the end of December 2019, a novel respiratory infection, initially reported in China, known as COVID-19 initially reported in China, and later known as COVID-19, led to a global pandemic. Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS presentations in COVID-19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the CNS features between 1 January 2020 and 20 April 2020. The data of selected studies were screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using STATA statistical software. The study protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020184456). RESULTS: Of 2,353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11,687 patients after screening. Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of COVID-19 was headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%-10.82%), dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%-8.22%), and impaired consciousness (1.90%, 95%CI: 1.0%-2.79%). CONCLUSIONS: The growing number of studies has reported COVID-19, CNS presentations as remarkable manifestations that happen. Hence, understanding the CNS characteristics of COVID-19 can help us for better diagnosis and ultimately prevention of worse outcomes.

AB  - Global health threats including epidemics and climate change, know no political borders and require regional collaboration if they are to be dealt with effectively. This paper starts with a review of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, in the context of the regional health systems, demography and politics. We suggest that Israel and Palestine function as one epidemiological unit, due to extensive border crossing of inhabitants and tourists, resulting in cross-border infections and potential for outbreaks' transmission. Indeed, there is a correlation between the numbers of confirmed cases with a 2-3 weeks lag. In contrast, Jordan has the ability to seal its borders and better contain the spread of the virus. We then discuss comparative public health aspects in relation to the management of COVID-19 and long term adaptation to climate change. We suggest that lessons from the current crisis can inform regional adaptation to climate change. There is an urgent need for better health surveillance, data sharing across borders, and more resilient health systems that are prepared and equipped for emergencies. Another essential and currently missing prerequisite is close cooperation within and across countries amidst political conflict, in order to protect the public health of all inhabitants of the region.

AB  - This article explores how socio-political crises that implicate teachers and students play out in dreams about the psychical and material realities of schooling. Teacher dreaming during crisis reveals the impossibility of the dream of education - a fantasy of control, protection, and transformation of students. The author analyzes her own teacher fantasies of protecting and transforming students during crisis as they are unfurled in her dreams to be just that, fantasies. The crises of violence and remoteness, as engendered by antisemitism, school fighting, and Covid-19, expose the fissures of this fantasy through the transferential time and ties of teaching. Ultimately, the conflicts that ensue from dreaming during crisis generate possibilities of learning through crisis.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization recommends national risk communications tools targeting migrant communities to contain the spread of COVID-19. Within Europe, migrants are often left behind in healthcare due to structural barriers driven by hostile environment measures. This study aimed to assess inclusion of migrants in COVID-19 prevention measures by evaluating if governmental risk communications are available in common migrant languages across Europe. Methods: A rapid review was performed in June 2020 to understand the availability of government produced risk communications across Council of Europe member states, namely: COVID-19 health communications, migrant-specific guidelines and COVID-19 helplines. Results: 96% (45/47) of countries sampled had online government COVID-19 advice. 30% (15/47) issued information in their official language(s), whilst 64% (30/47) of countries delivered information in additional languages. 48% (23/47) translated information into at least one migrant language. However, information on testing or healthcare entitlements in common migrant languages was only found in 6% (3/47). Half (53%; 25/47) of the countries with COVID-19 helpline offered information in at least one alternative language.No government produced risk communications on disease prevention targeting people in refugee camps or informal settlements. Conclusions: There are clear gaps in the availability of translated COVID-19 risk communications across Europe, excluding migrants from the COVID-19 response. Governments must reflect on the inclusion of migrants within their COVID-19 response and seek to engage vulnerable communities. Governments should urgently partner with non-governmental organizations who already play a key role in addressing unmet health needs.

AB  - This paper examines the different socio-economic determinants of the fatalities associated with the COVID-19 pandemic globally in social determinants of health frameworks. It adapts the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) and the quantile regression techniques to effectively exploit the non-linear estimates of the data in order to derive non-biased point estimates at each quantile and make interquantile comparisons. This is particularly useful in recommending which societal variables become most significant at catastrophic levels of a pandemic like COVID-19 when existing health systems become overwhelmed. These estimators are applied to panel data for 196 countries over days of infection from the first recorded case. The COVID-19-related data is from Our World in Data, and the socio-economic variables are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The results establish that an improved adequate health infrastructure for both testing and treatment is necessary, but not sufficient. Health systems ultimately become overwhelmed and ineffective in managing cases and reducing mortality in the face of the rising pandemic. Complementary social, economic, physical and environmental factors are necessary for curbing deaths. These factors relate to improving the health stock of the population through reductions in both communicable and non-communicable comorbidities; enhancing sanitation and hygiene; and improving the nutrition of the population. Socio-economic and environmental measures are the reduction of household and ambient air pollution; reduction of exposure to alcohol and cigarettes; reduction of poverty and ensuring economic inclusion; and learning from the past to fine-tune governments' control measures in order to minimize harm to the population while effectively curbing mortality.

AB  - During Sierra Leone's 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, early reports warned of health system collapse and potential effects on other-cause mortality. These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014-January 2015 and October 2013-January 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (-8%) and staff attrition (-3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19-induced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP pre-amplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12aD156R, engineered chimeric DNA-extended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 μL of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute pre-amplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.Competing Interest StatementP.K.J. and L.T.N. are listed as inventors on the multiple patent applications related to the content of this work.Funding StatementPortions of this work was supported by funds from the University of Florida (UF), the UF Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, the United States-India Science &amp; Technology Endowment Fund (USISTEF/COVID-I/247/2020), and the Florida Breast Cancer Foundation (AGR00018466).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was performed under the UF IRB protocol IRB202000781.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - What's new in infectious diseases in 2020 ? This year has been marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a review of the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 and its management in this article. The results of the Swiss project « PIRATE » indicate non-inferiority between CRP-guided antibiotic durations or fixed 7-day durations and 14-day durations for Gram-negative bacteremia. A Mongolian study did not show any benefit of vitamin D substitution in protecting children from tuberculosis. Baloxavir, a new antiviral against the flu, has been approved by Swissmedic. Finally, new American recommendations for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin and universal screening for hepatitis C virus have been published.

AB  - The American Heart Association (AHA) and other national institutions have endorsed modifications to resuscitation guidelines given the risk of healthcare workers' (HCWs) exposure to COVID-19. Institutional implementation of the COVID-19-focused guidelines requires both proof of feasibility and education of HCW. Pediatric critical care medical directors at The University of Texas Southwestern/Children's Health System of Texas (UTSW/CHST) created a guideline for the resuscitation of COVID-19 patients. The simulation team used in situ simulation to demonstrate guideline feasibility and to create educational materials. Methods: A UTSW/CHST guideline incorporated COVID-19-focused AHA and other national organizational recommendations to fit the institutional needs. A high-fidelity in situ simulation helped test the feasibility and optimize the UTSW/CHST guideline. We developed a novel form of rapid cycle deliberate practice (RCDP), expert-driven RCDP, in which all simulation participants are experts, to debrief the simulation. Results: In situ simulation with expert-driven RCDP demonstrated guideline feasibility in the resuscitation of a COVID-19 patient while balancing the protection of HCW. Expert-driven RCDP allowed for real-time alterations to the guideline during the simulation event. Video recording and dissemination of the simulation allowed for the education of over 300 staff on the new recommendations. Conclusions: High-fidelity in situ simulation with expert-driven RCDP created a rapid consensus among expert critical care providers to develop the UTSW/CHST guideline and quickly adopt the new AHA recommendations. This debriefing method helped minimize the risk of HCW exposure by minimizing the number of required participants and time for simulation. We recommend using this distinctive, expert-driven RCDP debriefing method for expeditious testing of COVID-19-focused processes at other institutions.Video Abstract available at: [link forthcoming].

AB  - Background: Several studies have suggested the positive impact of vitamin D on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes and mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted through the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Embase, Ovid, and The Cochrane Library with no limitation in time and language, until December 16, 2020. The results were screened based on their accordance with the subject. Two independent reviewers selected the eligible studies and the outcomes of interest were extracted. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Quasi-Experimental Studies, the remaining results were appraised critically. Statistical analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.0. Results: Of the 2311 results, 1305 duplicated results were removed. After screening the titles, abstracts, and the full-text articles of the remaining records, four studies and 259 patients were enrolled, including 139 patients in vitamin D intervention groups. In three of the studies, the patients' survival and mortality rate were evaluated. The pooled analysis of these studies showed a significantly lower mortality rate among the intervention groups (10.56%) compared with the control groups (23.88%) (OR = 0.264, 95% CI = 0.099-0.708, p-value = 0.008). Two of the studies reported the clinical outcomes based on the World Health Organization's Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) score for COVID-19, where both of them showed a significant decrease in OSCI score in the vitamin D intervention groups. Additionally, One study reported a lower rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and one study reported a significant decrease in serum levels of Fibrinogen. Conclusion: Prescribing vitamin D supplementation to patients with COVID-19 infection seems to decrease the mortality rate, the severity of the disease, and serum levels of the inflammatory markers. Further studies are needed to determine the ideal type, dosage and duration of supplementation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe research protocol of this study was approved and supported by the Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Grant number: 66884).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing potentially fatal coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with a significant health and economic burden around the globe. Currently many clinical studies are undergoing but still there is no any specific approved therapy or drug established for effective treatment of COVID-19. This review aimed to analyses various clinical studies which have been registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov and http://www.chictr.org.cn were registered with natural plant-based medicines and Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for discovering effective treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Total 46 and 64 natural drug and TCM interventions were identified which mainly determined the preventive strategies and possible treatments for COVID-19 infection. We identified that most of the clinical trial undergoing on natural compound like heparin and vitamin C as therapeutic agents and immune boosters for against COVID-19. Traditional Chinese medicines and herbal medicines can be effectively used as a preventive therapy against COVID-19 and after successful clinical trials and these potential therapies can be promoted by countries around the world.

AB  - Medical image processing is one of the most important topics in the field of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Recently, deep learning methods have carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical imaging tasks. However, conventional deep learning has two major drawbacks: 1) insufficient training data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our method to a recent issue (Coronavirus Diagnose). Several studies indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. However, well-labeled training data sets cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease and the privacy policies. The proposed method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. This study is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Caltech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of labeled COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study are: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled data in distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96% classification accuracy, which is 13% higher classification accuracy than "non-transfer" algorithms, and 8% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms.

AB  - Lecture recordings are useful learning resources that can support flexible, remote and distance learning, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study explored students' experiences of engaging with recorded lectures and the extent to which such engagement contributes to enhanced learning. The research involved the deployment of a questionnaire to undergraduate and postgraduate students (n = 660) who had access to lecture recordings at a research intensive public university in New Zealand. Key findings revealed that students who accessed lecture recordings reported an enhanced learning experience. They stated that the availability of lecture recordings created an inclusive learning environment for students with learning disabilities and fostered flexible learning for those who would otherwise be unable to attend lectures either due to sickness or work commitments. Data also suggest that students utilised lecture recordings as supplementary learning resources rather than a substitute for regular lecture attendance. Our findings substantiated previous research studies and additionally demonstrated the various ways in which students engage with lecture recordings. Moreover, the use of sentiment analysis shows how multiple data can be triangulated to confirm or contest research findings. Finally, we believe this study adds to the voice that lecture recordings are vital resources that support students' learning.

AB  - The social, financial, and emotional repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic has left many organizations that support survivors of intimate partner violence questioning how to maintain core services while addressing compounding individual, organizational, and public health issues. Stay-at-home orders and other COVID-19 mitigation strategies have resulted in reduced shelter availability and increased intimate partner violence rates. Coupled with the economic impact of the pandemic, these factors have threatened financial and housing stability. To better understand these challenges and provide immediate support, The National Alliance for Safe Housing (NASH) co-hosted a peer support call to provide a virtual platform for practitioners to ask questions, discuss challenges, and share strategies for quality service provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 800 practitioners from across the United States participated in the NASH call, most of whom were advocates, program directors, and managers. NASH gathered data on practitioners' needs from a brief survey from the registration form analyzed using conventional inductive content analysis. Practitioners' primary concerns were situated within eight questions, which we categorized into four meta-categories: (1) managing residential housing programs; (2) getting survivors materials resources; (3) keeping staff safe; and (4) maintaining organizational operations. The paper concludes with community-grounded and empirically supported practice recommendations aligned with practitioners' expressed needs.

AB  - Abstract: The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was registered in the city of Sao Paulo on February 26, 2020; however, restrictive measures and social distancing were only determined in the city on March 17, 2020. A partial lockdown aimed to mitigate the advance of the virus by raising the social isolation rates, by limiting the operation of several services and the mobility of the population. Thus, this study aims to analyze the relationship between the social isolation index in the city of Sao Paulo and the emission levels of the main air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NOx, NO, NO2, SO2 and CO), as well as air temperature. We analyzed the data collected from three urban air quality monitoring stations located in the city center of Sao Paulo from March 16, 2020 to July 20, 2020. The data for 2020 were compared with those of the previous period in 2020 and the same period in the previous 5 years (2015-2019), and also to the city's official indices of social isolation. The relationships between pollutant concentrations and the social isolation index showed that the decrease in mobility influenced the reduction in air pollution. Pollutants NO2, NOx, NO and CO had the strongest negative associations (Pearson's correlation = - 0.582; 0.481; - 0.433 and - 0.367, respectively). Our results showed that the partial lockdown (from March 17, 2020, to July 20, 2020) had a positive impact on air quality, with a reduction in the emission of pollutants NO (31.75%), NO2 (20.60%), NOx (27.21%) and CO (29.95%). The greatest reductions in the emission of pollutants were observed when the social isolation index reached an average of 52.20%. Small negative fluctuations in the social isolation index broke the most significant reductions observed at the beginning of social isolation. Graphic abstract:

AB  - Air pollution is a major contributor to human morbidity and mortality, potentially exacerbated by COVID-19, and a threat to planetary health. Participatory research, with a structural violence framework, illuminates exposure inequities and refines mitigation strategies. Home to profitable oil and shipping industries, several census tracts in Richmond, CA are among the most heavily impacted by aggregate burdens statewide. Formally trained researchers from the Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH) partnered with the RYSE youth justice center to conduct youth participatory action research on air quality justice. Staff engaged five youth researchers in: (1) collaborative research using a network of passive air monitors to quantify neighborhood disparities in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), noise pollution and community risk factors; (2) training in environmental health literacy and professional development; and (3) interpretation of findings, community outreach and advocacy. Inequities in ambient NO2, but not SO2, were observed. Census tracts with higher Black populations had the highest NO2. Proximity to railroads and major roadways were associated with higher NO2. Greenspace was associated with lower NO2, suggesting investment may be conducive to improved air quality, among many additional benefits. Youth improved in measures of empowerment, and advanced community education via workshops, Photovoice, video, and "zines".

Several promising treatment options stand out as potential therapy of COVID-19, including plasma-derived drugs, monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, antimalarial, cell therapy, and corticosteroids. Dexamethasone an approved corticosteroid medication, acting as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant agent. In the current pandemic, dexamethasone is declared a "major development" in the fight against COVID-19. Steroidal dexamethasone was presented as the recent advancement that significantly reduces the mortality rate among severe COVID-19 cases. This review summarizes the preliminary opinion about the dexamethasone outbreak, therapeutic potential, risks, and strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly spread around the world, resulting in massive medical morbidity and mortality and substantial mental health consequences. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an important psychiatric disorder associated with disasters, and many published scientific articles have reported post-traumatic stress syndromes in populations studied for COVID-19 mental health outcomes. American diagnostic criteria for PTSD have evolved across editions of the manual, and the current definition excludes naturally occurring medical illness (such as viral illness) as a qualifying trauma, ruling out this viral pandemic as the basis for a diagnosis of PTSD. This article provides an in-depth nosological consideration of the diagnosis of PTSD and critically examines three essential elements (trauma, exposure, and symptomatic response) of this diagnosis, specifically applying these concepts to the mental health outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current criteria for PTSD are unsatisfying for guiding the response to mental health consequences associated with this pandemic, and suggestions are made for addressing the conceptual diagnostic problems and designing research to resolve diagnostic uncertainties empirically.

AB  - Structure-activity relationships for hydroxychloroquine compound and its derivatives resulted in a potent antiviral activity. Where hydroxychloroquine derivatives showed an apparent efficacy against coronavirus related pneumonia. For this reason, the current study is focused on the structural properties of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Optimized structures of these molecules have been reported by using DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The geometric were determined and compared with the experimental crystal structure. The intra and intermolecular interactions which exist within these compounds are analyzed by different methods namely the topological analysis AIM, ELF and the reduced gradient of the density. These approaches make it possible in particular to study the properties of hydrogen bonds. The highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels are constructed and the corresponding frontier energy gaps are determined to realize the charge transfer within the molecule. The densities of state diagrams were determined to calculate contributions to the molecular orbitals. The molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are determined to give a visual representation of charge distribution of these ligands and to provide information linked to electrophilic and nucleophilic sites localization. Finally, these derivatives were evaluated for the inhibition of COVID-19 activity by using the molecular docking method.

AB  - During a disease outbreak, estimation of case fatality rate (CFR) is used as an indication of its severity, and a guide to plan public health strategies. Several factors affect the CFR of COVID-19 leading to false disparities between nations, especially resource poor and fragile nations. Therefore, CFRs of resource poor and fragile nations should be carefully interpreted considering all associated parameters, to serve as a guide in planning public health strategies, and channeling the limited resources and donations appropriately, taking into consideration other equally important healthcare needs in crippled healthcare systems.

Methodology: A virtual screening of molecules from the Natural Product Atlas was performed, followed by molecular dynamics simulations of the most potent inhibitor bound to two conformations of the protease and into two binding sites. Conclusion: Eight molecules with appropriate ADMET properties are suggested as potential inhibitors. The greatest benefit of this study is the demonstration that these ligands can bind in the catalytic site but also to the groove between domains II and III, where they interact with a series of residues which have an important role in the dimerization and the maturation process of the enzyme.

AB  - The diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is emerging as a hallmark of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. While the initial target of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a complex interaction between the virus and the immune system ranging from mild to controlling responses to exuberant and dysfunctional multi-tissue directed autoimmune responses. The immune system plays a dual role in COVID-19, being implicated in both the anti-viral response and in the acute progression of the disease, with a dysregulated response represented by the marked cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation, and systemic hyperinflammation. It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the COVID-19-related autoimmune/rheumatic disorders reported between January and September 2020. In particular, we investigated the cases of incident hematological autoimmune manifestations, connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome/antibodies, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like syndromes, acute arthritis, autoimmune-like skin lesions, and neurologic autoimmune conditions such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. We screened 6263 articles and report herein the findings of 382 select reports which allow us to conclude that there are 2 faces of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, that include a benign virus controlling immune response and a many faceted range of dysregulated multi-tissue and organ directed autoimmune responses that provides a major challenge in the management of this viral disease. The number of cases for each disease varied significantly while there were no reported cases of adult onset Still disease, systemic sclerosis, or inflammatory myositis.

AB  - Background The control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic depends on the profound investigation of the virus biology and its consequences. We aimed to analyze the COVID-19 research productivity of authors representing different countries and associations between the number of articles and COVID-19 spread. Methods We retrieved all articles on COVID-19 indexed in PubMed between 31 December 2019 and 30 June 2020. We identified the countries of individual authors' affiliations. We performed the R Spearman rank correlation test between the number of articles with at least one author from a country per one million citizens and Human Development Index (HDI), a number of COVID-19 cases and deaths per one million citizens before 1 July 2020. Results Overall, we identified 27,815 articles, including 18,225 original contributions, 2,449 reviews, and 69 meta-analyses on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The highest productivity characterized the authors coming from China (n = 11,519 articles with at least one author), followed by the United States of America (n = 9,666) and Italy (n = 7,261). The number of articles on COVID-19 associated with HDI (Rs = 0.79), the numbers of cases (Rs = 0.47), and deaths (Rs = 0.46) (all p < 0.001). Conclusions Early COVID-19 researches were most often authored by researchers from highly developed countries and those affected by the rapid initial spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The COVID-19 illness can occur as an occupational disease or work-related accident. According to the German list of occupational diseases, recognition as an occupational disease 3101 requires occupational exposure of an insured person who has been exposed to an increased risk of infection compared to the general population as a result of their occupational activity in one of the four areas: (1) health service or (2) social welfare sector, (3) laboratory or (4) during activities with increased risk of infection comparable to (1) to (3). The insurance cover covers employees, self-employed people - if not exempted from insurance cover - and honorary workers. The COVID-19 disease is subject to legal notification, mostly in conjunction with a contemporary SARS-CoV-2 virus detection. Regarding insured people who are not included within the aforementioned areas (1) to (4), the COVID-19 illness can be acknowledged as an occupational accident if the intense and direct contact with infected people - not intended as in the case of occupational disease 3101 - but otherwise situationally results from the insured activity itself.

AB  - Ensuring proper dosage of treatment and repetition over time is a major challenge in neurorehabilitation. However, a requirement of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement. While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals) or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high potential for individualization to patient's or pathology's specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively monitor the patient's performance, and signal processing may contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects, mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice, and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care, where hospital-based procedures are complementarily integrated with telerehabilitative ones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an enormous dislocation of society especially in South Africa. The South African government has imposed a number of measures aimed at controlling the pandemic, chief being a nationwide lockdown. This has resulted in income loss for individuals and firms, with vulnerable populations (low earners, those in informal and precarious employment, etc.) more likely to be adversely affected through job losses and the resulting income loss. Income loss will likely result in reduced ability to access healthcare and a nutritious diet, thus adversely affecting health outcomes. Given the foregoing, we hypothesize that the economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus will disproportionately affect the health of the poor. METHODS: Using the fifth wave of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) dataset conducted in 2017 and the first wave of the NIDS-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) dataset conducted in May/June 2020, this paper estimated income-related health inequalities in South Africa before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health was a dichotomized self-assessed health measure, with fair and poor health categorized as "poor" health, while excellent, very good and good health were categorized as "better" health. Household per capita income was used as the ranking variable. Concentration curves and indices were used to depict the income-related health inequalities. Furthermore, we decomposed the COVID-19 era income-related health inequality in order to ascertain the significant predictors of such inequality. RESULTS: The results indicate that poor health was pro-poor in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, with the latter six times the value of the former. Being African (relative to white), per capita household income and household experience of hunger significantly predicted income-related health inequalities in the COVID-19 era (contributing 130%, 46% and 9% respectively to the inequalities), while being in paid employment had a nontrivial but statistically insignificant contribution (13%) to health inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significance and magnitude of race, hunger, income and employment in determining socioeconomic inequalities in poor health, addressing racial disparities and hunger, income inequality and unemployment will likely mitigate income-related health inequalities in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Since independence, African governments have been criticized for either their slow, ineffective, or lack of homegrown solutions when addressing challenges in their respective countries. From economic and development models to dealing with conflicts, governance practices, and planning, overreliance and dependence on external practices which sometimes fail to take into consideration the unique domestic challenges have characterized the response of many African governments. This has, in turn, tainted the image of the continent over their ability to adequately deal with disasters. As the rest of the world is struggling to deal with their share of challenges as a result of the pandemic, it is becoming increasingly important that every country adopts measures that will effectively deal with the spread of the disease. This essay seeks to step back from the seemingly crowded debate over where the next epicentre of COVID 19 will be in Africa and focus on what lessons and measures governments in Africa can adopt during and after the pandemic.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic involving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised the question whether this virus, which is known to be spread primarily though respiratory droplets, could be spread through the fecal-oral route or via contaminated food. In this article, we present a critical review of the literature exploring the potential foodborne transmission of several respiratory viruses including human coronaviruses, avian influenza virus (AVI), parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and Nipah virus. Multiple lines of evidence, including documented expression of receptor proteins on gastrointestinal epithelial cells, in vivo viral replication in gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines, extended fecal shedding of respiratory viruses, and the ability to remain infectious in food environments for extended periods of time raises the theoretical ability of some human respiratory viruses, particularly human coronaviruses and AVI, to spread via food. However, to date, neither epidemiological data nor case reports of clear foodborne transmission of either viruses exist. Thus, foodborne transmission of human respiratory viruses remains only a theoretical possibility.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is now considered a global public health threat. The primary focus has been on reducing the viral spread and treating respiratory symptoms; as time goes on, the impact of COVID-19 on neurological and haemostatic systems becomes more evident. The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID-19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the 'cytokine storm' induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow®, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy. Fruitflow® contains antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory compounds that target the mechanisms of platelet activation specific to COVID-19 and can be considered a safe and natural antiplatelet regime.

AB  - An enigmatic localized pneumonia escalated into a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This review aims to consolidate the extensive biological minutiae of SARS-CoV-2 which requires decipherment. Having one of the largest RNA viral genomes, the single strand contains the genes ORF1ab, S, E,M, N and ten open reading frames. Highlighting unique features such as stem-loop formation, slippery frameshifting sequences and ribosomal mimicry, SARS-CoV-2 represents a formidable cellular invader. Hijacking the hosts translational engine, it produces two polyprotein repositories (pp1a and pp1ab), armed with self-cleavage capacity for production of sixteen non-structural proteins. Novel glycosylation sites on the spike trimer reveal unique SARS-CoV-2 features for shielding and cellular internalization. Affording complexity for superior fitness and camouflage, SARS-CoV-2 challenges diagnosis and vaccine vigilance. This review serves the scientific community seeking in-depth molecular details when designing drugs to curb transmission of this biological armament.

AB  - Saliva has been proposed as an alternative to upper airway swabs when testing for SARS-CoV-2. Although some studies have suggested a higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods, and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that NP swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is small, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference. Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection.

However there may be topics of general interest which do not require censorship and to which outside viewers could be invited. Given the COVID19 pandemic and the need for virtual conferencing, it may be time to reconsider lifting this restriction for certain subject matter. Several platforms exist for live social media broadcasts which enable the broadcaster to exercise direct control over their content without having to go through an intermediary. When fully exploited, these live broadcasts could be of considerable value as another vehicle with which to educate the public about forensic pathology, an opportunity to promote forensic research and most important a recruiting tool to address critical manpower shortages.

AB  - Following the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Canadian healthcare providers were advised or mandated by their regulatory bodies to cease all routine and elective care and only provide emergent/urgent care in March 2020. Two months later, the provincial/territorial governments initiated plans to "re-open" their jurisdictions; however, oral health practitioners are returning to practice in a very different environment, particularly in the domain of infection control and prevention, to the one they left prior to the onset of the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian oral health professional decision-makers at all levels have been making decisions and providing advice and guidance in a highly complex, rapidly evolving environment, often based on imperfect and/or incomplete information. To gather, summarize and present these changes in oral health workplace environments and protocols, the Office of the Chief Dental Officer of Canada has commissioned the development of a multidisciplinary, high-level national expert review document, which resides in the public domain. This document is available for Canada's oral health regulatory authorities, educators, program officials and policy makers.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that struck in late 2019 and early 2020 is a serious threat to human health. Since there are no approved drugs that satisfactorily treat this condition, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials are warranted and reasonable. Drug repurposing is a well-known strategy that seeks to deploy existing licensed drugs for newer indications and that provides the quickest possible transition from the bench to the bedside to meet therapeutic needs. At present, several existing licensed drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and remdesivir have been used because of their potential efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19. Recently, antibiotics such as tetracyclines and macrolides have been reported to be effective against COVID-19. A combination of tetracyclines and macrolides may be a potential treatment for COVID-19 because there are some differences in the mechanism of action of tetracyclines and macrolides.

AB  - The immobilization of patients with a bite block (BB) carries the risk of interpersonal infection, particularly in the context of pandemics such as COVID-19. Here, we compared the intra-fractional patient setup error (intra-SE) with and without a BB during fractionated intracranial stereotactic irradiation (STI). Fifteen patients with brain metastases were immobilized using a BB without a medical mask, while 15 patients were immobilized without using a BB and with a medical mask. The intra-SEs in six directions (anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI), left-right (LR), pitch, roll, and yaw) were calculated by using cone-beam computed tomography images acquired before and after the treatments. We analyzed a total of 53 and 67 treatment sessions for the with- and without-BB groups, respectively. A comparable absolute mean translational and rotational intra-SE was observed (P > 0.05) in the AP (0.19 vs 0.23 mm with- and without-BB, respectively), SI (0.30 vs 0.29 mm), LR (0.20 vs 0.29 mm), pitch (0.18 vs 0.27°), roll (0.23 vs 0.23°) and yaw (0.27 vs 22°) directions. The resultant planning target volume (PTV) margin to compensate for intra-SE was <1 mm. No statistically significant correlation was observed between the intra-SE and treatment times. A PTV margin of <1 mm was achieved even when patients were immobilized without a BB during STI dose delivery.

AB  - The risk of fatal arrhythmias is the major concern for using chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the reported number of life-threatening arrhythmic events or deaths is relatively small. The objective of this study was to assess the arrhythmogenic risk of these two drugs using a multi-scale heart simulation, which allows testing even at high concentrations, including those that cause fatal arrhythmias. We measured the inhibitory action of CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with 30 μM azithromycin (AZ) on six ion currents (fast [INa] and late [INa,L] components of the sodium current, L-type calcium current [ICa,L], rapid [IKr/hERG] and slow [IKs] components of delayed rectifier potassium, and inward rectifier potassium [IK1]) over a wide range of concentrations using the automated patch-clamp system. Using the concentration-inhibition relationship that was thus obtained, we simulated the drug effects while increasing the concentration until the life-threatening arrhythmia, torsade de pointes (TdP), was observed. The obtained threshold concentrations for TdP were 12.5, 35, and 22.5 μM for CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with AZ, respectively. Adding therapeutic concentrations of mexiletine or verapamil successfully prevented the occurrence of TdP, and verapamil was more effective. CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with AZ thresholds for TdP were larger than both anti-viral concentrations that were reported by in vitro experiments and free plasma concentrations that were attained by the clinically used dosage. The current simulation data provided a safety margin to the currently used clinical dose for CQ and HCQ/AZ.

AB  - The widespread of coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new global health crisis that poses a threat to the world. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in bats and was discovered first in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. Immunoinformatics and bioinformatics tools were employed for the construction of a multi-epitope subunit vaccine to prevent the diseases. The antigenicity, toxicity and allergenicity of all epitopes used in the construction of the vaccine were predicted and then conjugated with adjuvants and linkers. Vaccine Toll-Like Receptors (2, 3, 4, 8 and 9) complex was also evaluated. The vaccine construct was antigenic, non-toxic and non-allergic, which indicates the vaccines ability to induce antibodies in the host, making it an effective vaccine candidate.

AB  - The Northwest Mental Health Technology Transfer Center (MHTTC) provides workforce training and technical assistance (TA) to support evidence-based school mental health practices. Historically, this support targeted school professionals through in-person and online trainings, workshops, and coaching. However, in response to COVID-19 restrictions, all support moved to online formats, and the Center introduced trainings for families and caregivers. The purpose of this article is to present preliminary process and outcome data that compare the reach and impact of support before and following COVID-19-related restrictions. Results suggest that transition to online support resulted in a wider reach and a more diverse audience, with no decrease in trainee satisfaction and perceived impact. Furthermore, families and caregivers reported positive gains in knowledge and behaviors following participation in a virtual youth suicide prevention training. Together, these findings suggest that online training and TA can provide tangible benefits to professionals and family members who support student mental health.

AB  - As the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in all countries, there is a growing interest in monitoring and understanding the impact of emerging strains on virus transmission and disease severity. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences collected in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries, as of 12 November 2020. The majority (73.7%) of these sequences originated from four out of 22 EMR countries, and 65.6% of all sequences belonged to GISAID clades GR, GH, and G. We identified ten common non-synonymous mutations represented among SARS-CoV-2 in the EMR and several country-specific ones. Two substitutions, S_D614G and NSP12_P323L, were predominant in most countries. Contrary to previous studies, these substitutions were not consistently associated with increased case fatality rates across the Region. Our study identified critical data gaps in EMR highlighting the importance of enhancing surveillance and sequencing capacities in the region.

AB  - Aim: The economic burden caused by death and disease in the world is credited mainly to tobacco use-currently linked to approximately 8,000,000 deaths per year with approximately 80% of these faralities reported in low and middle income economies. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 7,000,000 deaths are attributed to direct tobacco use, while approximately 1,200,000 non-smokers exposed to second hand cigarette smoke die every year. Accordingly, tobacco use is a major threat to the public health infrastructure; therefore, proper cessation interventions must be put in place to curb tobacco abuse and ease economic and social burdens caused by the tobacco epidemic. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to investigate how scientific efforts have been advanced towards harm reduction among smokers and non-smokers. Relevant articles published during the period 2010-2020 in PubMed, Crossref, Google scholar, and Web of Science were used in this study. The articles were selected based on health impacts of cigarette smoking, tobacco cessation and emerging diseases, including Covid-19. Various cessation strategies have been identified although their efficiency is yet to match the desired results. Results: A series of carcinogenic chemicals are generated during cigarette smoking resulting in serious health complications such as cancer and mutagenesis. The precursors for tobacco induced diseases are toxic and carcinogenic chemicals of the nitrosamine type, aldehydes, polonium-210 and benzo[a]pyrene, which bio-accumulate in the body system during cigarette smoking to cause disease. Rehabilitation facilities, use of drugs to diminish the desire to smoke, heavy taxation of tobacco products and warning labels on cigarettes are some of the cessation strategies employed towards curbing tobacco abuse. Conclusion: The need for further research to develop better methods and research based policies for safe cigarette smoking and workable cessation strategies must be a priority in order to deal with the tobacco epidemic. Campaigns to promote tobacco cessation and abstinence are recommended in this review as a sure measure to mitigate against the deleterious impacts caused by cigarette smoking and tobacco abuse.

AB  - In the era of increasingly defined ontological insecurity and uncertainty driven by the ravages of COVID-19, urban informal settlement has emerged as a source of resilience. Indeed, the effects of a pandemic transcends its epidemiological characteristics to political economy and societal resilience. If resilience is the capacity of a system to adapt successfully to significant challenges that threaten the function or development of the human society, then ontological insecurity is about the lack of such capacity. Drawing on Keith Hartian's understanding of 'informality' of spaces, this policy brief attempts to identify and frame a research agenda for the future. The agenda would assist future researchers and policymakers provide responses that appropriately recognize groups and actors that define the urban informal space.

AB  - The development of effective and safe vaccines is the ultimate way to efficiently stop the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the association of its Spike (S) protein with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells, we computationally redesigned the S protein sequence to improve its immunogenicity and antigenicity. Toward this purpose, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants that perturb the core protein sequence but keep the surface conformation and B cell epitopes. The T cell epitope content and similarity scores of the perturbed sequences were calculated and evaluated. Out of 22,914 designs with favorable stability energy, 301 candidates contained at least two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes and had promising immunogenic potential. The benchmark tests showed that, although the epitope restraints were not included in the scoring function of EvoDesign, the top S protein design successfully recovered 31 out of the 32 major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, where two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. Moreover, the newly designed S protein introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes that do not exist in the wildtype SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrated a new and effective avenue to enhance a target protein's immunogenicity using rational protein design, which could be applied for new vaccine design against COVID-19 and other pathogens.

AB  - Glycosylation, being the most abundant post-translational modification, plays a profound role affecting expression, localization and function of proteins and macromolecules in immune response to infection. Presented are the findings of a transcriptomic analysis performed using high-throughput functional genomics data from public repository to examine the altered transcription of the human glycosylation machinery in response to SARS-CoV-2 stimulus and infection. In addition to the conventional in silico functional enrichment analysis methods we also present results from the manual analysis of biomedical literature databases to bring about the biological significance of glycans and glycan-binding proteins in modulating the host immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis revealed key immunomodulatory lectins, proteoglycans and glycan epitopes implicated in exerting both negative and positive downstream inflammatory signaling pathways, in addition to its vital role as adhesion receptors for SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. A hypothetical correlation of the differentially expressed human glycogenes with the altered host inflammatory response and the cytokine storm-generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is proposed. These markers can provide novel insights into the diverse roles and functioning of glycosylation pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2, provide avenues of stratification, treatment, and targeted approaches for COVID-19 immunity and other viral infectious agents.

AB  - Happy hypoxemia is an unspecified definition that is used in COVID-19 patients to define hypoxemia without dyspnoea. Dyspnoea is a very complex symptom, and although hypoxemia can cause breathlessness, dyspnoea is not related to hypoxemia, but is more closely related to inspiratory drive and mechanical alterations. The lack of dyspnoea in the early stages of the disease is likely related to the absence of increased inspiratory drive due to compensatory mechanisms of hypoxemia, while in the advanced stages there is no evidence of a lack of dyspnoea in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing travel restrictions limit the mobility of proctors, significantly delaying clinical trials and the introduction of new neurointerventional devices. We aim to describe in detail technical and legal considerations regarding international teleproctoring, a tool that could waive the need for in-person supervision during procedures. METHODS: International teleproctoring was chosen to provide remote supervision during the first three intracranial aneurysm treatments with a new flow diverter (currently subject of a clinical trial) in the US. Real-time, high-resolution transmission software streamed audiovisual data to a proctor located in Canada. The software allowed the transmission of images in a de-identified, HIPAA-compliant manner. RESULTS: All three flow diverters were implanted as desired by operator and proctor and without complication. The proctor could swap between images from multiple sources and reported complete spatial and situational awareness, without any significant lag or delay in communication. Procedural times and radiologic dose were similar to those of uncomplicated, routine flow diversion cases at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: International teleproctoring was successfully implemented in our clinical practice. Its first use provided important insights for establishing this tool in our field. With no clear horizon for lifting the current travel restrictions, teleproctoring has the potential to remove the need for proctor presence in the angiography suite, thereby allowing the field to advance through the continuation of trials and the introduction of new devices in clinical practice. In order for this tool to be used safely and effectively, highly reliable connection and high-resolution equipment is necessary, and multiple legal nuances have to be considered.

AB  - SARS‑CoV‑2 is a newly discovered member of the betacoronaviruses and the etiological agent of the disease COVID‑19. SARS‑CoV‑2 is responsible for the worldwide pandemic which has been taking place in 2020, and is causing a markedly higher number of infections and deaths compared to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS‑CoV or MERS‑CoV. Based on updated scientific literature, the present review compiles the most relevant knowledge of SARS‑CoV‑2, COVID‑19 and the clinical and typical responses that patients have exhibited against this virus, discussing current and future therapies, and proposing strategies with which to combat the disease and prevent a further global threat. The aggressiveness of SARS‑CoV‑2 arises from its capacity to infect, and spread easily and rapidly through its tight interaction with the human angiotensin‑converting enzyme 2 (ACE‑2) receptor. While not all patients respond in a similar manner and may even be asymptomatic, a wide range of manifestations associated with COVID‑19 have been described, particularly in vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly or individuals with other underlying conditions. The proper function of the immune system plays a key role in an individual's favorable response to SARS‑CoV‑2 infection. A hyperactivated response, on the contrary, could account for the more severe cases of COVID‑19, and this may finally lead to respiratory insufficiency and other complications, such as thrombotic or thromboembolic events. The development of novel therapies and vaccines designed to control and regulate a proper immune system response will be key to clinical management, prevention measures and effective population screening to attenuate the transmission of this novel RNA virus.

AB  - Racial and ethnic health inequities have been magnified during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Linguistic barriers are a recognized source of health inequities for ethnic minority communities whose health communication needs cannot be adequately met in the majority language. Emergency circumstances, such as respiratory distress and end-of-life care, carry elevated risk of medical error due to miscommunication and are increasingly common during the current pandemic. We have identified three key opportunities to improve health equity for linguistic minority populations as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis: patient and clinician language data collection in health systems, linguistically and culturally appropriate public health messaging, and health care workforce communication skills education.

AB  - Once novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the first case in Japan was reported the following month, telephone inquiries to the Infectious Disease Outpatient Clinic increased. During the first wave of the epidemic, before medical measures for this emerging infectious disease were in place, the Outpatient Clinic received a significant amount of inquiries, reflecting the prevailing social turmoil. During the second wave, inquiries did not increase because a proper system of medical care was in place in hospitals and communities. Therefore, in the early stages of an emerging infectious disease, relevant information needs to be quickly consolidated and it needs to be linked to measures that are appropriate to the situation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, the use of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has rapidly expanded and diversified. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing demand for distance and online learning strategies to support and even replace learning experiences previously afforded by clinical placements and clerkships. An intriguing but under-researched modality is the use of medical reality television to provide authentic experiences of patient care. This strategy does not feature in published medical educational literature, though promising research is emerging from other disciplines. METHODOLOGY: A programme of learning using medical reality television clips to facilitate case-based learning was developed according to the principles of 'anchored instruction', a technology-based educational theory. Clips were taken from the UK television show '24 hours in A&E'. Medical students' learning experiences were investigated using a qualitative approach addressing the following research questions: - What is the perceived emotional experience of medical students when watching reality television in an educational context? - How do medical students relate their experience of watching reality television in a formal educational setting to their perceived learning needs in the clinical environment? A case study research methodology was adopted within the interpretivist paradigm. Data were triangulated from semi-structured interviews with students and non-participant observation of the teaching session. Field notes and transcripts were analysed through an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: In response to the medical reality television, a diverse range of emotions were expressed including: excitement, amusement, concern, nervousness, sadness and joy. Students identified gaps in their clinical knowledge such as interpreting results, practical aspects of prescribing and end of life care. Key themes were increased student engagement and a promotion of holistic care practices. DISCUSSION: Students perceived reality television as a highly realistic and relatable medium and an enjoyable, memorable way to contextualise learning from the classroom to real life, a finding mirrored in previous studies in other fields. The high degree of emotion expressed may explain the improved subjective memorability of the cases. CONCLUSION: Medical reality television offers a unique means of engaging students by providing authentic experiences of patient care and should be valued alongside other technology-enhanced learning strategies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preoperative discussion around postoperative discharge planning have been amplified by the COVID pandemic. We wish to determine if our preoperative frailty screen would predict postoperative LOI. METHODS: This single-institutional study included demographical, procedural, and outcome data from patients ≥65 years who underwent frailty screening prior to a surgical procedure. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frailty Score (EFS). The Operative Severity Score was used to categorize procedures. The Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk-adjustment score as calculated by CMS was included. LOI was defined as an increase in support outside of the home following discharge. Univariable, multivariable logistic regressions, and adjusted post-estimation analyses for predictive probabilities of best fit were performed. RESULTS: 535 patients met inclusion and LOI was seen in 38 (7%) patients. Patients with LOI were older, had a lower BMI, a higher EFS score (7vs.3.0, p<0.001), and a higher HCC score than patients without LOI. Being frail and undergoing a procedure with an OSS ≥ 3 was independently associated with an increased risk of LOI. In addition, social dependency, depression, and limited mobility was associated with an increased risk for LOI. On multivariable modeling, frailty status, undergoing a surgery with an OSS ≥ 3, and having an HCC score ≥ 1 was the most predictive of LOI (OR 12.72, 95% CI: 12.04, 13.44, p<0.001). In addition, self-reported depression, weight loss, and limited mobility was associated with a nearly 11-fold increase risk in postoperative LOI. CONCLUSIONS: This study is novel as it identifies clear, generalizable risk factors for LOI. In addition, our findings support the implementation of preoperative assessments to aid in care coordination and provide specific targets for intervention.

AB  - The use of in vitro 3D organoid/colony forming assay (CFA); which mimics the in vivo environment have provided insight into the mechanisms by which lung stem cells maintain and repair the lung. In recent years, the use of CFA has markedly expanded. However, variations among laboratories in lung cell isolation methods, media used, type, origin, and processing methods of mesenchymal cells used as feeders for the epithelial colonies, and terms utilized to describe and quantify the growing colonies, have caused difficulty in reproducing results among different labs. In this study, we compared several previously described methods for lung cell isolation and culture media, to identify their influence on retrieved cells and growing colonies. We also characterized the effect of freeze/thaw, and propagation of fibroblasts on their ability to support epithelial colonies. Importantly, we suggested markers to identify fibroblast subtypes that offer the best support to alveolar stem cell proliferation. Then, we used our optimized assay to confirm the in vitro identity of recently described epithelial progenitors. We also tested the effect of hyperoxia on lung stem cells, and examined the expression of the receptors for the SARS-COV-2 virus's entry into epithelial cells, on our organoids. In summary, our findings facilitate CFA standardization, help understand how niche cell variations influence growing colonies, and confirm some of the recently described lung stem cells.

AB  - As the worldwide vaccination, it is imperative to minimize vaccine wastage by effectively using all doses available. Vaccine wastage can occur at multiple points during the vaccination process, but it is mainly because the device dead space and the filling process technique. However, there are no studies discussing the waste volume effect of COVID-19 vaccines in clinical practice. There is an increasing COVID-19 vaccine demand that we estimate up to several billion dual doses. The objective of this study was to assess the number of 0.3mL doses obtained from a multiple-dose vial using 1ml and 3ml syringes with different type of needles replicating the first COVID-19 vaccination protocol. Our results suggest that it is possible to obtain six or seven doses from each vial instead five. We provide evidence to optimize between 20% and 40% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 5-dose vials are used, making scarce supplies go further. It is our duty, as researchers, to ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the worldwide COVID-19 vaccination process. However, if standard syringes-needles and technique are used, there may not be sufficient volume to draw extra doses from a single vial.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and posed an unprecedented threat to the global economy and human health. Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an antiinfluenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is found to be superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to the host cells. However, the detailed mechanism through which arbidol induces the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism underlying membrane fusion inhibition by arbidol for SARS-CoV-2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol could generate favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral glycoprotein, resulting in a restriction of the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2 that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.

AB  - The coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) has overwhelmed like a shock wave in a completely unprepared world. Despite coronavirus infections were involved in previous epidemic outbreaks, no antiviral agent was developed for specific treatment. As a consequence, since the beginning of this pandemic, both repositioned and experimental drugs were used to treat the infected patients without evidence of clinical efficacy. Just based on experience coming from the use of antiviral agents to treat other viruses (eg, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir) and supposed antiviral or immunomodulatory activities of drugs with no approved antiviral indications (eg hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab), clinicians have faced the ongoing pandemic. Currently, after about 9 months from the COVID-19 spread, there is still no antiviral agent capable of ensuring the cure of this syndrome. Clinical trials are beginning to confirm the benefits of some drugs, while for other compounds, efficacy and safety have not yet been confirmed. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have denied or downsized the beneficial effects attributed to certain molecules, such as aminoquinolines, largely used in clinical practice at the beginning of COVID-19 spread. Conversely, at the same time, they have provided evidence for unexpected effectiveness of other agents that have been underutilized, such as steroids, which were not used in SARS treatment because of the threatened effect on viral replication. Evidence deriving from pathologic studies have demonstrated that the prothrombotic effects of SARS-CoV-2 can be prevented by heparin prophylaxis, underlining the need for personalized treatment for patients with severe disease. The main aim of this review is to synthesize the available information and evidence on both repositioned and experimental drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, focusing on the need to exercise caution on the use of unproven medical therapies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cancer may cause significant disruptions in normal adolescent development particularly in social domains. Both treatment and survivorship pose challenges to fostering social connections. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review of the experience of social isolation and connectedness in adolescents with cancer and adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted following PRISMA Guidelines. Eligible articles included original peer-reviewed research published in English between January 2000 and April 2020 that reported on social domains of patients and survivors of cancer between the ages of 10-21. Initial database search identified 4606 articles with 43 studies meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Results were synthesized into four domains: (1) the prevalence of connectedness/isolation; (2) risk factors associated with social isolation; (3) protective factors against social isolation; (4) the impact of social isolation on psychological health. Overall, adolescent patients and survivors of cancer have satisfactory social connectedness. However, certain subgroups including those with central nervous system tumors are at higher risk of social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: In general, adolescent cancer patients and survivors report levels of social connectedness consistent with healthy adolescent population norms. The risk and protective factors identified in this review may help serve as important indicators for psychosocial screening and interventions. These findings are particularly relevant in the COVID-19 era as all adolescents face challenges to social connections and psychosocial development.

AB  - COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory illness caused by the virus strain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and until now, there is no effective therapy against COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells, to target COVID-19 from therapeutic angle, we engineered a hexapeptide corresponding to the ACE2-interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS) that inhibits the association between receptor-binding domain-containing spike S1 and ACE-2. Accordingly, wild type (wt), but not mutated (m), AIDS peptide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-κB and expression of IL-6 in human lungs cells. Interestingly, intranasal intoxication of C57/BL6 mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 led to fever, increase in IL-6 in lungs, infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, arrhythmias, and impairment in locomotor activities, mimicking some of the important symptoms of COVID-19. However, intranasal treatment with wtAIDS, but not mAIDS, peptide reduced fever, protected lungs, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of ACE2-to-SARS-CoV-2 interaction by wtAIDS may be beneficial for COVID-19.

AB  - The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread all over the world rapidly and caused a global pandemic. To prevent the virus from spreading to more individuals, it is of great importance to identify and isolate infected individuals through testing. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide. However, performing RT-qPCR is limited to centralized laboratories because of the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment and skilled personnel. Further, it can sometimes give false negative or uncertain results. Recently, new methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis using CRISPR-Cas systems. These methods present rapid and cost-effective diagnostic platforms that provide high sensitivity and specificity without the need for complex instrumentation. Using the CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods, it is possible to increase the number of daily tests in existing laboratories, reduce false negative or uncertain result rates obtained with RT-qPCR, and perform testing in resource-limited settings or at points of need where performing RT-qPCR is not feasible. Here, we briefly describe the RT-qPCR method, and discuss its limitations in meeting the current diagnostic needs. We explain how the unique properties of various CRISPR-associated enzymes are utilized for nucleic acid detection and pathogen diagnosis. Then, we highlight the important features of CRISPR-based diagnostic methods developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Finally, we examine the advantages and limitations of these methods, and discuss how they can contribute to improving the efficiency of the current testing systems for combating SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Observational studies suggest that a heart failure (HF) diagnosis carries a poor prognosis in subjects with severe SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection, but it is unknown whether this association reflects direct myocardial damage due to COVID-19 or the consequence of preexisting cardiac defects and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk burden. Although the close relation between CVD and COVID-19 outcomes is well established, contrasting data exists about the occurrence of HF complications during COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a specific algorithm focused on diagnostic differentiation in acute patients distinguishing between acute HF and acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 is needed. Further, several concerns exist for the management of patients with an uncertain diagnosis and acute dyspnea, the exact relationship existing between COVID-19 and HF. Therefore, the treatment for subjects with both COVID-19 and HF and which criteria may be defined for domiciliary or hospital management, remain poorly defined. Herein, we describe practices to be adopted in order to address these concerns and avoid further virus spread among patients, l and their familiars involved in such patients' care.

AB  - Background: This year has seen the emergence of two major crises, a significant increase in the frequency and severity of hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known as to how each of these two events have impacted the other. A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted to determine the impact of the pandemic on preparedness and response to natural disasters and the impact of past experiences with natural disasters in responding to the pandemic. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 representatives of 24 different community-based programs in southern Louisiana. Data were analyzed using procedures embedded in the Rapid Assessment Procedure-Informed Community Ethnography methodology, using techniques of immersion and crystallization and focused thematic analysis. Results: The pandemic has impacted the form and function of disaster preparedness, making it harder to plan for evacuations in the event of a hurricane. Specific concerns included being able to see people in person, providing food and other resources to residents who shelter in place, finding volunteers to assist in food distribution and other forms of disaster response, competing for funds to support disaster-related activities, developing new support infrastructures, and focusing on equity in disaster preparedness. However, several strengths based on disaster preparedness experience and capabilities were identified, including providing a framework for how to respond and adapt to COVID and integration of COVID response with their normal disaster preparedness activities. Conclusions: Although prior experience has enabled community-based organizations to respond to the pandemic, the pandemic is also creating new challenges to preparing for and responding to natural disasters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot health problems are common in the general population, and particularly so in people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders (RMD). Several clinical guidelines state that people with RMDs should have access to foot health services, although service capacity is often limited. The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for alternative ways to provide patient care. The aim of this clinical audit was to review a newly implemented telephone follow-up appointment service conducted within the Rheumatology Podiatry Department in Leeds, UK. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients attending the Rheumatology Podiatry Department at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust were contacted by telephone approximately 6-8 weeks following initial intervention. During the telephone consultation, all patients were asked pre-defined questions relating to their symptoms, intervention efficacy, the need for further appointments and their preference for the type of consultation. To assess the cost of the telephone consultation the number of attempts needed in order to make successful contact, the duration of the call and the number of telephone follow-up appointments completed in a working day were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (43%) were successfully contacted within the 6-8 weeks stipulated time frame and were included in the analysis. Of the 25 contacted, twelve (48%) patients were successfully contacted on the first attempt. Ten (40%) were successfully contacted on the second attempt. The remaining three patients (12%) required 3 or more attempts to make successful contact. Telephone consultations were estimated not to last longer than 10 min, including notes screening and documentation. Eleven patients (44%) reported an improvement in their symptoms, thirteen (52%) reported no change and one patient (4%) reported their symptoms to be worse. CONCLUSION: Telephone follow-up consultations may be a potentially cost-effective alternative to face-to-face appointments when implemented in a Rheumatology Podiatry Department, and provide an alternative way of providing care, especially when capacity for face-to-face contact is limited. The potential cost saving and efficiency benefits of this service are likely to be enhanced when telephone consultations are pre-arranged with patients.

AB  - The innate immune system, through pattern recognition receptors, intercepts any kind of pathogen and reacts through chemotactic, phagocyting, cytokines-secreting and cell-killing mechanisms in a very quick and effective way. Meanwhile, the adaptive immunity arm, through dendritic and T and B cells memory activation, is alerted and starts, more slowly, to produce antibodies, seen thanks to the progress of immunological investigations in comparative vertebrates, invertebrates, and vegetal models. However, it has been stated that the innate immune system also displays adaptive potential in terms of reinfection resistance through immune memory, in addition to the modulation of responses against repeated low doses of lipopolysaccharides (Lps) or cross-immunization, starting from one pathogenic species and extending to others.

AB  - Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) was recently approved as a smallpox vaccine. Variola is transmitted by respiratory droplets and MVA immunization by skin scarification (s.s.) protected mice far more effectively against lethal respiratory challenge with vaccinia virus (VACV) than any other route of delivery, and at lower doses. Comparisons of s.s. with intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular routes showed that MVAOVA s.s.-generated T cells were both more abundant and transcriptionally unique. MVAOVA s.s. produced greater numbers of lung Ova-specific CD8+ TRM and was superior in protecting mice against lethal VACVOVA respiratory challenge. Nearly as many lung TRM were generated with MVAOVA s.s. immunization compared to intra-tracheal immunization with MVAOVA and both routes vaccination protected mice against lethal pulmonary challenge with VACVOVA. Strikingly, MVAOVA s.s.-generated effector T cells exhibited overlapping gene transcriptional profiles to those generated via intra-tracheal immunization. Overall, our data suggest that heterologous MVA vectors immunized via s.s. are uniquely well-suited as vaccine vectors for respiratory pathogens, which may be relevant to COVID-19. In addition, MVA delivered via s.s. could represent a more effective dose-sparing smallpox vaccine.

AB  - Australia-China relations have been relatively stable over the last decade. However, soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, Australia took an increasingly assertive stance toward China, one that is arguably even more assertive than those of its Western allies. What prompted Australia to adopt a tougher policy against China? This article argues that COVID-19 has brought significant uncertainty to the international system and, hence, to Australia's external environment, which has affected the country's decision-making, accelerating the formation of a hardline policy toward China. A contributing factor behind this policy is Australia's quest for ontological security, which, in the context of COVID-19, has triggered a rise in anti-China sentiment. Meanwhile, this strategy backfired when it encountered China's own nationalism, which exacerbated the widening political chasm, dragging the two countries into an unprecedented diplomatic confrontation. The core of ontological security lies in maintaining the stability of the identity needed for the formation of consistent policy. The uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the familiar external environment and challenged Australia's ability to interpret this new environment and adjust to it, which has triggered ontological insecurity. By analyzing Australia's identity as a middle power in the context of changing regional security and its commitment to certain values, the article shows how COVID-19 has accelerated Australia's quest for ontological security, which has changed the country's China policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: The Zap-X system (Zap Surgical Systems Inc, San Carlos, California) is a radically new surgical robot designed for brain and head and neck radiosurgery. It represents the first new dedicated brain stereotactic radiosurgery platform in almost half a century optimizing the goals of safety, speed, and accuracy. The Zap-X system was used in a required Chinese National Medical Products Administration clinical study. In early January 2020, 2 patients were treated with the Zap-X robot prior to a national COVID-19 lockdown. Both were closely followed via clinical exam and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Prospectively collected data were used to generate this report. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two female patients, each harboring either a trigeminal schwannoma or petroclival meningioma, were treated with the Zap-X robot. Respective tumor volumes were 2.60 and 4.02 cm3. A radiation dose of 13 Gy was prescribed to the 50% isodose line. At 8 mo of follow-up, preoperative symptoms were either resolved or stable and MRI imaging demonstrated a 31% and 56% reduction in lesion volume, respectively. In both patients, symptoms improved, and tumor volumes decreased, whereas no major complication was observed. CONCLUSION: Given only 2 patients and short-term follow-up, any conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the Zap-X radiosurgery robot are preliminary. However, in the absence of any other published outcomes to date, this small case series may be of interest to many radiosurgical specialists.

AB  - December 2019 saw the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread across the globe. The high infectivity and ongoing mortality of SARS-CoV-2 emphasize the demand of drug discovery. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. ACE2 exists as a membrane-bound protein on major viral target pulmonary epithelial cells, and its peptidase domain (PD) interacts SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with higher affinity. Therefore, targeting ACE2 is an important pharmacological intervention for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we described the two-way switch role of ACE2 in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and underlying comorbidities, and discussed the potential effect of the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker on a hypertension patient with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we analyzed the S-protein-binding site on ACE2 and suggested that blocking hot spot-31 and hot spot-353 on ACE2 could be a therapeutic strategy for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the recombinant ACE2 protein could be another potential treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 induced acute severe lung failure. This review could provide beneficial information for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents via targeting ACE2 and the clinical usage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs for novel coronavirus pneumonia treatment.

AB  - COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a pandemic since WHO made the statement on March 11, 2020. The infection is causing a high mortality in old people, especially those with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) or cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Extra cautions are needed in the treatment of those patients. The CVD drugs ACEIs and ARBs, as well as the T2D drugs GLP-1R agonists, were shown to activate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in experimental animals. Elevated ACE2 expression may accelerate virus entrance into the host cells during the infection for its replication. However, expression of the soluble ACE2, may neutralize the virus to limit the infection and replication. Given that obese, diabetes and CVD patients often take those medicines in the treatment and prevention of blood pressure and glucose elevation, it remains to be determined whether those medicines represent friend or foe in the treatment of COVID-19. We suggest that retrospective studies should be conducted to determine the exact impact of those medicines in obese, diabetic, or CVD patients who had COVID-19. Results obtained will provide guidance whether those drugs can be utilized in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetic, or CVD.

AB  - The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world since 2019, causing a global pandemic. The pathogenesis of the viral infection and the associated clinical presentations depend primarily on host factors such as age and immunity, rather than the viral load or its genetic variations. A growing number of omics studies have been conducted to characterize the host immune and metabolic responses underlying the disease progression. Meta-analyses of these datasets have great potential to identify robust molecular signatures to inform clinical care and to facilitate therapeutics development. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available global metabolomics datasets obtained from three countries (United States, China and Brazil). To overcome high heterogeneity inherent in these datasets, we have (a) implemented a computational pipeline to perform consistent raw spectra processing; (b) conducted meta-analyses at pathway levels instead of individual feature levels; and (c) performed visual data mining on consistent patterns of change between disease severities for individual studies. Our analyses have yielded several key metabolic signatures characterizing disease progression and clinical outcomes. Their biological interpretations were discussed within the context of the current literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis of global metabolomics datasets of COVID-19.

AB  - Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the result of massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release and imbalance in the absence of adequate immunomodulation from signals such as interleukin (IL)-10, resulting in ongoing inflammation, tissue damage and death if left uncontrolled. Although CRS can result from different pro-inflammatory insults, the treatments proposed are similar, regardless of the phase of response. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, and CRS has been a defining feature of severe disease. Common approaches to treating CRS in other conditions are now applied to COVID-19 and, although some patients respond, it begs the following questions: (1) are all cytokine storms the same regardless of initiating insult, (2) can treatments be considered equally for all CRS events at any phase of the response, (3) can CRS be predicted based on dynamic acute biomarkers and, (4) should patients with CRS undergo long-term monitoring for secondary effects? The aim of this commentary is not to provide a review of COVID-19 pathophysiology or of cytokine storm, but rather to establish a foundation which could act as a platform to inform treatment approaches to CRS, regardless of cause, and the short- and long-term follow-up which may be necessary for affected patients.

AB  - As of November 25, 2020, over 60 million people have been infected worldwide by COVID-19, causing almost 1.43 million deaths. Puzzling low incidence numbers and milder, non-fatal disease have been observed in Thailand and its Southeast (SE) Asian neighbors. Elusive genetic mechanisms might be operative, as a multitude of genetic factors are widely shared between the SE Asian populations, such as the more than 60 different thalassemia syndromes (principally dominated by the HbE trait). In this study, we have plotted COVID-19 infection and death rates in SE Asian (SEA) countries against heterozygote HbE and thalassemia carrier prevalence. COVID-19 infection and death incidence numbers appear inversely correlated with the prevalence of HbE and thalassemia heterozygote populations. We posit that the evolutionary protective effect of the HbE and other thalassemic variants against malaria and the dengue virus may extend its advantage to resistance to COVID-19 infection, as HbE heterozygote population prevalence appears to be positively correlated with immunity to COVID-19. Host immune system modulations induce antiviral interferon responses and alter structural protein integrity, thereby inhibiting cellular access and viral replication. These changes are possibly engendered by HbE carrier miRNAs. Proving this hypothesis is important, as it may shed light on the mechanism of viral resistance and lead to novel antiviral treatments. This development can thus guide decision-making and action to prevent COVID-19 infection.

AB  - (1) Background: A considerable number of systematic reviews, with substantial heterogeneity regarding their methods and included populations, on the impact of COVID-19 on infected pregnant women and their neonates, has emerged. The aim was to describe the obstetric-perinatal and neonatal outcome of infected pregnant women and their newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Methods: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: September 10, 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); (3) Results: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Reported rates, regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3 and 95.8% for cesarean sections; 4.2-44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3-63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7-32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3-12.7% for PROM and 6.4-16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3-28.5% and 1.4-12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1-76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained almost unchanged, while among our secondary outcomes, maternal ICU admission (3-10%) and mechanical ventilation rates (1.4-5.5%) were found to be relatively lower; (4) Conclusions: Increased rates of cesarean sections and preterm birth rates were found, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved. In cases of symptomatic women with confirmed infection, high maternal and neonatal ICU admission rates should raise some concerns. The probability of vertical transmission cannot be excluded. Further original studies on women from all trimesters are warranted.

AB  - The new severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic was first recognized at the end of 2019 and has caused one of the most serious global public health crises in the last years. In this paper, we review current literature on the effect of weather (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, etc.) and climate (temperature as an essential climate variable, solar radiation in the ultraviolet, sunshine duration) variables on SARS-CoV-2 and discuss their impact to the COVID-19 pandemic; the review also refers to respective effect of urban parameters and air pollution. Most studies suggest that a negative correlation exists between ambient temperature and humidity on the one hand and the number of COVID-19 cases on the other, while there have been studies which support the absence of any correlation or even a positive one. The urban environment and specifically the air ventilation rate, as well as air pollution, can probably affect, also, the transmission dynamics and the case fatality rate of COVID-19. Due to the inherent limitations in previously published studies, it remains unclear if the magnitude of the effect of temperature or humidity on COVID-19 is confounded by the public health measures implemented widely during the first pandemic wave. The effect of weather and climate variables, as suggested previously for other viruses, cannot be excluded, however, under the conditions of the first pandemic wave, it might be difficult to be uncovered. The increase in the number of cases observed during summertime in the Northern hemisphere, and especially in countries with high average ambient temperatures, demonstrates that weather and climate variables, in the absence of public health interventions, cannot mitigate the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks.

AB  - Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome variation using a minimal number of selected informative sites conforming a genetic barcode presents several drawbacks. We show that purely mathematical procedures for site selection should be supervised by known phylogeny (i) to ensure that solid tree branches are represented instead of mutational hotspots with poor phylogeographic proprieties, and (ii) to avoid phylogenetic redundancy. We propose a procedure that prevents information redundancy in site selection by considering the cumulative informativeness of previously selected sites (as a proxy for phylogenetic-based criteria). This procedure demonstrates that, for short barcodes (e.g., 11 sites), there are thousands of informative site combinations that improve previous proposals. We also show that barcodes based on worldwide databases inevitably prioritize variants located at the basal nodes of the phylogeny, such that most representative genomes in these ancestral nodes are no longer in circulation. Consequently, coronavirus phylodynamics cannot be properly captured by universal genomic barcodes because most SARS-CoV-2 variation is generated in geographically restricted areas by the continuous introduction of domestic variants.

AB  - Outbreaks of COVID-19 among nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care facilities in the United States have had devastating effects on residents. Restrictions such as banning visitors, sequestering residents, and testing health care staff have been implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, consequences include a decline in mental and physical health, decompensation, and a sense of hopelessness among residents. We present and explore a case study at an assisted living facility addressing the ethical issues in balancing the management of the community versus the resident's right to autonomy and self-determination. A team of palliative care experts was brought into assisted living facilities to manage patients, care for well residents, and provide input in advance care planning and symptom management. The principles of self-determination and autonomy, stewardship, and distributive justice were explored. The use of nursing skills in triage and assessment, principles in public health, and the 8 domains of palliative care provided a comprehensive framework for structuring emergency operations. Palliative interventions and the role of palliative care nurses played an integral part in addressing ethical challenges in the containment of the virus and the deleterious effects of social isolation among the elderly.

AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to undergo an unprecedented change in a short period. Personal protective equipment such as the face mask or face cover has become a daily necessity. Moreover, since some states and countries have made the use of face covers or face masks compulsory, one cannot ignore or afford to have a wrong or incomplete awareness about face masks. Current information suggests that the two main routes of transmission of the COVID-19 virus are respiratory droplets and contact. This article aims to review the existing information and highlight the need for the use of face masks or face covers to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and promote and provide necessary recommendations. Many countries have implemented or recommended mask wearing in the community, but recommendation for rational use of masks is being issued, as the crisis and shortage for masks are universally existing. The use of different types of masks has been assigned according to the risk of exposure and should be therefore judiciously used. As this is a novel disease, the guidelines are changing every day and one needs to be updated with correct information so that one can protect themselves and their families from this extreme level of the crisis faced by the world now. The use of face covers or masks should not be discouraged as there has been substantial evidence that its use can help reduce the spread of infection. "Mass masking" along with hand hygiene and social distancing are the only effective recommended measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: Scientists are developing new computational methods and prediction models to better clinically understand COVID-19 prevalence, treatment efficacy, and patient outcomes. These efforts could be improved by leveraging documented, COVID-19-related symptoms, findings, and disorders from clinical text sources in the electronic health record. Word embeddings can identify terms related to these clinical concepts from both the biomedical and non-biomedical domains and are being shared with the open-source community at large. However, it's unclear how useful openly-available word embeddings are for developing lexicons for COVID-19-related concepts. Objective: Given an initial lexicon of COVID-19-related terms, characterize the returned terms by similarity across various, open-source word embeddings and determine common semantic and syntactic patterns between the COVID-19 queried terms and returned terms specific to word embedding source. Materials and Methods: We compared 7 openly-available word embedding sources. Using a series of COVID-19-related terms for associated symptoms, findings, and disorders, we conducted an inter-annotator agreement study to determine how accurately the most semantically similar returned terms could be classified according to semantic types by three annotators. We conducted a qualitative study of COVID-19 queried terms and their returned terms to identify useful patterns for constructing lexicons. We demonstrated the utility of applying such terms to discharge summaries by reporting the proportion of patients identified by concept for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COVID-19 cohorts. Results: We observed high, pairwise inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's Kappa) for symptoms (0.86 to 0.99), findings (0.93 to 0.99), and disorders (0.93 to 0.99). Word embedding sources generated based on characters tend to return more lexical variants and synonyms; in contrast, embeddings based on tokens more often return a variety of semantic types. Word embedding sources queried using an adjective phrase compared to a single term (e.g., dry cough vs. cough; muscle pain vs. pain) are more likely to return qualifiers of the same semantic type (e.g., "dry" returns consistency qualifiers like "wet", "runny"). Terms for fever, cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia retrieved a higher proportion of patients than other clinical features. Terms for dry cough returned a higher proportion of COVID-19 patients than pneumonia and ARDS populations. Discussion: Word embeddings are a valuable technology for learning terms, including synonyms. When leveraging openly-available word embedding sources, choices made for the construction of the word embeddings can significantly influence the phrases returned.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialThis study is not a clinical trial.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Dr. Danielle Mowery's University of Pennsylvania discretionary funds.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was reviewed and approved with an exempt status by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (#831895,#843620).All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Since March 6, when Colombia confirmed its first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the country healthcare system, with a limited testing capability, has struggled to monitor and report current cases. At the outbreak of a virus, data on cases is sparse and commonly severe cases, with a higher probability of a fatal resolution, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases. In addition, in an under-sampling situation, the number of total cases is under-estimated leading to a biased case fatality rate estimation, most likely inflating the virus mortality. Real time estimation of case fatality ratio can also be biased downwards by overlooking the delay between symptoms onset to death. In this communication, using reported data from Instituto Nacional de Salud up to December 28, we estimate the case fatality rate for Covid-19 in Colombia and some of its regions and cities adjusting for delay from onset to death. We then apply the method proposed by Russell et al., and use our corrected case fatality rate to estimate the percentage of Covid-19 cases reported in Colombia as 42.95% (95% confidence interval: 42.50-43.41), which corresponds to a total of 3'661,621 estimated Covid-19 cases in the country.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Human Brain Technologies Phone +57 318 407 9118All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has completely transformed the accepted norms and approaches to cancer care delivery in the United States, we sought to understand the sources of medical information that oncology physicians seek and trust. We recruited 486 oncology physicians to an anonymous cross-sectional online survey through social media from March 27, 2020, to April 10, 2020, with 79.2% reporting their sources of medical information during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a diverse array of reported sources for COVID-19 information that most commonly included professional societies (90.7%), hospital or institutional communications (88.6%), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (69.9%); however, trust in these sources of information varied widely, with professional societies being the most trusted source. These results highlight the important role that professional societies, hospitals, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention play in ensuring dissemination of consistent, high-quality practice recommendations for oncology physicians.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is undoubtedly the most challenging pandemic in the current century. A total of 73,953,702 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,644,416 deaths were reported globally up to December 17, 2020. Therefore, in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine, it is urgent to identify a novel antiviral drug to effectively treat patients with COVID-19. On October 22, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity, for adults and children (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) who need to be admitted to hospital for covid-19 treatment. In order to monitor the optimization of patient clinical response profile, as well as address the challenges associated with remdesivir metabolism, highly sensitive, selective and accurate analytical methods are necessary. This review clearly covers all the analytical methods developed for the identification and quantitative determination of remdesivir and its metabolites in biological matrices, which helps the researchers in developing new methods for the analysis of remdesivir by considering the pros and cons of the previously reported methods.

AB  - To tackle the harmful consequences of the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug remdesivir (RDV) has gained the utmost attention recently due to its promising application in treating COVID-19 patients. However, a fast and sensitive analytical methodology is important to monitor RDV drug profile in human plasma for pharmacokinetics (PK) and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). In this study, we demonstrate an improved vortex-assisted salt-induced liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-SI-LLME) technique coupled with UHPLC-PDA and UHPLC-MS/MS for rapid determination of RDV in human plasma. This technique involves simple one-step protein precipitation with hydrochloric acid and subsequent extraction with acetonitrile for analysis. Under the optimal VA-SI-LLME conditions (500 μL of acetonitrile with 2.5 g ammonium sulfate under 2 min vortex extraction), method validation results indicated an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.9969 for UHPLC-PDA (monitored at 254 nm) and 0.9990 for UHPLC-MS/MS (monitored at electrospray ionization with + ion mode transitions of m/z 603.1→m/z 402.20 and m/z 603.1→ m/z 199.90). The detection and quantification limits were 1.5 and 5 ng/mL for UHPLC/PDA, and 0.3 and 1 ng/mL for UHPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The developed method showed excellent extraction recoveries between 90.79-116.74 % and 85.68-101.34 % with intraday and interday precision ≤ 9.59 for both methods. These results proved that the developed method is a simple, fast, and sensitive analytical method that can be applied as a standard analytical tool for PK and TDM studies of RDV in clinical trials during the current worldwide outbreak.

AB  - COVID-19, a new pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. The novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 and the 2002 SARS-CoV have 74% identity and use similar mechanisms to gain entry into the cell. Both the viruses enter the host cell by binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to the host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Targeting entry of the virus has a better advantage than inhibiting the later stages of the viral life cycle. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV (6CRV: full length S protein) and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins (6M0J: Receptor binding domain, RBD) was used to determine potential small molecule inhibitors. Curcumin, a naturally occurring phytochemical in Curcuma longa, is known to have broad pharmacological properties. In the present study, curcumin and its derivatives were docked, using Autodock 4.2, onto the 6CRV and 6M0J to study their capability to act as inhibitors of the spike protein and thereby, viral entry. The curcumin and its derivatives displayed binding energies, ΔG, ranging from -10.98 to -5.12 kcal/mol (6CRV) and -10.01 to -5.33 kcal/mol (6M0J). The least binding energy was seen in bis-demethoxycurcumin with: ΔG = -10.98 kcal/mol (6CRV) and -10.01 kcal/mol (6M0J). A good binding energy, drug likeness and efficient pharmacokinetic parameters suggest the potential of curcumin and few of its derivatives as SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inhibitors. However, further research is necessary to investigate the ability of these compounds as viral entry inhibitors. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - In a world that gradually aids the global interchange of evidence and information on medical training, various educators encounter numerous variations in curricula even though no teaching and training are as universal as medical training. We have read with interest the editorial in the Special Issue of the Anatomical Sciences Education on Anatomy and Covid-19 (Evans et al., 2020). The editors remarked on the swift action of the anatomy community in response to the urgent call from universities: "All hands on deck, we need to move everything online as quickly as possible" (Evans et al., 2020). Since this Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, similar messages were communicated to all educators in medical institutions and universities across the globe (Evans et al., 2020; Smith and Pawlina, 2021). In this letter, we comment on the current Covid-19 situation in medical education in India with particular emphasis on anatomy teaching faculty.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a rapid search for therapeutic and preventive measures. The impetus for this is the potentially severe course of infection. In regard to drug therapies, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, and the anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone, have shown some beneficial effects. Since a COVID-19 vaccine is not currently available, various additional treatment options are being evaluated. One of these, passive immunization, has shown promise in some studies. More research, however, is needed to determine the utility of immunotherapy with convalescent plasma or artificially produced monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of symptomatic patients and potentially for use as post-exposure prophylaxis, at least until more effective drugs or a safe and effective vaccine become available.

AB  - Research on face sensitivity is of particular relevance during the rapidly evolving Covid-19 pandemic leading to social isolation, but also calling for intact interaction and sharing. Humans possess high sensitivity even to a coarse face scheme, seeing faces in non-face images where real faces do not exist. The advantage of non-face images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Here by implementing a novel set of Face-n-Thing images, we examined (i) how face tuning alters with changing display orientation, and (ii) whether it is affected by observers' gender. Young females and males were presented with a set of Face-n-Thing images either with canonical upright orientation or inverted 180° in the image plane. Face impression was substantially impeded by display inversion. Furthermore, whereas with upright display orientation, no gender differences were found, with inversion, Face-n-Thing images elicited face impression in females significantly more often. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face inversion effect in general. Moreover, the findings open a way for examination of face sensitivity and underwriting brain networks in neuropsychiatric conditions related to the current pandemic (such as depression and anxiety), most of which are gender/sex-specific.

AB  - PURPOSE: Strategies for deploying clinical pharmacists to increase access to buprenorphine in inpatient, outpatient and transitional care, and community practice settings are described. SUMMARY: Access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential, but patients face many barriers when pursuing treatment and MOUD. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has compounded the opioid crisis and worsened outcomes by introducing new barriers to MOUD access. Many strategies to ensure continued access to MOUD have been described, but the role of leveraging pharmacists during the opioid/COVID-19 syndemic to improve medication access and outcomes remains underappreciated. Pharmacists, while both qualified and capable of liberalizing access to all forms of MOUD, may have the strongest impact by increasing access to buprenorphine. Herein we present progressive strategies to maintain and extend buprenorphine access for patients with OUD through deployment of clinical pharmacists, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which access may be further restricted. CONCLUSION: Leveraging pharmacists to extend access to MOUD, particularly buprenorphine, remains an underutilized strategy that should be implemented, particularly during the concurrent COVID-19 global pandemic.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a serious global threat to human health and the economy. Based on accumulating evidence, its continuous progression involves not only pulmonary injury but also damage to the cardiovascular system due to intertwined pathophysiological risks. As a point of convergence in the pathophysiologic process between COVID-19 and heart failure (HF), cytokine storm induces the progression of COVID-19 in patients presenting pre-existing or new onset myocardial damage and even HF. Cytokine storm, as a trigger of the progression of HF in patients with COVID-19, has become a novel focus to explore therapies for target populations. In this review, we briefly introduce the basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and illuminate the mechanism and links among COVID-19, cytokine storm, and HF. Furthermore, we discuss drugs and therapeutic targets for patients with COVID-19 and HF.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has seriously threatened human health. Rapidly and sensitively detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses can help control the spread of viruses. However, it is an arduous challenge to apply semiconductor-based substrates for virus SERS detection due to their poor sensitivity. Therefore, it is worthwhile to search novel semiconductor-based substrates with excellent SERS sensitivity. Herein we report, for the first time, Nb2C and Ta2C MXenes exhibit a remarkable SERS enhancement, which is synergistically enabled by the charge transfer resonance enhancement and electromagnetic enhancement. Their SERS sensitivity is optimized to 3.0 × 106 and 1.4 × 106 under the optimal resonance excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Additionally, remarkable SERS sensitivity endows Ta2C MXenes with capability to sensitively detect and accurately identify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Moreover, its detection limit is as low as 5 × 10-9 M, which is beneficial to achieve real-time monitoring and early warning of novel coronavirus. This research not only provides helpful theoretical guidance for exploring other novel SERS-active semiconductor-based materials but also provides a potential candidate for the practical applications of SERS technology.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive global disruptions with considerable impact on the delivery of health services and national health programmes. Since the detection of the first COVID-19 case on 5th March 2020, the Royal Government of Bhutan implemented a number of containment measures including border closure and national lockdowns. Against the backdrop of this global COVID-19 pandemic response, there was a sudden surge of locally-transmitted malaria cases between June to August 2020. There were 20 indigenous cases (zero Plasmodium falciparum and 20 Plasmodium vivax) from a total of 49 cases (seven P. falciparum and 42 P. vivax) in 2020 compared to just two from a total of 42 in 2019. Over 80% of the cases were clustered in malaria endemic district of Sarpang. This spike of malaria cases was attributed to the delay in the delivery of routine malaria preventive interventions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Bhutan is unlikely to achieve the national goal of malaria elimination by 2020.

AB  - Background: Cancer is considered to be an independent risk factor for severe illness and higher mortality in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These adverse outcomes have been suspected to be more severe in lung cancer patients. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to outline patient characteristics, challenges in diagnosis and treatment, and outcomes of lung cancer patients with COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using EMBASE and PUBMED databases using the terms "COVID" and "cancer." Studies that reported clinical characteristics and/or outcomes of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 were then systematically identified. Meta-analysis for COVID-19 related mortality associated with lung cancer compared to other cancer types was conducted. The results were reported as odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) using mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results: The most commonly reported clinical findings in lung cancer patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough, with 68% and 61%, respectively. Laboratory and radiographic findings were consistent with broadly reported data. The meta-analysis noted a statistically significant increase in mortality rate in lung cancer patients compared to other cancer patients, OR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.06-2.48). Lung cancer patients with COVID-19 also reflected greater severity of illness and higher rates of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: COVID-19 in lung cancer patients is associated with severe disease and increased mortality relative to patients with other malignancies and the general population. There is conflicting evidence on the effect of specific lung cancer treatments on outcomes. Until more definitive data is available, lung cancer directed treatment should be continued or restarted as early as possible in mild to moderate cases to prevent worsening cancer-related mortality.

AB  - Modern viral kinetic modeling and its application to therapeutics is a field that attracted the attention of the medical, pharmaceutical and modeling communities during the early days of the AIDS epidemic. Its successes lead to applications of modeling methods not only to HIV but a plethora of other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), which along with HIV cause chronic diseases, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, which generally cause acute infections. Here we first review the historical development of mathematical models to understand HIV and HCV infections and the effects of treatment by fitting the models to clinical data. We then focus on recent efforts and contributions of applying these models towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight outstanding questions where modeling can provide crucial insights and help to optimize non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review is written from our personal perspective emphasizing the power of simple target cell limited models that provided important insights and then their evolution into more complex models that captured more of the virology and immunology. To quote Albert Einstein "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler", and this idea underlies the modeling we describe below.

AB  - Infectious diseases such as the COVID19 pandemic cemented the importance of disease tracking. The role of asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals in driving infection has become evident. Their unaccountability results in ineffective prevention. We developed a pipeline using genomic data to accurately predict a populations transmission network complete with the inference of unsampled sources. The system utilises Bayesian phylogenetics to capture evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. It identified the effectiveness of preventive measures in Canadas Atlantic bubble and mobile populations such as New York State. Its robustness extends to the prediction of cross-species disease transmission as we inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York City Bronx Zoo. The proposed methods ability to generate such complete transmission networks, provides a more detailed insight into the transmission dynamics within a population. This potential frontline tool will be of direct help in the battle to bend the curve.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is partly supported by a CIHR COVID-19 Rapid Response Grant (Q.L., G.v.M., J.G., and P.G.) and a Genome Canada/Alberta Enabling Bioinformatic Solutions Grant (Q.L. and P.G.).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRISS (Institutional Research Information Services Solution), University of Calgary and by the Alberta Health Services.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Objectives: A proper description of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the assessment of protection elicited after both infection and vaccination. Uncoupled T and B cell responses have been described in acute and convalescent patients and exposed individuals. We aimed to assess the potential usefulness of whole blood stimulation assays to identify functional cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Blood from COVID-19 recovered individuals (5 months after infection) and negative subjects was stimulated for 24 hours with HLA predicted peptide megapools of the Spike and Nucleoprotein, or the mixture of them. After stimulation, cytokines were quantified using a beads-based multiplex assay. Results: Interleukin-2 and IFN-γ were found to be specific biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 cellular response. Using the Spike and Nucleoprotein mixture, 91.3% of COVID-19 recovered individuals presented an IL-2 stimulation index over the cut-off, while 82.6% showed IFN-γ. All the negative individuals presented an IL-2 response under the cut-off, while 5.3% of these subjects presented positive IFN-γ stimulation indexes. Moreover, IL-2 production correlated with IgG levels for Spike 1, RBD, and Nucleocapsid. Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential of whole blood stimulation assays and the quantification of IL-2 and IFN-γ for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 functional cellular responses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) in the framework of the project RESEARCH4COVID 19 reference number 460.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We provide a comprehensive overview of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a possible candidate for pharmacological approaches to halt inflammatory processes in different pathogenic conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: ACE2 has quickly gained prominence in basic research as it has been identified as the main entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This novel pathogen causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pathogenic condition that reached pandemic proportion and is associated with unprecedented morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY: The renin-angiotensin system is a complex, coordinated hormonal cascade that plays a pivotal role in controlling individual cell behaviour and multiple organ functions. ACE2 acts as an endogenous counter-regulator to the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways triggered by ACE through the conversion of Ang II into the vasodilatory peptide Ang 1-7. We discuss the structure, function and expression of ACE2 in different tissues. We also briefly describe the role of ACE2 as a pivotal driver across a wide spectrum of pathogenic conditions, such as cardiac and renal diseases. Furthermore, we provide the most recent data concerning the possible role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and dictating COVID-19 severity.

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are blood preparations pooled from the plasma of donors that have been first employed as replacement therapy in immunodeficiency. IVIG interact at multiple levels with the different components of the immune system and exert their activity against infections. Passive immunotherapy includes convalescent plasma from subjects who have recovered from infection, hyperimmune globulin formulations with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). IVIG are used for the prevention and treatment of several infections, especially in immunocompromised patients, or in case of a poorly responsive immune system. The evolution of IVIG from a source of passive immunity to a powerful immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agent results in extensive applications in autoimmune diseases. IVIG composition depends on the antibodies of the donor population and the alterations of protein structure due to the processing of plasma. The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activity of IVIG has led us to think that they may represent a useful therapeutic tool even in COVID-19. The human origin of IVIG carries specific criticalities including risks of blood products, supply, and elevated costs. IVIG can be useful in critically ill patients, as well as early empirical treatment. To date, the need for further well-designed studies stating protocols and the efficacy/tolerability profile of IVIG and convalescent plasma in selected situations are awaited.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised awareness about the vital role school nurses have in improving the overall health of children. School nurses provide health promotion within schools, yet over 60% of schools have only a part-time nurse or no nurse. Nursing students may be valuable partners for health promotion and academic-community partnerships may be mutually beneficial to schools of nursing and local schools. Using a nursing student team to teach hand hygiene while school health staff were present provided an opportunity for hands-on training to help the staff master curriculum content and ensure competency. This article describes a collaborative partnership initiative that expanded access to health promotion education in schools to increase knowledge about reducing the spread of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, while providing valuable clinical experiences for nursing students.

AB  - Objectives The present COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increased need for molecular diagnostic testing. Delay in the specimen processing and suboptimal storage of suspected samples in laboratories leads to degradation of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Viral lysis buﬀers from RNA extraction kits have the potential to stabilize RNA. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in viral lysis buffer at different temperatures and time periods. Materials and Methods Aliquots of samples with known SARS-CoV-2 RNA were processed in viral lysis buﬀers simultaneously, stored separately at 2 to 8°C and 22 to 28°C for 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was extracted from each aliquot and analyzed using multiplex real-time PCR. Results SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples placed in viral lysis buffer was stable for 48 hours at both 2 to 8°C and 22 to 28°C temperatures. Slight decline in the viral RNA quantity was found on aliquots tested after 48 hours of both the temperatures. Conclusions Viral lysis buffer maintains the integrity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for up to 48 hours even at room temperature and supports delayed diagnosis with an overwhelming sample load in testing laboratories.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, evades the human immune system by capping its RNA. This process protects the viral RNA and is essential for its replication. Multiple viral proteins are involved in this RNA capping process, including the nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16), which is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase. Nsp16 is significantly active when in complex with another nonstructural protein, nsp10, which plays a key role in its stability and activity. Here we report the development of a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based RNA displacement assay for nsp10-nsp16 complex in a 384-well format with a Z' factor of 0.6, suitable for high-throughput screening. In this process, we purified the nsp10-nsp16 complex to higher than 95% purity and confirmed its binding to the methyl donor SAM, the product of the reaction, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), and a common methyltransferase inhibitor, sinefungin, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The assay was further validated by screening a library of 1124 drug-like compounds. This assay provides a cost-effective high-throughput method for screening the nsp10-nsp16 complex for RNA competitive inhibitors toward developing COVID-19 therapeutics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is on the rise and causes many concerns and fears in the population as well as among medical care givers. This raises the question as to how psychosocial stress associated with the pandemic can be managed, and also if certain forms of stress can contribute to an increase in infections and critical illnesses. METHODS: Against the background of the current state of research on stress and the immune response, we provide a narrative review of studies addressing the question as to how stress can influence the immune defence against viral diseases. RESULTS: Excessive stress can compromise the barrier function of the airways and alter neuroendocrine control of immune function, which can create a virus-permissive immune response. DISCUSSION: Because certain forms of stress can play a role in the successful immune defence against viral respiratory disease, it is important to identify people with high psychosocial stress and to help them manage their stress. Conclusion Psychosocial measures that contribute to improved stress management may have a positive effect on the immune response against viral respiratory infections.

AB  - COVID-19 has altered clinical clerkships for medical students, providing an opportunity for telehealth with medical students to take center stage in the age of technology. This research brief demonstrates why and how to incorporate medical students into telehealth. For the purposes of clinical students, telehealth is a better educational alternative to in-person patient care than online modules. We performed a successful outpatient family medicine telehealth pilot program at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) that is currently being scaled up to other clerkships. This pilot was very limited in scope, but serves as a scalable model for future telehealth programs and curricula incorporating medical students.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated many painful truths in our state. This commentary addresses some of them, including racism, lack of universal health care access, and defunded public health infrastructure, from the perspective of a local county health department medical director. We have an opportunity to fundamentally improve North Carolinians' collective health, but only if we are willing to reckon with past and current failings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of anesthesia machines as improvised ICU ventilators may occur in locations where waste anesthesia gas suction(WAGS) is unavailable. Anecdotal reports suggest as much as 18 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEP) being inadvertently applied under these circumstances, accompanied by inaccurate pressure readings by the anesthesia machine. We hypothesized that resistance within closed anesthetic gas scavenging systems(AGSS) disconnected from WAGS may inadvertently increase circuit pressures. METHODS: An anesthesia machine was connected to an anesthesia breathing circuit, a reference manometer, and a standard bag reservoir to simulate a lung. Ventilation was initiated as follows: Volume Control, TV 500 mL, respiratory rate 12, I:E 1:1.9, FiO2 1.0, fresh gas flow(FGF) rate 2.0 liters per minute(LPM), and PEEP 0 cmH2O. After engaging the ventilator, PEEP and peak inspiratory pressure(PIP) were measured by the reference manometer and the anesthesia machine display simultaneously. The process was repeated using prescribed PEEP levels of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O. Measurements were repeated with the WAGS disconnected and then were performed again at FGF of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 LPM. This process was completed on three anesthesia machines: Drager Perseus A500, Drager Apollo, and the GE Avance CS2. Simple linear regression was used to assess differences. RESULTS: Utilizing non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis, the reference and machine manometer measurements of PIP demonstrated median differences of -0.40 cmH2O (95%LOA: -1.00,0.55) for the Drager Apollo, -0.40 cmH2O (95%LOA: -1.10, 0.41) for the Drager Perseus, and 1.70 cmH2O (95%LOA: 0.80,3.00) for the GE Avance CS2. At FGF 2 LPM and PEEP 0 cmH2O with the WAGS disconnected, the Drager Apollo had a difference in PEEP of 0.02 cmH2O (95%CI: -0.04,0.08; p=0.53); the Drager Perseus A500, <0.0001 cmH2O (95%CI: -0.11 0.11; p=1.00); and the GE Avance CS2, 8.62 cmH2O (95%CI: 8.55,8.69; p<0.0001). After removing the hose connected to the AGSS and the visual indicator bag on the GE Avance CS2, the PEEP difference was 0.12 cmH2O (95%CI: 0.059,0.181; p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Displayed airway pressure measurements are clinically accurate in the setting of disconnected WAGS. The Drager Perseus A500 and Apollo with open scavenging systems do not deliver inadvertent CPAP with WAGS disconnected, but the GE Avance CS2 with a closed AGSS does. This increase in airway pressure can be mitigated by the manufacturer's recommended alterations. Anesthesiologists should be aware of the potential clinically important increases in pressure that may be inadvertently delivered on some anesthesia machines, should the WAGS not be properly connected.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the requirements for occupational health and safety in the workplace. The aim of the measures implemented nationwide is to reduce the spread of the virus. This applies to all areas of life, including the workplace. The "public service" includes many system-relevant occupational groups: police, fire brigade, judiciary, municipal cleaning, waterworks and administrative bodies at local and state levels. There is a broad diversity of activities in communal and federal state enterprises, especially with regard to internal organisation as well as personnel and spatial conditions. Direct interactions with people are often necessary. Maintaining the functionality of these structures is essential for public life. Education institutions and care facilities for children, people with handicaps and vulnerable groups, institutions for nursing and geriatric care as well as public transport are not covered in this statement due to their special work structures. These recommendations address the professionally accountable in the respective public service institutions. It deals with infection control measures at work in the public service, derived from the risk assessments of various settings. The measures presented can be implemented as part of an operational concept for temporary infection control measures. The aim is to provide general guidance on infection protection with respect to work situations in order to slow down the dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to protect at-risk groups, and ensure the functioning of the aforementioned structures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the associations of age and sex with the risk of COVID-19 in different severity stages ranging from infection to death. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase through 4 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: We considered cohort and case-control studies that evaluated differences in age and sex on the risk of COVID-19 infection, disease severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We screened and included studies using standardised electronic data extraction forms and we pooled data from published studies and data acquired by contacting authors using random effects meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We screened 11.550 titles and included 59 studies comprising 36.470 patients in the analyses. The methodological quality of the included papers was high (8.2 out of 9). Men had a higher risk for infection with COVID-19 than women (relative risk (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12). When infected, they also had a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.27), a higher need for intensive care (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74) and a higher risk of death (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.91). The analyses also showed that patients aged 70 years and above have a higher infection risk (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.81), a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.32), a higher need for intensive care (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.60) and a higher risk of death once infected (RR 3.61, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.84) compared with patients younger than 70 years. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses on 59 studies comprising 36.470 patients showed that men and patients aged 70 and above have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, severe disease, ICU admission and death.

AB  - It took only days to a few months, for the coronavirus to spread across the globe from it's place of origin, Wuhan city, China. Though, India is not among the worst affected countries of coronavirus, it is still a major Public Health emergency which pose a serious threat of crippling the nation's economy. A densely populated country like India, cannot afford getting it's population infected with coronavirus, as that will have an enormous strain in existing healthcare facilities. Although the government of India has implemented complete lockdown, there are many economic concerns to be addressed. Even though, relief fund was announced, the nation's huge population could use additional financial support, to take care of their essential needs like groceries, provisions and medicines. The livelihood, employment and income of many citizens remains questionable. This article attempts to give a socio-economic perspective of the coronavirus pandemic in India.

AB  - Insulin pump training has traditionally been performed in-person. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated vast increases in the number of virtual pump trainings for Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump starts. A customized, structured pump training curriculum specifically tailored to virtual learning was deployed in early 2020, and included a) preparation for training with use of the t:simulator app, b) use of the teach-back method during video training, and c) automating data uploads for follow-up. Retrospective analysis from more than 23,000 pump training sessions performed from January 1, 2020 through July 28, 2020 showed sensor time-in-range for up to 6 months after training was 72% (60%-81%) for virtual training vs. 67% (54%-78%) for in-person training. Higher user satisfaction (4.78±0.52 vs. 4.64±0.68; p<0.01) and higher user confidence (4.61±0.75 vs. 4.47±0.0.85; p<0.01) were reported after the virtual sessions. Virtual pump training was well received, and proved safe and effective with the new virtual training curriculum.

AB  - Present time has been dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. People are grieving several non-death related situations: the loss of a job, of a status, of a role, of their life. Restrictive measures and uncertainty about the future makes individuals vulnerable to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Mental health support has been hindered and teams are reinventing themselves to reach people in need. Nevertheless, decompensation of previous psychiatric disorders, increasing levels of depression and anxiety, economical handicaps and fear of the infection, are prompting several cases of COVID-19 related suicides worldwide. Every suicide affects between 5 and 80 individuals, which are known as suicide survivors. Suicide grief is particularly challenging, with rates of complicated grief as high as 40%. Suicide survivors are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders and of suicidal behaviors. Moreover, feelings of guilt and shame, as well as social stigma, are major obstacles for them to reach form help. This article aims to review the existing literature on COVID-19 related suicides, complicated grief in suicide survivors and highlight modifiable risk factors for both conditions, as well as propose some public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic context on self-inflicted harm and its consequences on families, friends and the community. Obstacles to access to mental health support need to be overcome through the use of technology. Technicians should actively approach populations more vulnerable to develop suicidal ideation. Social media have the obligation to provide accurate an non-sensationalistic information. Families and friends should maintain social proximity, despite the need for physical distancing. When a suicide death occurs, police forces and health staff should be prepared to share the news with the family using an empathic and humane approach and providing psychological support. Funerals, memorials and other services should be held as much as possible. Closer contacts should be signalized and closely followed in order to detect the need for specific interventions. Help seeking behaviors should be promoted. Additionally, people should be educated on suicide and its impacts, in order to reduce stigma.

AB  - Older adults in social housing have high rates of chronic diseases and live in clustered housing, creating the ideal situation for a tragic outbreak in this vulnerable population, which has been largely unrecognized in the public health discourse. It is estimated that two thirds of this population have cardiometabolic conditions that put them at higher risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. In addition, their social isolation, low mobility, low health literacy, and limited internet access are barriers to accessing basic needs, health information, and health care in a Canadian context where many services have moved to virtual platforms. Since older adults in social housing tend to be clustered in apartment buildings with shared facilities, there is an increased risk of exposure through common spaces (e.g., elevator, laundry room) and high-touch surfaces. Compared to long-term care homes, there is substantial movement in and out of social housing buildings as residents are required to go out to meet their basic needs and individuals providing support enter the buildings without screening (e.g., personal support workers, volunteers delivering groceries). Without a targeted public health strategy to support this vulnerable population, we surmise that social housing will be the next COVID-19 hotspot.

AB  - The proposed theory defines a relative index of epidemic lethality that compares any two configurations in different observation periods, preferably one in the acute and the other in a mild epidemic phase. Raw mortality data represent the input, with no need to recognize the cause of death. Data are categorized according to the victims' age, which must be renormalized because older people have a greater probability of developing a level of physical decay (human damage), favouring critical pathologies and co-morbidities. The probabilistic dependence of human damage on renormalized age is related to a death criterion considering a virus spread by contagion and our capacity to cure the disease. Remarkably, this is reminiscent of the Weibull theory of the strength of brittle structures containing a population of crack-like defects, in the correlation between the statistical distribution of cracks and the risk of fracture at a prescribed stress level. Age-of-death scaling laws are predicted in accordance with data collected in Italian regions and provinces during the first wave of COVID-19, taken as representative examples to validate the theory. For the prevention of spread and the management of the epidemic, the various parameters of the theory shall be informed on other existing epidemiological models.

While many surgical and procedural medical subspecialties experienced drastic declines in patient visits during this time, the demand for psychiatric services was more stable. In response to statewide stay at home orders, third-year residents in the psychiatry outpatient clinic described in this article quickly transitioned to telepsychiatry to continue providing care to their patients. While providing care from home, these residents experienced a number of challenges that serve as important lessons for enhancing competence in telepsychiatry services.

AB  - RATIONALE: Management of anxiety, delirium, and agitation cannot be neglected in coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The concurrent use of treatments for COVID-19 and antipsychotics should consider eventual drug-drug interactions OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Three databases were consulted: Lexicomp® Drug Interactions, Micromedex® Solutions Drugs Interactions, and Liverpool© Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP), the CredibleMeds® QTDrugs List was searched. The authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. Additionally, a systematic review of drug-drug interactions between antipsychotics and COVID-19 treatment was conducted. RESULTS: The main interactions between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT-prolongation and TdP, and cytochromes P450 interactions. Remdesivir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics without risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Favipiravir only needs caution with chlorpromazine and quetiapine. Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for coadministration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir because of the risk of QT prolongation and TdP and cytochromes interactions. The systematic review provides highly probable drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir plus quetiapine and ritonavir/indinavir plus risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians prescribing antipsychotics should be aware of the likely risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medication and may benefit from taking into account present recommendations of use to preserve patient safety.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urgent action is needed to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), the prototype of typical antipsychotics from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and acts as an antiviral, in particular against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. The aim of this in vitro study was to test CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Monkey VeroE6 cells and human alveolar basal epithelial A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in presence of different concentrations of CPZ. Supernatants were harvested at day 2 and analysed by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cell viability was assessed on non-infected cells. RESULTS: We evidenced an antiviral activity of CPZ against SARS-CoV-2 in monkey VeroE6 cells with an IC50 of 8.2 µM, a CC50 of 13.5µM and a SI of 1.65. In human A549-ACE2 cells, CPZ was also associated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, with an IC50 of 11.3 µM, a CC50 of 23.1 µM and a SI of 2.04. DISCUSSION: Even though the measured SI are low, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine because of CPZ high biodistribution in lungs and in saliva. Also, CPZ brain distribution could be of high interest for treating or preventing the neurological and psychiatric forms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical findings support clinical investigation of the repurposing of CPZ, a largely used drug with mild side effects, in COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a myriad of interventions with the urgent aim of reducing the public health impact of this virus. However, a wealth of evidence both from high-income and low-income countries is accruing on the broader consequences of such interventions on economic and public health inequalities, as well as on pre-existing programmes targeting endemic pathogens. We provide an overview of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis B virus (HBV) programmes globally, focusing on the possible consequences for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Ongoing disruptions to infrastructure, supply chains, services and interventions for HBV are likely to contribute disproportionately to the short-term incidence of chronic hepatitis B, providing a long-term source of onward transmission to future generations that threatens progress towards the 2030 elimination goals.

AB  - The study of the microbiome data holds great potential for elucidating the biological and metabolic functioning of living organisms and their role in the environment. Metagenomic analyses have shown that humans, along with for example, domestic animals, wildlife and arthropods, are colonized by an immense community of viruses. The current Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) heightens the need to rapidly detect previously unknown viruses in an unbiased way. The increasing availability of metagenomic data in this era of next-generation sequencing (NGS), along with increasingly affordable sequencing technologies, highlight the need for reliable and comprehensive methods to manage such data. In this article, we present a novel bioinformatics pipeline called LAZYPIPE for identifying both previously known and novel viruses in host associated or environmental samples and give examples of virus discovery based on it. LAZYPIPE is a Unix-based pipeline for automated assembling and taxonomic profiling of NGS libraries implemented as a collection of C++, Perl, and R scripts.

AB  - AbstractAIMS: Aims: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused not only global pandemic, but it also pointed at unprepared health care systems and countermeasures were introduced under the pressure of urgent circumstances. This review is focused on discussion and critical evaluation of instrumental tools for COVID-19 diagnosis that were developed in the last months. METHODS: Survey of actual literature and scientific reports was made. The most substantial analytical and diagnostical methods were identified and described. Principles and limitations of the methods are described, and actual papers are cited in this review. RESULTS: Analytical and diagnostical methods like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP), Lateral Flow Immunochromatography Assay (LFIA), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), biosensors and ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay (CLIA) are discussed for assay of viral particles, antigens and specific host antibodies in blood, serum, plasma, nasopharyngeal swab and other samples in order to diagnose COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has spread over the world since the end of year 2019. The global epidemic pointed at the necessity to introduce sensitive methods for instrumental diagnosis of COVID-19 and distinguishing it from the other viral diseases. (Tab. 2, Ref. 96).

AB  - With the COVID-19 pandemic now ongoing for close to a year, people all over the world are still waiting for a vaccine to become available. The initial focus of accelerated global research and development efforts to bring a vaccine to market as soon as possible was on novel platform technologies that promised speed but had limited history in the clinic. In contrast, recombinant protein vaccines, with numerous examples in the clinic for many years, missed out on the early wave of investments from government and industry. Emerging data are now surfacing suggesting that recombinant protein vaccines indeed might offer an advantage or complement to the nucleic acid or viral vector vaccines that will likely reach the clinic faster. Here, we summarize the current public information on the nature and on the development status of recombinant subunit antigens and adjuvants targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a deadly respiratory illness associated with refractory hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. The recent pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is associated with severe pneumonia and inflammatory cytokine storm in the lungs. The anti-inflammatory phytomedicine nimbolide (NIM) may not be feasible for clinical translation due to poor pharmacokinetic properties and lack of suitable delivery systems. To overcome these barriers, we have developed nimbolide liposomes conjugated with iRGD peptide (iRGD-NIMLip) for targeting lung inflammation. It was observed that iRGD-NIMLip treatment significantly inhibited oxidative stress and cytokine storm compared to nimbolide free-drug (f-NIM), nimbolide liposomes (NIMLip), and exhibited superior activity compared to dexamethasone (DEX). iRGD-NIMLip abrogated the LPS induced p65 NF-κB, Akt, MAPK, Integrin β3 and β5, STAT3, and DNMT1 expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that iRGD-NIMLip could be a promising novel drug delivery system to target severe pathological consequences observed in ARDS and COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.

AB  - PURPOSE: The main purpose and research question of the study are to compare the efficacy of high-security closed versus open devices for human oocytes' vitrification. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted. A total of 737 patients attending the Infertility and IVF Unit at S.Orsola University Hospital (Italy) between October 2015 and April 2020 were randomly assigned to two groups. A total of 368 patients were assigned to group 1 (High-Security Vitrification™ - HSV) and 369 to group 2 (Cryotop® open system). Oocyte survival, fertilization, cleavage, pregnancy, implantation, and miscarriage rate were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed on survival rate (70.3% vs. 73.3%), fertilization rate (70.8% vs. 74.9%), cleavage rate (90.6% vs. 90.3%), pregnancy/transfer ratio (32.0% vs. 31.8%), implantation rate (19.7% vs. 19.9%), nor miscarriage rates (22.1% vs. 21.5%) between the two groups. Women's mean age in group 1 (36.18 ± 3.92) and group 2 (35.88 ± 3.88) was not significantly different (P = .297). A total of 4029 oocytes were vitrified (1980 and 2049 in groups 1 and 2 respectively). A total of 2564 were warmed (1469 and 1095 in groups 1 and 2 respectively). A total of 1386 morphologically eligible oocytes were inseminated by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (792 and 594 respectively, P = .304). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the replacement of the open vitrification system by a closed one has no impact on in vitro and in vivo survival, development, pregnancy and implantation rate. Furthermore, to ensure safety, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of the closed device eliminates the potential samples' contamination during vitrification and storage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progress in characterising the humoral immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapid but areas of uncertainty persist. Assessment of the full range of evidence generated to date to understand the characteristics of the antibody response, its dynamics over time, its determinants and the immunity it confers will have a range of clinical and policy implications for this novel pathogen. This review comprehensively evaluated evidence describing the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. METHODS: Systematic review. Keyword-structured searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Articles were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements. Data were double-extracted into a pre-designed template, and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the Public Health Ontario Meta-tool for Quality Appraisal of Public Health Evidence (MetaQAT) tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 150 papers were included. Most studies (113 or 75%) were observational in design, were based wholly or primarily on data from hospitalised patients (108, 72%) and had important methodological limitations. Few considered mild or asymptomatic infection. Antibody dynamics were well described in the acute phase, up to around three months from disease onset, but the picture regarding correlates of the antibody response was inconsistent. IgM was consistently detected before IgG in included studies, peaking at weeks two to five and declining over a further three to five weeks post-symptom onset depending on the patient group; IgG peaked around weeks three to seven post-symptom onset then plateaued, generally persisting for at least eight weeks. Neutralising antibodies were detectable within seven to 15 days following disease onset, with levels increasing until days 14-22 before levelling and then decreasing, but titres were lower in those with asymptomatic or clinically mild disease. Specific and potent neutralising antibodies have been isolated from convalescent plasma. Cross-reactivity but limited cross-neutralisation with other human coronaviridae was reported. Evidence for protective immunity in vivo was limited to small, short-term animal studies, showing promising initial results in the immediate recovery phase. CONCLUSIONS: Literature on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is of variable quality with considerable heterogeneity of methods, study participants, outcomes measured and assays used. Although acute phase antibody dynamics are well described, longer-term patterns are much less well evidenced. Comprehensive assessment of the role of demographic characteristics and disease severity on antibody responses is needed. Initial findings of low neutralising antibody titres and possible waning of titres over time may have implications for sero-surveillance and disease control policy, although further evidence is needed. The detection of potent neutralising antibodies in convalescent plasma is important in the context of development of therapeutics and vaccines. Due to limitations with the existing evidence base, large, cross-national cohort studies using appropriate statistical analysis and standardised serological assays and clinical classifications should be prioritised.

AB  - In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, Belgian health authorities endorsed the interim guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) recommended for treatment of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease. As a growing number of patients were admitted, inevitably, our internal medicine team questioned the efficacy and safety of HCQ, especially with regard to cardiac side effects. In parallel with our concerns, data regarding the safety and efficacy of HCQ were published, with discordant results and debate in the medical community. Media coverage of the possible risks and benefits of HCQ use in COVID-19 also caused confusion amongst the public. In this Perspectives in Rheumatology article, we review the use and safety of HCQ in autoimmune disease and its putative efficacy and toxicity in COVID-19. Finally, we share our concern about the future of this widely used and inexpensive drug after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.

AB  - Introduction: The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a well-established treatment option for the treatment of several viral infections. This in silico study was conducted to target the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 as a target site for aPDT. Methods: SARS-CoV-2-RBD was selected as a novel target for indocyanine green (ICG) as a photosensitizer during aPDT to exploit its molecular modeling, hierarchical nature of protein structure, and physico-chemical properties using several bioinformatic tools. The binding mode of the RBD to ICG was assessed via protein-ligand docking. Results: The results of a computational biology analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2-RBD has 223 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25098.40 Da. RBD is most similar to 6W41 with an E-value of 4e-167, identity of 100%, and query cover of 100%. The aliphatic index of the RBD protein sequences was 71.61, suggesting that the protein is stable in a broad spectrum of temperatures. The predicted structure of RBD showed that it is a protein with a positive charge and a random coil structure (69.51%). Four ligands were modeled in this entry, including one N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG), one glycerol (GOL), and two sulfate ions (SO4 ), to which ICG desires to bind in the molecular docking analysis. Conclusion: Molecular modeling and simulation analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2-RBD could be a substrate for binding to ICG during aPDT to control the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to evaluate the evidence and recommendations for the prescription of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS: Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.

AB  - Older adults with multimorbidity face difficulty accessing healthcare in the COVID era. Palliative care referral may be appropriate to provide additional support for symptoms, advance care planning, or caregiver distress. Since COVID, many palliative care providers have become more accessible through telehealth; however, older adults may have challenges with technology and require caregiver involvement to use. In the inpatient setting, palliative consult teams have assumed a greater role in daily communication with families who cannot visit the patient and in providing emotional support to front-line colleagues. Busy primary clinicians have embraced these efforts, but challenges remain to sustaining these changes.

AB  - Although COVID-19 largely causes respiratory complications, it can also lead to various extrapulmonary manifestations resulting in higher mortality and these comorbidities are posing a challenge to the health care system. Reports indicate that 30-60% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from neurological symptoms. To understand the molecular basis of the neurologic comorbidity in COVID-19 patients, we have investigated the genetic association between COVID-19 and various brain disorders through a systems biology-based network approach and observed a remarkable resemblance. Our results showed 123 brain-related disorders associated with COVID-19 and form a high-density disease-disease network. The brain-disease-gene network revealed five highly clustered modules demonstrating a greater complexity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, we have identified 35 hub proteins of the network which were largely involved in the protein catabolic process, cell cycle, RNA metabolic process, and nuclear transport. Perturbing these hub proteins by drug repurposing will improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity. In the near future, we assumed that in COVID-19 patients, many other neurological manifestations will likely surface. Thus, understanding the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and associated comorbidity is a high priority to contain its short- and long-term effects on human health. Our network-based analysis strengthens the understanding of the molecular basis of the neurological manifestations observed in COVID-19 and also suggests drug for repurposing.

AB  - COVID-19 is characterized by predominant respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Liver enzymes derangement is seen in 15-55% of the patients. Advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, malignancy and, cardiovascular disease predispose them to severe disease and the need for hospitalization. Data on preexisting liver disease in patients with COVID -19 is limited and most studies had only 3-8% of these patients. Patients with metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver (MAFLD) had shown 4-6 fold increase in severity of COVID-19 and its severity and mortality increased in patients with higher fibrosis score. Patients with chronic liver disease had shown that cirrhosis is an independent predictor of severity of COVID-19 with increased hospitalization and mortality. Increase in Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) score and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score increases the mortality in these patients. Few case reports had shown SARS-CoV-2 as an acute event in the decompensation of underlying chronic liver disease. Immunosuppression should be reduced prophylactically in patients with autoimmune liver disease and post-transplantation with no COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir is found to be safe in limited studies in a patient with cirrhosis and COVID-19. For hepatologist cirrhosis with COVID-19 is a pertinent issue as the present pandemic will have severe disease in patients with chronic liver disease leading to more hospitalisation and decompensation.

AB  - This study examined the impacts of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the environment in the Southeast Asia region using qualitative content analysis to analyze the textual data of published studies and other online references such as the organizational reports. Besides, the materiality assessment particularly the Global Reporting Initiative was conducted by analyzing short- and long-term impacts from the stakeholders' (local and regional policymakers) perspective. The positive effects of COVID-19 lockdown and movement restriction on the regional environment identified in this study included a reduction in air pollution, improvement of air and water quality, lower noise levels, and reduced land surface temperature. In contrast, the negative effects encompassed a rise in the use of plastics and the generation of medical waste in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Materiality assessment findings have offered insights on the need of stakeholders' importance for further to deal with huge amount of waste, inadequate waste management facilities and system, explore the effectiveness of such sustainable work and lifestyle changes, utilize real-time monitoring air quality data and future prediction responses for climate change mitigation and adaptation policies as well as consideration towards new green technologies for clean energy in each Southeast Asian country and at regional level. It is anticipated that this study will contribute towards a better understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on environmental sustainability in the Southeast Asia region, particularly from the perspective of the stakeholders.

AB  - Upon vascular injury, tissue damage, ischemia, or microbial infection, intracellular material such as nucleic acids and histones is liberated and comes into contact with the vessel wall and circulating blood cells. Such "Danger-associated molecular patterns" (DAMPs) may thus have an enduring influence on the inflammatory defense process that involves leukocyte recruitment and wound healing reactions. While different species of extracellular RNA (exRNA), including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, have been implicated to influence inflammatory processes at different levels, recent in vitro and in vivo work has demonstrated a major impact of ribosomal exRNA as a prominent DAMP on various steps of leukocyte recruitment within the innate immune response. This includes the induction of vascular hyper-permeability and vasogenic edema by exRNA via the activation of the "vascular endothelial growth factor" (VEGF) receptor-2 system, as well as the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflamed endothelium, the M1-type polarization of inflammatory macrophages, or the role of exRNA as a pro-thrombotic cofactor to promote thrombosis. Beyond sterile inflammation, exRNA also augments the docking of bacteria to host cells and the subsequent microbial invasion. Moreover, upon vessel occlusion and ischemia, the shear stress-induced release of exRNA initiates arteriogenesis (i.e., formation of natural vessel bypasses) in a multistep process that resembles leukocyte recruitment. Although exRNA can be counteracted for by natural circulating RNase1, under the conditions mentioned, only the administration of exogenous, thermostable, non-toxic RNase1 provides an effective and safe therapeutic regimen for treating the damaging activities of exRNA. It remains to be investigated whether exRNA may also influence viral infections (including COVID-19), e.g., by supporting the interaction of host cells with viral particles and their subsequent invasion. In fact, as a consequence of the viral infection cycle, massive amounts of exRNA are liberated, which can provoke further tissue damage and enhance virus dissemination. Whether the application of RNase1 in this scenario may help to limit the extent of viral infections like COVID-19 and impact on leukocyte recruitment and emigration steps in immune defense in order to limit the extent of associated cardiovascular diseases remains to be studied.

AB  - Point-of-Care (POC) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is transforming the management of patients with cirrhosis presenting with septic shock, acute kidney injury, hepatorenal syndrome and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) by correctly assessing the hemodynamic and volume status at the bedside using combined echocardiography and POC ultrasound (POCUS). When POC TTE is performed by the hepatologist or intensivist in the intensive care unit (ICU), and interpreted remotely by a cardiologist, it can rule out cardiovascular conditions that may be contributing to undifferentiated shock, such as diastolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, regional wall motion abnormalities and pulmonary embolism. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in seeking medical treatment, reduced invasive interventions and deferment in referrals leading to "collateral damage" in critically ill patients with liver disease. Thus, the use of telemedicine in the ICU (Tele-ICU) has integrated cardiology, intensive care, and hepatology practices across the spectrum of ICU, operating room, and transplant healthcare. Telecardiology tools have improved bedside diagnosis when introduced as part of COVID-19 care by remote supervision and interpretation of POCUS and echocardiographic data. In this review, we present the contemporary approach of using POC echocardiography and offer a practical guide for primary care hepatologists and gastroenterologists for cardiac assessment in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and ACLF. Evidenced based use of Tele-ICU can prevent delay in cardiac diagnosis, optimize safe use of expert resources and ensure timely care in the setting of critically ill cirrhosis, ACLF and liver transplantation in the COVID-19 era.

AB  - The world is dealing with one of the worst pandemics ever. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that has already spread to more than 200 countries. However, infectivity, severity, and mortality rates do not affect all countries equally. Here we consider 140 HLA alleles and extensively investigate the landscape of 3,723 potential HLA-I A and B restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens and how 37 countries in the world are predicted to respond to those peptides considering their HLA-I distribution frequencies. The clustering of HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequencies partially separates most countries with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants from the other countries. We further correlated the patterns of in silico predicted population coverage and epidemiological data. The number of deaths per million inhabitants correlates to the predicted antigen coverage of S and N derived peptides and its module is influenced if a given set of frequent or rare HLA alleles are analyzed in a given population. Moreover, we highlighted a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with an elevated number of deaths per million inhabitants. In addition, we identified three potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the four-length insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains. We believe these data can contribute to the search for peptides with the potential to be used in vaccine strategies considering the role of herd immunity to hamper the spread of the disease. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use a populational approach in association with COVID-19 outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: First, to review the principles and practice of disaster psychiatry, in light of recent global events. Second, to identify opportunities for research. METHOD: A literature review of the MEDLINE database, UpToDate and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Reference lists were also reviewed. RESULTS: Psychiatrists are well-positioned to contribute to positive outcomes at all stages of the disaster response. These contributions derive from their roles as doctors, mental illness specialists and clinical leaders. CONCLUSION: A novel framework for the psychiatrist's contributions was proposed. Specific knowledge of disaster psychiatry may be worthwhile, and establishment of a public disaster psychiatry centre is reasonable. Research should further examine the role of tele-psychiatry and pursue a best practice for community and front-line employee psychological preparedness.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe and critically discuss the most recent evidence regarding the stone management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and post-COVID-19 era. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a need to plan for resuming the normal elective stone surgery in the post-COVID era, keeping a clear record of all surgeries that is being deferred and identifying subgroups of surgical priorities, as for the de-escalation phase.Telehealth is very useful because it contributes to reduce virus dissemination guaranteeing at the same time an adequate response to patients' care needs. Once the pandemic is over, teleurology will continue to be utilized to offer cost-effective care to urological patients and it will be totally integrated in our clinical practice. SUMMARY: This COVID-19 pandemic represents a real challenge for all national health providers: on the one hand, every effort should be made to assist COVID patients, while on the other hand we must remember that all other diseases have not disappeared in the meanwhile and they will urgently need to be treated as soon as the pandemic is more under control.A correct prioritization of cases when surgical activity will progressively return back to normality is of paramount importance.

AB  - SARS CoV-2 and its associated disease COVID-19 has devastated the world during 2020. Masks and social distancing could be efficient if done by large proportions of the population, but pandemic fatigue has decreased their efficacy. Economic shut downs come with large price tags and cannot be a long term solution either. The announcements by three vaccine manufacturers in November that their vaccines are 90% or more effective has given hope to at least those in the population who plan to get vaccinated as soon as a scientifically and medically sound vaccine becomes available. This review summarizes the underlying design strategies and current status of development of the nine vaccines that were in phase III trial on 8 November 2020. Contracts between vaccine manufacturing companies and governments aim at distributing the vaccine to a large part of the world population. Questions remain how the temperature sensitive mRNA vaccines will be transported and/or stored and how vaccination will be prioritized within each country. Additionally, current contracts do not cover all countries, with a serious gap in Africa and South America. The second part of this review will detail current distribution plans and remaining challenges with vaccine accessibility and acceptance.

AB  - Proteomics studies allow for the determination of the identity, amount, and interactions of proteins under specific conditions that allow the biological state of an organism to ultimately change. These conditions can be either beneficial or detrimental. Diseases are due to detrimental changes caused by either protein overexpression or underexpression caused by as a result of a mutation or posttranslational modifications (PTM), among other factors. Identification of disease biomarkers through proteomics can be potentially used as clinical information for diagnostics. Common biomarkers to look for include PTM. For example, aberrant glycosylation of proteins is a common marker and will be a focus of interest in this review. A common way to analyze glycoproteins is by glycoproteomics involving mass spectrometry. Due to factors such as micro- and macroheterogeneity which result in a lower abundance of each version of a glycoprotein, it is difficult to obtain meaningful results unless rigorous sample preparation procedures are in place. Microheterogeneity represents the diversity of glycans at a single site, whereas macroheterogeneity depicts glycosylation levels at each site of a protein. Enrichment and derivatization of glycopeptides help to overcome these limitations. Over the time range of 2016 to 2020, several methods have been proposed in the literature and have contributed to drastically improve the outcome of glycosylation analysis, as presented in the sampling surveyed in this review. As a current topic in 2020, glycoproteins carried by pathogens can also cause disease and this is seen with SARS CoV2, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. This review will discuss glycoproteomic studies of the spike glycoprotein and interacting proteins such as the ACE2 receptor.

AB  - Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, the use of telemedicine applications has increased throughout the United States. Using an algorithm to analyze mobile application rankings, we were able to examine how applications with telemedicine services have increased in prevalence and rank pre- and post- COVID-19. Telemedicine apps saw an increase of 210.92 ranked positions on average. Within US telehealth, skin conditions have become the fifth most common diagnosis. Widespread use of teledermatology has been well-accepted. Dermatologists and patients report high satisfaction using teledermatology during COVID-19 and intend to continue using these services in the future. COVID-19 has assisted in reducing physician concerns previously preventing some dermatologists from utilizing teledermatology in their services. Additionally, the geographical and socioeconomic barriers preventing some patients from receiving dermatologic care have been minimized through the use of teledermatology. Addressing these obstacles for dermatologic care improves healthcare equity.

AB  - The recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the associated ongoing pandemic, frequently leads to severe respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia with fatal consequences. Although several factors of this infection and its consequences are not completely clear, the presence and involvement of specific chemokines is undoubtedly crucial for the development and progression of COVID-19. Cytokine storm and the often-resulting cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are pathophysiological hallmarks in COVID-19 infections related to its most severe and fatal cases. In this hyperinflammatory event, chemokines and other cytokines are highly upregulated and are therefore not fulfilling their beneficial function in the host response anymore but causing harmful effects. Here, we present the recent views on the involvement of chemokines and selected cytokines in COVID-19 and the therapeutics currently in clinical development targeting or interfering with them, discussing their potentials in the treatment of COVID-19 infections.

AB  - The novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has spread across the globe at an unprecedented rate since its first emergence in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. Scientific communities around the world have been rigorously working to develop a potent vaccine to combat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), employing conventional and novel vaccine strategies. Gene-based vaccine platforms based on viral vectors, DNA, and RNA, have shown promising results encompassing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in previous studies, supporting their implementation for COVID-19 vaccine development. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently authorized the emergency use of two RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. We review current gene-based vaccine candidates proceeding through clinical trials, including their antigenic targets, delivery vehicles, and route of administration. Important features of previous gene-based vaccine developments against other infectious diseases are discussed in guiding design and development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and future derivatives.

AB  - The sanitary emergency generated by the pandemic COVID-19, instigates the search for scientific strategies to mitigate the damage caused by the disease to different sectors of society. The disease caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, reached 216 countries/territories, where about 20 million people were reported with the infection. Of these, more than 740,000 died. In view of the situation, strategies involving the development of new antiviral molecules are extremely important. The present work evaluated, through molecular docking assays, the interactions of 4'-acetamidechalcones with enzymatic and structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 and with the host's ACE2, which is recognized by the virus, facilitating its entry into cells. Therefore, it was observed that, regarding the interactions of chalcones with Main protease (Mpro), the chalcone N-(4'[(2E)-3-(4-flurophenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPF) has the potential for coupling in the same region as the natural inhibitor FJC through strong hydrogen bonding. The formation of two strong hydrogen bonds between N-(4[(2E)-3-(phenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAB) and the NSP16-NSP10 heterodimer methyltransferase was also noted. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPM) and N-(4-[(2E)-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-1-(phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPE) chalcones showed at least one strong intensity interaction of the SPIKE protein. N-(4[(2E)-3-(4-dimetilaminophenyl)-1-(phenyl)-prop-2-en-1-one]) acetamide (PAAPA) chalcone had a better affinity with ACE2, with strong hydrogen interactions. Together, our results suggest that 4'-acetamidechalcones inhibit the interaction of the virus with host cells through binding to ACE2 or SPIKE protein, probably generating a steric impediment. In addition, chalcones have an affinity for important enzymes in post-translational processes, interfering with viral replication.

AB  - To date, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors have been exploited in numerous different contexts while continuously pushing boundaries in terms of improved sensitivity, specificity, portability and reusability. The latter has attracted attention as a viable alternative to disposable biosensors, also offering prospects for rapid screening of biomolecules or biomolecular interactions. In this context here, we developed an approach to successfully regenerate a fiber-optic (FO)-SPR surface when utilizing cobalt (II)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) surface chemistry. To achieve this, we tested multiple regeneration conditions that can disrupt the NTA chelate on a surface fully saturated with His6-tagged antibody fragments (scFv-33H1F7) over ten regeneration cycles. The best surface regeneration was obtained when combining 100 mM EDTA, 500 mM imidazole and 0.5% SDS at pH 8.0 for 1 min with shaking at 150 rpm followed by washing with 0.5 M NaOH for 3 min. The true versatility of the established approach was proven by regenerating the NTA surface for ten cycles with three other model system bioreceptors, different in their size and structure: His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 spike fragment (receptor binding domain, RBD), a red fluorescent protein (RFP) and protein origami carrying 4 RFPs (Tet12SN-RRRR). Enabling the removal of His6-tagged bioreceptors from NTA surfaces in a fast and cost-effective manner can have broad applications, spanning from the development of biosensors and various biopharmaceutical analyses to the synthesis of novel biomaterials.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 pandemic has brought about an overabundance of misinformation concerning the virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) it causes spreading rapidly on social media. While some more obviously untrustworthy sources may be easier for social media filters to identify and remove, an early feature was the cobranding of COVID-19 misinformation with other types of misinformation. To examine this, the top 10 Instagram posts (in English) were collected every day for 10 days (April 21-30th, 2020) for each of the hashtags #hoax, #governmentlies, and #plandemic. The #hoax was selected first as it is commonly used in conspiracy theory posts, and #governmentlies because it was the most commonly cotagged with #hoax. For comparison, we selected #plandemic as the most popular cotagged hashtag that was clearly COVID-19-related. This resulted in 300 Instagram posts available for our analysis. We conducted a content analysis by coding the themes contained in the posts, both for the images and the text caption shared by the Instagram users (including hashtags). The broad theme of general mistrust was the most common, including the idea that the government and/or media has fabricated or hidden information pertaining to COVID-19. Conspiracy theories were the second-most frequent theme among posts. Overall, COVID-19 was frequently presented in association with authority-questioning beliefs. Developing an understanding of how the public shares misinformation on COVID-19 alongside conspiracy theories and authority-questioning statements can aid public health officials and policymakers in limiting the spread of potentially life-threatening health misinformation.

AB  - Introduction: Patients affected by Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) represent a potential group-at-risk in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Studies on large and small cohorts of IEI reported a huge variability clinical manifestations associated to SARS-Cov-2, ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate/severe to death. A great impulse to improve remote assistance programs and to switch to home-based treatment to reduce mobility and face to face contacts has been implemented. Areas covered: The authors completed a comprehensive review of the literature by searching the PubMed database for studies on large and small cohorts and case reports of IEI patients with COVID-19, with the aim to provide useful information for their clinical management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expert opinion: Surprisingly, a low number of IEI patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 were reported with a risk to die for COVID-19 overlapping that of the general population. The low number might be explained by the choice of most physicians to inform early in the pandemic about safety measures, to switch most of the IEI patients to home therapy and to remote assistance. The guidelines issued by the scientific societies and periodically updated, represent the best tool for the clinical management of IEI patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease has extended its involvement beyond the respiratory system, with increasing reports of involving different systems, such as Nervous System. The neuroinvasive potential of this pathogen would be explained by its neurotropism given the presence of ACE2 receptors in the brain and spinal cord, in addition to the important systemic inflammatory involvement. The neu rological involvement due to infection is divided between the central nervous system, highlighting non-specific and mild symptoms such as dizziness and headache, as well as severe symptoms with encephalitis and cerebrovascular pathology, and the peripheral nervous system, which mainly pre sents anosmia, ageusia, and myositis. Clinical symptomatology in pediatric patients seems to be less than in adults, but there is a growing report in the literature regarding these findings. There fore, it is very important to have an adequate registry and anamnesis that allow early identification of neurological involvement.

AB  - Designing anticoronavirus disease 2019 (anti-COVID-19) agents is the primary concern of medicinal chemists/drug designers nowadays. Repurposing of known active compounds against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new effective and time-saving trend in anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Thorough inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget inhibition) is a possible powerful favorable strategy for developing effectively potent drugs for COVID-19. In this new research study, I succeeded to repurpose the two antioxidant polyhydroxy-1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the first multitarget coronaviral protein blockers with extremely higher potencies (reach about 65 and 304 times, for CoViTris2020, and 20 and 93 times, for ChloViD2020, more potent than remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively). These two 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were computationally studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins) and biologically assessed (through a newly established robust in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay) for their anticoronaviral-2 bioactivities. The data obtained from the docking investigation showed that both ligands promisingly exhibited very strong inhibitory binding affinities with almost all docked enzymes (e.g., they displayed extremely lower binding energies of - 12.00 and - 9.60 kcal/mol, respectively, with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase "RdRp"). The results of the biological assay revealed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 significantly displayed very high anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively). Further in vivo/clinical studies for the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 medications are required. In brief, the ascent of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the two lead members of the novel family of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives represents a promising hope in COVID-19 therapy. CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with surprising EC50 values of 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively. CoViTris2020 strongly inhibits coronaviral-2 RdRp with exceptionally lower inhibitory binding energy of - 12.00 kcal/mol.

AB  - Global health and its predecessors, tropical medicine and international health, have historically been driven by the agendas of institutions in high-income countries (HICs), with power dynamics that have disadvantaged partner institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Since the 2000s, however, the academic global health community has been moving toward a focus on health equity and reexamining the dynamics of global health education (GHE) partnerships. Whereas GHE partnerships have largely focused on providing opportunities for learners from HIC institutions, LMIC institutions are now seeking more equitable experiences for their trainees. Additionally, lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore already important lessons about the value of bidirectional educational exchange, as regions gain new insights from one another regarding strategies to impact health outcomes. Interruptions in experiential GHE programs due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions provide an opportunity to reflect on existing GHE systems, to consider the opportunities and dynamics of these partnerships, and to redesign these systems for the equitable benefit of the various partners. In this commentary, the authors offer recommendations for beginning this process of change, with an emphasis on restructuring GHE relationships and addressing supremacist attitudes at both the systemic and individual levels.

AB  - Most children with COVID-19 have asymptomatic or mild illness. Those who become critically ill suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI). The rapid deterioration of lung function has been linked to microangiopathic and immune-mediated processes seen in the lungs of adult patients with COVID-19. The role of complement-mediated acute lung injury is supported by animal models of SARS-CoV, evaluation of lung tissue in those who died from COVID-19 and response of COVID-19 ARDS to complement inhibition. We present a summary of a child with COVID-19 disease treated with convalescent plasma and eculizumab and provide a detailed evaluation of the inflammatory pathways.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Primarily an infection of the lower respiratory tract, it is now well known to cause multisystem abnormalities. Hematologic manifestations constitute a significant area of concern. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infects monocytes and endothelial cells leading to a complex downstream cascade, cytokine storm, and eventual intravascular thrombosis. Coronavirus disease 2019 causes lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia. Prophylactic anticoagulation is vital in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, as its effect on the coagulation system is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease can cause both arterial and venous thromboses, especially pulmonary embolism and pulmonary microthrombi. A high index of suspicion is indispensable in recognizing these complications, and timely institution of therapeutic anticoagulation is vital in treating them. Virus-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon but shares some similarities to sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. Marked elevations in hematologic biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, ferritin, and C-reactive protein are associated with worse outcomes. Understanding the pathophysiology and recognizing factors associated with poor prognosis are crucial in improving patient outcomes with coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - The global crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) affected economics, social affairs, and the environment, not to mention public health. It is estimated that near 82% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The purpose of the review is to highlight how the virus is impacted by the environment and how the virus has impacted the environment. This review was based on an electronic search of the literature in the Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed database published from December 2019 to July 2020 using combinations of the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 transmission, coronavirus transmission, waterborne, wastewater, airborne, fomites, and fecal-oral transmission. Studies suggest the thermal properties of ambient air, as well as relative humidity, may affect the transmissibility and viability of the virus. Samples taken from the wastewater collection network were detected contaminated with the novel coronavirus; consequently, there is a concern of its transmission via an urban sewer system. There are concerns about the efficacy of the wastewater treatment plant disinfection process as the last chance to inactivate the virus. Handling solid waste also requires an utmost caution as it may contain infectious masks, etc. Following the PRISMA approach, among all reviewed studies, more than 36% of them were directly or indirectly related to the indoor and outdoor environment, 16% to meteorological factors, 11% to wastewater, 14% to fomites, 8% to water, 9% to solid waste, and 6% to the secondary environment. The still growing body of literature on COVID-19 and air, suggests the importance of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via air and indoor air quality, especially during lockdown interventions. Environmental conditions are found to be a factor in transmitting the virus beyond geographical borders. Accordingly, countries need to pay extra attention to sustainable development themes and goals.

AB  - Emerging beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID19) are responsible for acute respiratory illnesses in human. The epidemiological features of the SARS, MERS, and new COVID-19 have revealed sex-dependent variations in the infection, frequency, treatment, and fatality rates of these syndromes. Females are likely less susceptible to viral infections, perhaps due to their steroid hormone levels, the impact of X-linked genes, and the sex-based immune responses. Although mostly inactive, the X chromosome makes the female's immune system more robust. The extra immune-regulatory genes of the X chromosome are associated with lower levels of viral load and decreased infection rate. Moreover, a higher titer of the antibodies and their longer blood circulation half-life are involved in a more durable immune protection in females. The activation rate of the immune cells and the production of TLR7 and IFN are more prominent in females. Although the bi-allelic expression of the immune regulatory genes can sometimes lead to autoimmune reactions, the higher titer of TLR7 in females is further associated with a stronger anti-viral immune response. Considering these sex-related differences and the similarities between the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, we will discuss them in immune responses against the β-CoVs-associated syndromes. We aim to provide information on sex-based disease susceptibility and response. A better understanding of the evasion strategies of pathogens and the host immune responses can provide worthful insights into immunotherapy, and vaccine development approaches.

AB  - In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities in India presented a contradictory picture between their role in assisting the state to mitigate the global crisis and dealing coercively with the needs of its diverse populations. Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a 'great leveller'. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, 'social distancing' is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the host cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Other important proteins involved in this process include disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) also known as tumour necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme and transmembrane serine protease 2. ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin (1-7), to balance the renin angiotensin system. Membrane-bound ACE2 ectodomain shedding is mediated by ADAM17 upon viral spike binding, Ang II overproduction and in several diseases. The shed soluble ACE2 (sACE2) retains its catalytic activity, but its precise role in viral entry is still unclear. Therapeutic sACE2 is claimed to exert dual effects; reduction of excess Ang II and blocking viral entry by masking the spike protein. Nevertheless, the paradox is why SARS-CoV-2 comorbid patients struggle to attain such benefit in viral infection despite having a high amount of sACE2. In this review, we discuss the possible detrimental role of sACE2 and speculate on a series of events where protease primed or non-primed virus-sACE2 complex might enter the host cell. As extracellular virus can bind many sACE2 molecules, sACE2 level could be reduced drastically upon endocytosis by the host cell. A consequential rapid rise in Ang II level could potentially aggravate disease severity through Ang II-angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) axis in comorbid patients. Hence, monitoring sACE2 and Ang II level in coronavirus disease 2019 comorbid patients are crucial to ensure safe and efficient intervention using therapeutic sACE2 and vaccines.

AB  - COVID 19 pandemic has posed challenges for public mental healthcare delivery, particularly in LAMI countries such as India. However, this unique situation has also brought in opportunities to revisit the health system and optimally utilize the available resources. In this brief report, we report one such new initiative in which existing community health workers (CHWs), known as ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activist) acted as a bridge between patients with mental illness and the District Mental Health Program (DMHP) of Ramanagara district of Karnataka State, India. They maintained continuity of care of 76 patients by delivering mental healthcare services to the patients' doorstep. This has paved the way to rethink and revisit their role in public mental healthcare delivery not only during COVID 19 times, but also beyond.

AB  - COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19. KEY POINTS : • Provides comprehensive information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Like with all cancers, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings are the norm in bone and soft tissue tumour (BST) management too. Problem in attendance of specialists due to geographical location is the one of the key barriers to effective functioning of MDTs. To overcome this problem, virtual MDTs involving videoconferencing or telemedicine have been proposed, but however this has been seldom used and tested. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the implementation of virtual MDTs in the Oxford sarcoma service in order to maintain normal service provision. We conducted a survey among the participants to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: An online questionnaire comprising of 24 questions organised into 4 sections was circulated among all participants of the MDT after completion of 8 virtual MDTs. Opinions were sought comparing virtual MDTs to the conventional face-to-face MDTs on various aspects. A total of 36 responses were received and were evaluated. RESULTS: 72.8% were satisfied with the depth of discussion in virtual MDTs and 83.3% felt that the decision-making in diagnosis had not changed following the switch from face-to-face MDTs. About 86% reported to have all essential patient data was available to make decisions and 88.9% were satisfied with the time for discussion of patient issues over virtual platform. Three-fourths of the participants were satisfied (36.1% - highly satisfied; 38.9% - moderately satisfied) with virtual MDTs and 55.6% of them were happy to attend MDTs only by the virtual platform in the future. Regarding future, 77.8% of the participants opined that virtual MDTs would be the future of cancer care and an overwhelming majority (91.7%) felt that the present exercise would serve as a precursor to global MDTs involving specialists from abroad in the future. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the forced switch to virtual MDTs in sarcoma care following the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic to be a viable and effective alternative to conventional face-to-face MDTs. With effective and efficient software in place, virtual MDTs would also facilitate in forming extended MDTs in seeking opinions on complex cases from specialists abroad and can expand cancer care globally.

AB  - When we are practicing, especially in rural India, we often face problems of instrument failure or lost instrument, etc... which may sometimes necessitate abandoning the procedure just because of the lack of a single instrument. We do mobile laparoscopic surgery, carrying all the laparoscopic instruments to far-off places, as far as 60-80 km. On one such occasion, my staff had lost a 5-mm trocar, which had gone unnoticed until I posted a case for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There was not much time to buy a new one and also it was difficult to procure from the dealer because of the COVID-19 situation. Just because of the lack of one instrument we were facing a situation of postponing laparoscopy!

AB  - The factors affecting the penetration of certain diseases such as COVID-19 in society are still unknown. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can play a crucial role during the time of crisis and they can provide a more holistic view of the reasons that govern the outbreak of a contagious disease. The understanding of COVID-19 will be enriched by the analysis of data related to the phenomena, and this data can be collected using IoT sensors. In this paper, we show an integrated solution based on IoT technologies that can serve as opportunistic health data acquisition agents for combating the pandemic of COVID-19, named CIoTVID. The platform is composed of four layers-data acquisition, data aggregation, machine intelligence and services, within the solution. To demonstrate its validity, the solution has been tested with a use case based on creating a classifier of medical conditions using real data of voice, performing successfully. The layer of data aggregation is particularly relevant in this kind of solution as the data coming from medical devices has a very different nature to that coming from electronic sensors. Due to the adaptability of the platform to heterogeneous data and volumes of data; individuals, policymakers, and clinics could benefit from it to fight the propagation of the pandemic.

AB  - As September marks the start of the malaria season in South Africa (SA), it is essential that healthcare professionals consider both COVID- 19 and malaria when a patient who lives in or has recently travelled to a malaria area presents with acute febrile illness. Early diagnosis of malaria by either a rapid diagnostic test or microscopy enables prompt treatment with the effective antimalarial, artemether-lumefantrine, preventing progression to severe disease and death. Intravenous artesunate is the preferred treatment for severe malaria in both children and adults. Adding single low-dose primaquine to standard treatment is recommended in endemic areas to block onward transmission. Use of the highly effective artemisinin-based therapies should be limited to the treatment of confirmed malaria infections, as there is no clinical evidence that these antimalarials can prevent or treat COVID-19. Routine malaria case management services must be sustained, in spite of COVID-19, to treat malaria effectively and support SA's malaria elimination efforts.

AB  - International Guidelines have voted for PCR as the Gold Standard in COVID diagnosis. Nasoparyngeal swab is the preferred specimen for PCR. It has a high probability of diagnosing early infection. But the diagnostic sensitivity of nasopharyngeal PCR decreases with increase in lapse between the infection and presentation to hospital. This might lead to dire consequences of labelling these patients as false negative, though such patients have been proved to be potentially infective since viral shedding occurs through other body fluids (stools) for long. COVID infection reveals that the IgM antibodies start to appear as early as 5th day of infection and switches over to IgA within 2-3 days. The aim of the study was to see if COVID antibody testing be coupled with PCR for diagnosis especially in patients presenting late (more than 14 days) of onset of infection? And if the antibodies are giving values, hence can them be reported quantitatively rather than in qualitative fashion? The second objective was to see if the COVID antibody levels be used to monitor the disease severity? And if the antibody levels of SARS CoV 2 be used an indicator to monitor the recovery?

To date, an in-depth review for these analogues as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and anti-hepatitis virus agents, which are at various stages of testing ranging from pre-clinical, to those withdrawn from trials, or those that are approved as drugs have not been documented. Hence, in this review, the importance of these analogues in tackling the HIV and hepatitis virus infections are discussed with a focus towards the viral genome, mechanism of action of these analogues, both in a mutually exclusive manner as well as their role in HIV/hepatitis coinfection. This review encompasses nucleoside and nucleotide analogues from 1987 onwards, starting with the first nucleoside analogue Zidovudine, to those in current clinical trials and even the drugs which have been withdrawn. This review also sheds light on the prospects of these nucleoside analogues in clinical trials as a treatment option for COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Medical solider readiness processing (SRP) needed to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a rapid practice improvement project to allow for a hybrid virtual medical SRP/in-person medical SRP to decrease exposure risk. A retrospective review comparing this virtual SRP to a historical in-person SRP cohort to the same combatant command was then performed. PROCEDURES: A virtual medical SRP was completed for 204 soldiers in preparation for deployment within 24 hours of receiving the deployment roster. Each soldier had their MEDPROS data sheet printed and reviewed for deficiencies. Soldiers were then divided into two groups. Group 1 required hybrid SRP with need for in-person labs or vaccinations. Group 2 had no deficiencies noted on MEDPROS review, and the entire medical SRP was done virtually. Pre-deployment health assessment (pre-DHA) was completed over the phone for both groups. The provider then determined whether the soldier was a GO or NO GO, and this information was passed to the unit's medical staff. Comparative data analysis was performed using t-tests assuming unequal variances and chi-square tests. INFORMATION FOUND: A total of 204 soldiers were expected to complete the virtual SRP process. Of those 204, 191 MEDPROS records were reviewed (93%). Seventy-seven of the 191 soldiers (40%) required level one labs and immunizations, had not completed their pre-DHA, or had a combination of these factors. One hundred and fourteen soldiers (60%) had these items completed and were given virtual appointments in GENESIS. One hundred and six of the 114 (95%) soldiers were able to complete their medical SRP virtually. Eighty-six soldiers (80%) of this cohort were a GO for deployment at the end of their virtual SRP visit.The novel virtual SRP process was comparable to the historic in-person SRP as evidenced by no statistically significant difference in terms of the number of providers required and the number of soldiers that was seen by any one provider. The groups did show statistically significant differences based on age, gender, and GOs/NO GOs. CONCLUSION: This is the first proof of concept of a virtual medical SRP on literature review. A virtual SRP process that combines a pre-visit record review with a virtual pre-DHA is a viable process for SRP. The ability to utilize providers outside of a confined location or post may allow for optimized utilization of this scarce resource and result in cost savings to the Army. The recreation of this virtual medical SRP within other Army installations may allow for the improvement and standardization of the medical SRP process as a whole.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine faculty's views about the move from face-to-face (F2F) instruction to online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The researcher used Q methodology [Q], a mixed method, to determine and describe faculty views about this situation. The participants sorted 36 statements to reveal and describe their subjective viewpoints. In Q, similar sorts are grouped together mathematically into factors, each representing a unique viewpoint. The Q-sorting process is reflective and self-referent. The operation of sorting items allows participants to provide their internal viewpoint. This is different from responding to a Likert-type survey. Additionally, the analyses allow for differentiation of views rather than an aggregate of views. Each unique viewpoint is described by a representative sort, distinguishing statements, and participants' post-sort responses. Three views emerged: Techies who like to teach (the view most positive in relation to teaching online); Overwhelmed as human beings (populated by caregivers); and It's about what cannot be done online (those who are focused on the limitations of technology and abilities for online instruction). Generally, faculty felt frustrated with their ability to best support their students within the online format. Administrators should consider the results of this study to better understand the instructional and mental-health needs of faculty especially in an emergency situation, such as COVID-19. The findings indicate that creating the best learning situations for students is not one-size-fits-all and that there are discipline and pedagogical issues to consider when moving F2F courses online that are not fixed simply with technology.

AB  - In this work, we evaluated the levels of genetic diversity in 38 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from five Central American countries (Belize, Guatemala, Cuba, Jamaica and Puerto Rico) with 04, 10, 2, 8 and 14 haplotypes, respectively, with an extension of up to 29,885 bp. All sequences were publicly available on the National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI) platform. Using specific methodologies for paired FST, AMOVA, mismatch, demographic-spatial expansion, molecular diversity and for the time of evolutionary divergence, it was possible to notice that only 79 sites remained conserved and that the high number of polymorphisms found helped to establish a clear pattern of genetic non-structuring, based on the time of divergence between the groups. The analyses also showed that significant evolutionary divergences within and between the five countries corroborate the fact that possible rapid and silent mutations are responsible for the increase in genetic variability of the Virus, a fact that would hinder the work with molecular targets for vaccines and medications in general.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for profit sectors.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging and highly infectious disease making global public health concern and socio-economic burden. It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed.

AB  - The current outbreak of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) or nCOVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus-2 (CoV-2), continues to wreak havoc globally. As novel vaccines are being discovered and developed, small molecule drugs still constitute a viable treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infections due to their advantages such as superior patient compliance for oral therapies, reduced manufacturing costs and ease of large scale distribution due to better stability and storage profiles. Discovering new drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infections is a time consuming and expensive proposition. In this regard, drug repurposing is an appealing approach which can provide rapid access to therapeutics with proven record of safety and efficacy. We investigated the drug repurposing potential of a library of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors which are currently marketed for type-2 diabetes as treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infections. These computational studies led to the identification of three marketed DPP4 inhibitors; gemigliptin, linagliptin and evogliptin as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro viral cysteine protease. In addition, our computational modeling shows that these drugs have the potential to inhibit other viral cysteine proteases from the beta coronavirus family, including the SAR-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV CLpro suggesting their potential to be repurposed as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.

AB  - Background: A major concern and challenge faced by the educational institution during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and consequent lockdown is the timely conduct of the summative assessment. Unlike cognitive assessment, real-time practical assessment through online mode, without compromising principles of assessment is difficult. This study was performed to analyze an alternative hybrid approach adopted for the postgraduate practical summative assessment in pathology. Materials and Methods: Evaluation of the process of summative assessment was done where internal and external examiners synchronously assessed examinees real-time on-site (face to face) and off-site (remotely through live videoconferencing) respectively. A pre-validated questionnaire on a novel approach for assessment and feedback (with close-ended on 5-point Likert scale and open-ended questions) were administered to nine participants comprising three final year postgraduates in pathology, four examiners (two internal and two externals) and two technical experts from the Department of Pathology. Overall scores obtained by all examinees were recorded. A pre-validated questionnaire and feedback were administered to the participants to assess the novel approach to assessment. Results: The mean performance score obtained by examinees was 63.5% in the summative assessment. Feedback analysis revealed that 85% of participants strongly agreed and the rest (15%) agreed that essential minor deviations introduced in this novel mode of assessment did not compromise basic principles and goals of assessment. Quality of assessment through this mode of assessment was graded as good to excellent. All participants responded that this mode of examination may be applied in the future under similar circumstances. Conclusion: This study concludes that an alternative novel hybrid method of real-time synchronous assessment with on-site and off-site examiners may be a feasible and successful model for conducting summative assessment and can be practiced in time of need.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a shocking reminder of how our world would look in the absence of vaccination. Fortunately, new technologies, the pace of understanding new and existing pathogens, and the increased knowledge of the immune system allow us today to develop vaccines at an unprecedented speed. Some of the vaccine technologies that are fast-tracked by the urgency of COVID-19 may also be the answer for other health priorities, such as antimicrobial resistance, chronic infections, and cancer, that the post-COVID-19 world will urgently need to face. This perspective analyzes the way COVID-19 is transforming vaccinology and the opportunities for vaccines to have an increasingly important role in health and well-being.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected about 210 countries with more than 67 million confirmed cases and over 1.5 million deaths across the globe including Pakistan. Considering the population density, health care capacity, existing poverty and environmental factors with more than 420,000 infected people and about 8300 plus mortalities, community transmission of the coronavirus happened rapidly in Pakistan. This paper analyses the short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 peak on the socio-economic and environmental aspects of Pakistan. According to the estimates, an economic loss of about 10%, i.e. 1.1 trillion PKR, will be observed in the FY 2021. Certain pandemic impediment measures like lockdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions taken by the Government have been thoroughly analysed to determine how they impacted the livelihoods of nearly 7.15 million workers. Consequently, a rise of 33.7% of poverty level is projected. While many negative impacts on primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy such as agriculture, education and health care are observed, a drastic improvement in air quality index of urban centres of the country has been recorded amid lockdowns. With current economic crisis, fragile health care system and critical health literacy, a well-managed and coordinated action plan is required from all segments of the society led by the public authorities. Thorough assessment of COVID-19 scenario, management and control measures presented in this study can be assistive for the provision of policy guidelines to governments and think tanks of countries with similar socio-economic and cultural structure.

AB  - The outbreak of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that has created huge trepidation worldwide, has a mortality rate of 0.5% to 1% and is growing incessantly. There are currently no therapies and/or vaccines that may help abate this viral disease, but the use of masks and social distancing can limit the spread. Boosting immunity has been a simple way to resist viral infection and limit fatalities. In this context, the use of nutraceuticals appears to be a potential panacea. The ability of algae-based nutraceuticals, mainly Spirulina, to boost immunity against viral diseases has already been reported clinically. Spirulina-based nutraceuticals boost the adaptive and innate immunity, and bioactive compounds, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor peptides, phycobiliproteins, sulfated polysaccharides, and calcium-Spirulan, can serve as antiviral agents. The presence of these molecules indicates its potential role in resisting infection and COVID-19 disease progression. This review focuses on the potential role of algal nutraceuticals as immune boosters to combat the human coronavirus and other viral diseases. The potential use of Spirulina-based nutraceuticals for combating COVID-19, its mechanism, and future directions have also been discussed.

AB  - In December 2019, Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China reported for the first time a cluster of patients infected with a novel coronavirus, since then there has been an outburst of this disease across the globe affecting millions of human inhabitants. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of beta coronavirus family which upon exposure caused a highly infectious disease called novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a probably bat originated disease was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the disease has affected nearly 56,261,952 laboratory confirmed human population and caused deaths of over 1,349,506 lives worldwide. Virus passes in majority through respiratory droplets and then enters lung epithelial cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and there it undergoes replication and targeting host cells causing severe pathogenesis. Majority of human population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 having fully functional immune system undergo asymptomatic infection while 5-10% are symptomatic and only 1-2% are critically affected and requires ventilation support. Older people or people with co-morbidities are severely affected by COVID-19. These categories of patients also display cytokine storm due to dysfunctional immune response which brutally destroys the affected organs and may lead to death in some. Real time PCR is still considered as standard method of diagnosis along with other serology, radiological and biochemical investigations. Till date, no specific validated medication is available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Thus, this review provides detailed knowledge about the different landscapes of disease incidence, etiopathogenesis, involvement of various organs, diagnostic criteria's and treatment guidelines followed for management of COVID-19 infection since its inception. In conclusion, extensive research to recognize novel pathways and their cross talk to combat this virus in precarious settings is our future positive hope.

AB  - The impact of restrictions during various phases of COVID-19 lockdown on daily mean PM2.5 concentration in five Indian megacities (New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad) was studied. The impact was studied for pre-lockdown (1st Mar-24th Mar 2020), lockdown (25th Mar-31st May 2020), and unlocking (1st Jun-31st Aug 2020) phases. The lockdown period comprises 4 lockdown phases with distinct measures, whereas the unlocking period had 3 phases. PM2.5 concentration reduced significantly in all megacities and met the national standards during the lockdown period. The maximum reduction in PM2.5 level was observed in Kolkata (62%), followed by Mumbai (49%), Chennai (34%), and New Delhi (26%) during the lockdown period. Comparatively, Hyderabad exhibited a smaller reduction in PM2.5 concentration, i.e., 10%. The average PM2.5 levels during the lockdown in the peak hour (i.e., 07:00-11:00 h) in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad decreased by 21.3%, 48.5%, 63.4%, 56.4%, and 23.8%, respectively, compared to those before lockdown period. During the unlocking period, except for Chennai, all megacities showed a reduction in average PM2.5 levels compared to concentrations in the lockdown period, but these reductions were mainly linked with monsoon rains in India. The current study provided an opportunity to study air pollution in the absence of major anthropogenic activities and during limited activities in monsoon season having an ecological design. The study reports a new baseline of PM2.5, except for monsoon, and explores this knowledge to plan future air pollution reduction strategies. The study also discusses how this new learning of knowledge could strengthen air pollution control policies for better air quality and sustainability.Graphical abstract.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 is a contagious disease and had caused havoc throughout the world by creating widespread mortality and morbidity. The unavailability of vaccines and proper antiviral drugs encourages the researchers to identify potential antiviral drugs to be used against the virus. The presence of RNA binding domain in the nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be a potential drug target, which serves multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle, especially the viral replication. Since vaccine development might take some time, the identification of a drug compound targeting viral replication might offer a solution for treatment. The study analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of N protein sequence divergence with other 49 coronavirus species and also identified the conserved regions according to protein families through conserved domain search. Good structural binding affinities of a few natural and/or synthetic phytocompounds or drugs against N protein were determined using the molecular docking approaches. The analyzed compounds presented the higher numbers of hydrogen bonds of selected chemicals supporting the drug-ability of these compounds. Among them, the established antiviral drug glycyrrhizic acid and the phytochemical theaflavin can be considered as possible drug compounds against target N protein of SARS-CoV-2 as they showed lower binding affinities. The findings of this study might lead to the development of a drug for the SARS-Cov-2 mediated disease and offer solution to treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a rapidly growing and evolving literature, there continues to be a vigorous public debate about whether the community use of face coverings can mitigate the spread of COVID-19 ten months into the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: This article describes a semi-structured literature review of the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of coronaviruses and similar respiratory pathogens, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). METHODS: : The author conducted a semi-structured literature review using search terms "COVID19" or "SARS-CoV-2" crossed with "mask/s" or "face covering/s." Articles were evaluated through October 30, 2020 for inclusion, as were key references cited within the primary references and other references identified through traditional and social media outlets. RESULTS: There is strong evidence to support the community use of face coverings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 from various laboratory, epidemiological, natural history, clinical, and economic studies, although there was only 1 high-quality published randomized controlled trial of this topic at the time of review. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in favor of community face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19 is strong. Although most of the benefit of wearing a face covering is conferred to the community and to bystanders, a face covering also can protect the wearer to some extent, both by reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection, and perhaps by reducing the severity of illness for those who contract a COVID-19 infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, a large number of COVID-19-related papers have been published. However, concerns about the risk of expedited science have been raised. We aimed at reviewing and categorizing COVID-19-related medical research and to critically appraise peer-reviewed original articles. METHODS: The data sources were Pubmed, Cochrane COVID-19 register study, arXiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv, from 01/11/2019 to 01/05/2020. Peer-reviewed and preprints publications related to COVID-19 were included, written in English or Chinese. No limitations were placed on study design. Reviewers screened and categorized studies according to i) publication type, ii) country of publication, and iii) topics covered. Original articles were critically appraised using validated quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Among the 11,452 publications identified, 10,516 met the inclusion criteria, among which 7468 (71.0%) were peer-reviewed articles. Among these, 4190 publications (56.1%) did not include any data or analytics (comprising expert opinion pieces). Overall, the most represented topics were infectious disease (n = 2326, 22.1%), epidemiology (n = 1802, 17.1%), and global health (n = 1602, 15.2%). The top five publishing countries were China (25.8%), United States (22.3%), United Kingdom (8.8%), Italy (8.1%) and India (3.4%). The dynamic of publication showed that the exponential growth of COVID-19 peer-reviewed articles was mainly driven by publications without original data (mean 261.5 articles ± 51.1 per week) as compared with original articles (mean of 69.3 ± 22.3 articles per week). Original articles including patient data accounted for 713 (9.5%) of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 576 original articles (80.8%) showed intermediate to high risk of bias. Last, except for simulation studies that mainly used large-scale open data, the median number of patients enrolled was of 102 (IQR = 37-337). CONCLUSIONS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of research is composed by publications without original data. Peer-reviewed original articles with data showed a high risk of bias and included a limited number of patients. Together, these findings underscore the urgent need to strike a balance between the velocity and quality of research, and to cautiously consider medical information and clinical applicability in a pressing, pandemic context.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death is commonly seen due to arrhythmias, which is a common cardiac manifestation seen in COVID-19 patients, especially those with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). Administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential treatment option during SARS-CoV-2, initially gained popularity, but later, its safe usage became questionable due to its cardiovascular safety, largely stemming from instances of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19. Moreover, in the setting of rheumatic diseases, in which patients are usually on HCQ for their primary disease, there is a need to scale the merits and demerits of HCQ usage for the treatment of COVID-19. In this narrative review, we aim to address the association between usage of HCQ and sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov and SCOPUS databases were used to review articles in English ranging from case reports, case series, letter to editors, systematic reviews, narrative reviews, observational studies and randomized control trials. HCQ is a potential cause of sudden cardiac death in COVID-19 patients. As opposed to the reduction in CVD with HCQ in treatment of systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatic diseases, safe usage of HCQ in COVID-19 patients is unclear; whereby, it is observed to result in QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes even in patients with no underlying cardiovascular comorbidity. This is occasionally associated with sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest; hence, its clinical efficacy needs further investigation by large-scale clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury is a condition that in many ways resembles classical acute kidney injury. The pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, and accordingly, our main objective was to review possible components of this form of acute kidney injury. DATA SOURCES: Literature review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our principal observation was that the various components of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury appear to be relatively similar to the classical forms. Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury cannot be approached in a "one-size-fits-all" manner. The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment. Although data from the literature regarding the previous coronavirus infections can give some insights, more studies are needed to explore the different mechanisms of acute kidney injury occurring as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.

AB  - A 34-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department for shortness of breath and chest pain. During a pandemic, it is easy to 'think horses and not zebras', and with a patient presenting with the classic coronavirus symptoms it would have been easy to jump to that as her diagnosis. After a careful history and examination, it became clear that there was another underlying diagnosis. Chest X-ray, echocardiogram and CT scan revealed marked right ventricular dilatation and pulmonary hypertension, alongside a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC). Further investigation with cardiac MRI and coronary angiography at a tertiary centre demonstrated that she not only have a PLSVC but also a partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage and sinus venosus atrial septal defect. This case highlights the importance of considering all differentials and approaching investigations in a logical manner.

AB  - The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell and spatial profiling have opened the way to complete the 150-year-old endeavor of identifying all cell types in the human body, by their distinctive molecular profiles, and to relate this information to other cellular descriptions, physiological phenotypes, molecular mechanisms and functions. Our effort to build a comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues is propelling the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, provides a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease, and suggests the possibility of predicting cell types and behaviors, towards a "periodic table of our cells". In this talk, I describe our foundational work underlying single cell genomics and the conceptual framework and impact of our understanding of cell and tissue biology in health, as well as how we use it to shed light on rare disease, cancer, and COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, was declared as a global pandemic by WHO more than five months ago, and we are still experiencing a state of global emergency. More than 74.30 million confirmed cases of the COVID-19 have been reported globally so far, with an average fatality rate of almost 3.0%. Seven different types of coronaviruses had been detected from humans; three of them have resulted in severe outbreaks, i.e., MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes suggests the possible occurrence of recombination between SARS-like-CoVs from pangolin and bat might have led to the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 outbreak. Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and harbour a genome (30 kb) consisting of two terminal untranslated regions and twelve putative functional open reading frames (ORFs), encoding for non-structural and structural proteins. There are sixteen putative non-structural proteins, including proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, other proteins involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2, and four structural proteins, including spike protein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a heavy viral load in the body, destroys the human lungs through cytokine storm, especially in elderly persons and people with immunosuppressed disorders. A number of drugs have been repurposed and employed, but still, no specific antiviral medicine has been approved by the FDA to treat this disease. This review provides a current status of the COVID-19, epidemiology, an overview of phylogeny, mode of action, diagnosis, and possible treatment methods and vaccines.

AB  - We address the impact of the tropical environment on the human nervous system using the multifaceted approach characteristic of environmental neurology. First, environmental factors are examined according to their nature (physical, chemical and biological) and in relation to human activity and behavior. Some factors are specific to the tropics (climate and infections), while others are non-specific (chemicals, human communities and their way of life). Second, we examine the major role of human adaptation to the success of Homo sapiens, with emphasis on the linkage between thermoregulation and sleep-wake regulation. Third, we examine the performance of environmental neurology as a clinical discipline in tropical climates, with focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by human African trypanosomiasis. Finally, the prevention, early detection and monitoring of environmental neurological diseases is examined, as well as links with political and economic factors. In conclusion, practitioners of environmental neurology seek a global, multidisciplinary and holistic approach to understanding, preventing and treating neurological disorders within their purview. Environmental neurology integrates an expanded One Health concept by linking health and wellness to the interaction of plants, animals, humans and the ecosystem. Recent epidemics and the current COVID-19 pandemic exemplify the need for worldwide action to protect human health and biodiversity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the mechanical ventilation rates of dental treatment rooms and assess the effectiveness of aerosol removal by mechanical ventilation and a portable air cleaner (PAC) with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. METHODS: Volumetric airflow were measured to assess air change rate per hour by ventilation (ACHvent). Equivalent ventilation provided by the PAC (ACHpac) was calculated based on its clean air delivery rate. Concentrations of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 μm aerosol particles were measured in 10 dental treatment rooms with various ventilation rates at baseline, after 5-min of incense burn, and after 30-min of observation with and without the PAC or ventilation system in operation. Velocities of aerosol removal were assessed by concentration decay constants for the 0.3 μm particles with ventilation alone (Kn) and with ventilation and PAC (Kn+pac), and by times needed to reach 95% and 100% removal of accumulated aerosol particles. RESULTS: ACHvent varied from 3 to 45. Kn and Kn+pac were correlated with ACHvent (r = 0.90) and combined ACHtotal (r = 0.81), respectively. Accumulated aerosol particles could not be removed by ventilation alone within 30-min in rooms with ACHvent<15. PAC reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal, and accumulated aerosols could be completely removed in 4 to 12-min by ventilation combined with PAC. Effectiveness of the PAC was especially prominent in rooms with poor ventilation. Added benefit of PAC in aerosol removal was inversely correlated with ACHvent. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol accumulation may occur in dental treatment rooms with poor ventilation. Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter significantly reduced aerosol accumulation and accelerated aerosol removal. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Addition of PAC with a HEPA filter improves aerosol removal in rooms with low ventilation rates.

AB  - Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is a flavin-dependent mitochondrial enzyme to catalyze the fourth step of the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine and to oxidize dihydroorotate to orotate. By selectively inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thereby inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis, the enzyme has been developed for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, bacterial or viral infections, parasitic diseases and so on. The development of inhibitory drugs requires a detailed understanding of the structural characteristics and catalytic cycle mechanism of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Therefore, this paper reviews these two aspects, and indicates perspectives of these inhibitors in clinical application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the outbreak of novel coronavirus, the treatment of respiratory diseases has been promoted. In particular, many traditional Chinese medicines, including Chinese patent medicines, have been found to be effective in the treatment of respiratory illness in China. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of most common respiratory condition. It is predicted that COPD will be become the third frequent cause of death by 2030. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). METHODS: According to the search strategy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule in the treatment of AECOPD were obtained from Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CNKI, VIP, CBM, and WANGFANG. Studies were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the study. Meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.4 software. Finally, the evidence level of the results will be evaluated. RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shufeng Jiedu Capsule in the treatment of AECOPD, and to provide basis for clinical rational drug use. CONCLUSION: Our research results of this study could provide reference for clinical decision-making and guiding development in the future COPD patient.

AB  - An immunoinformatics-based approach was used to identify potential multivalent subunit CTL vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Criteria for computational screening included antigen processing, antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. A total of 2604 epitopes were found to be strong binders to MHC class I molecules when analyzed using IEDB tools. Further testing for antigen processing yielded 826 peptides of which 451 were 9-mers that were analyzed for potential antigenicity. Antigenic properties were predicted for 102 of the 451 peptides. Further assessment for potential allergenicity and toxicity narrowed the number of candidate CTL epitopes to 50 peptide sequences, 45 of which were present in all strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were tested. The predicted CTL epitopes were then tested to eliminate those with MHC class II binding potential, a property that could induce hyperinflammatory responses mediated by TH2 cells in immunized hosts. Eighteen of the 50 epitopes did not show class II binding potential. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis on the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 for prediction of CTL epitopes lacking binding properties that could stimulate unwanted TH2 responses. Future studies will be needed to assess these epitopes as multivalent subunit vaccine candidates which stimulate protective CTL responses against SARS-COV-2.

AB  - The context of healthcare and of healthcare education has radically changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. To identify positive strategies for midwifery education in this context, five case studies from the UK and beyond were conducted using an appreciative enquiry approach, from the perspectives of students, the maternity services, cross-university collaboration, and digital learning. A health system analysis was used to identify strategies to cope, adapt, and transform for the future, at the levels of individuals, teams, and the whole system. Findings showed that the implementation of effective responses was possible. Responding effectively and rapidly to a shock as profound as this pandemic requires courageous, respectful, evidence-based, innovative, collaborative, cross-sectoral working and leadership across education institutions, practice settings, the regulator, government, and with students themselves. Pre-existing trusting relationships and collaborative systems supported rapid responses. Effective digital learning requires a pro-active, student-centred approach, and addressing the problems of inequitable access to equipment and space. Joint problem-solving and focussing on the key outcomes that matter contribute to developing successful strategies and robust processes. The pandemic provides an opportunity for student midwives to be re-imagined as essential members of midwifery teams and not 'just students'. Transformative actions identified include whole-system working, tackling longstanding problems including racism, poverty, prejudice, and systemic discrimination, and keeping students at the heart of the education system.

AB  - In-person interactions have traditionally been the gold standard for qualitative data collection. The COVID-19 pandemic required researchers to consider if remote data collection can meet research objectives, while retaining the same level of data quality and participant protections. We use four case studies from the Philippines, Zambia, India and Uganda to assess the challenges and opportunities of remote data collection during COVID-19. We present lessons learned that may inform practice in similar settings, as well as reflections for the field of qualitative inquiry in the post-COVID-19 era. Key challenges and strategies to overcome them included the need for adapted researcher training in the use of technologies and consent procedures, preparation for abbreviated interviews due to connectivity concerns, and the adoption of regular researcher debriefings. Participant outreach to allay suspicions ranged from communicating study information through multiple channels to highlighting associations with local institutions to boost credibility. Interviews were largely successful, and contained a meaningful level of depth, nuance and conviction that allowed teams to meet study objectives. Rapport still benefitted from conventional interviewer skills, including attentiveness and fluency with interview guides. While differently abled populations may encounter different barriers, the included case studies, which varied in geography and aims, all experienced more rapid recruitment and robust enrollment. Reduced in-person travel lowered interview costs and increased participation among groups who may not have otherwise attended. In our view, remote data collection is not a replacement for in-person endeavours, but a highly beneficial complement. It may increase accessibility and equity in participant contributions and lower costs, while maintaining rich data collection in multiple study target populations and settings.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has been identified to be a mutation hot spot, with the P323L mutation being commonly observed in viral genomes isolated from North America. RdRp forms a complex with non-structural proteins nsp7 and nsp8 to form the minimal replication/transcription machinery required for genome replication. As mutations in RdRp may affect formation of the RdRp-nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex, we analysed viral genomes to identify mutations in nsp7 and nsp8 protein sequences. Based on in silico analysis of predicted structures of the supercomplex comprising of native and mutated proteins, we demonstrate that specific mutations in nsp7 and nsp8 proteins may have a role in stabilization of the replication/transcription complex.

AB  - Primary and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) are hyperferritinaemic hyperinflammatory syndromes with a common terminal pathway triggered by different etiopathogenetic factors. HLH is characterised by a decreased capacity of interferon gamma production with an activated NK phenotype profile similar to other hyperinflammatory syndromes. Viruses are closely linked to the development of HLH as infectious triggers, and the break of tolerance to self-antigens is considered a critical mechanism involved in the development of immune-mediated conditions triggered by viral infections. Emerging studies in patients with COVID-19 are suggesting a key role of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of this viral infection, and there is a significant overlap between several features reported in severe COVID-19 and the features included in the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Therefore, SARS-Cov-2, as other respiratory viruses, may also be considered a potential etiological trigger of HLH. The frequency of HLH in adult patients with severe COVID-19 is lower than 5%, although this figure could be underestimated considering that most reported cases lacked information about some specific criteria (mainly the histopathological criteria and the measurement of NK cell function and sCD25 levels). Because HLH is a multi-organ syndrome, the diagnostic approach in a patient with severe COVID-19 in whom HLH is suspected must be carried out in a syndromic and holistic way, and not in the light of isolated clinical or laboratory features. In COVID-19 patients presenting with persistent high fever, progressive pancytopenia, and hepatosplenic involvement, together with the characteristic triad of laboratory abnormalities (hyperferritinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypofibrinogenaemia), the suspicion of HLH is high, and the diagnostic workup must be completed with specific immunological and histopathological studies.

AB  - The task of preserving patient data is becoming more sophisticated with the evolution of technology and its integration with the medical sector in the form of telemedicine and electronic health (e-health). Secured medical image transmission requires adequate techniques for protecting patient privacy. This study aims at encrypting Coronavirus (COVID-19) images of Computed Tomography (CT) chest scan into cipherimages for secure real-world data transmission of infected patients. Provably safe pseudo-random generators are used for the production of a "key-stream" to achieve high privacy of patient data. The Blum Blum Shub (BBS) generator is a powerful generator of pseudo-random bit-strings. In this article, a hashing version of BBS, namely Hash-BBS (HBBS) generator, is presented to exploit the benefits of a hash function to reinforce the integrity of extracted binary sequences for creating multiple key-streams. The NIST-test-suite has been used to analyze and verify the statistical properties of resulted key bit-strings of all tested operations. The obtained bit-strings showed good randomness properties; consequently, uniform distributed binary sequence was achieved over the key length. Based on the obtained key-streams, an encryption scheme of four COVID-19 CT-images is proposed and designed to attain a high grade of confidentiality and integrity in transmission of medical data. In addition, a comprehensive performance analysis was done using different evaluation metrics. The evaluation results of this study demonstrated that the proposed key-stream generator outperforms the other security methods of previous studies. Therefore, it can be successfully applied to satisfy security requirements of transmitting CT-images for COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is a common clinical problem that has occurred as a result of the concomitant use of multiple drugs. DDI may occur in patients under treatment with medications used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; i.e., chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, tocilizumab, and remdesivir) and increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as QT-prolongation, retinopathy, increased risk of infection, and hepatotoxicity. This review focuses on summarizing DDIs for candidate medications used for COVID-19 in order to minimize the adverse reactions.

AB  - The recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated serious respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), poses a major threat to global public health. Owing to the lack of vaccine and effective treatments, many countries have been overwhelmed with an exponential spread of the virus and surge in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Current standard diagnostic methods are inadequate for widespread testing as they suffer from prolonged turn-around times (>12 h) and mostly rely on high-biosafety-level laboratories and well-trained technicians. Point-of-care (POC) tests have the potential to vastly improve healthcare in several ways, ranging from enabling earlier detection and easier monitoring of disease to reaching remote populations. In recent years, the field of POC diagnostics has improved markedly with the advent of micro- and nanotechnologies. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, POC technologies have been rapidly innovated to address key limitations faced in existing standard diagnostic methods. This review summarizes and compares the latest available POC immunoassay, nucleic acid-based and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats- (CRISPR)-mediated tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection that we anticipate aiding healthcare facilities to control virus infection and prevent subsequent spread.

AB  - Mathematical models are key actors in policy and public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The projections from COVID-19 models travel beyond science into policy decisions and social life. Treating models as 'boundary objects', and focusing on media and public communications, we 'follow the numbers' to trace the social life of key projections from prominent mathematical models of COVID-19. Public deliberations and controversies about models and their projections are illuminating. These help trace how projections are 'made multiple' in their enactments as 'public troubles'. We need an approach to evidence-making for policy which is emergent and adaptive, and which treats science as an entangled effect of public concern made in social practices. We offer a rapid sociological response on the social life of science in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic to speculate on how evidence-making might be done differently going forwards.

AB  - The immunomodulatory effects of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy for cancer may act at the crossroads between the need to increase anti-viral immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and to decrease the inflammatory responses in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is evidence from preclinical models that blocking programmed death receptor 1 (PD1) protects against RNA virus infections, which suggests that patients with cancer receiving ICB may have lower rates of viral infection. However, given the heterogeneity of patient characteristics, this would be difficult to demonstrate using population-based registries or in clinical trials. Most studies of the impact of ICB therapy on the course of COVID-19 have centered in studying its potential detrimental impact on the course of the COVID-19 infection, in particular on the development of the most severe inflammatory complications. This is a logical concern as it is becoming clear that complications of COVID-19 such as severe respiratory distress syndrome are related to interferon signaling, which is the pathway that leads to expression of the PD1 ligand PD-L1. Therefore, PD1/PDL1 ICB could potentially increase inflammatory processes, worsening the disease course for patients. However, review of the current evidence does not support the notion that ICB therapy worsens complications from COVID-19, and we conclude that it supports the continued use of ICB therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic provided that we now collect data on the effects of such therapy on COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodological characteristics and good research practices of COVID-19 interventional studies developed in Brazil in the first months of the pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed the bulletin of the National Research Ethics Committee - Coronavirus Special Edition (Comissao Nacional de Etica em Pesquisa - CONEP-COVID) (May 28, 2020) and the databases of the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clinicos - ReBEC) to identify interventional studies registered in Brazil that assessed drug type, biological therapy, or vaccines. We described their methodological characteristics and calculated their power for different effect magnitudes. RESULTS: A total of 62 studies were included, 55 retrieved from the CONEP website, and 7 from registry databases. The most tested pharmacological interventions in these studies were: chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, sarilumab, eculizumab, vaccine, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, n-acetylcysteine, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Out of 22 protocols published on registry databases until May 2020, 18 (82%) were randomized clinical trials, and 13 (59%) had an appropriate control group. However, 9 (41%) of them were masked, and only 5 (24%) included patients diagnosed with a specific laboratory test (for example, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction - RT-PCR). Most of these studies had power > 80% only to identify large effect sizes. In the prospective follow-up, 60% of the studies available at CONEP until May 2020 had not been published on any registry platform (ICTRP/ReBEC/ClinicalTrials) by July 21, 2020. CONCLUSION: The interventions evaluated during the Brazilian research response reflect those of international initiatives, but with a different distribution and a large number of studies assessing hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine. Limitations in methodological design and sample planning represent challenges that could affect the research outreach.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic and the social distancing required to combat it have set in motion an experiment in psychoanalytic education of unprecedented scope. Following an abrupt shift from in-person study to remote classes, supervision, clinical work, and training analyses, the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research polled its psychotherapy and psychoanalysis trainees to assess their initial experience of remote training. Most candidates found the technical aspects of online learning easy and were satisfied with remote training overall. Across all programs, most trainees considered class length and reading load about right and felt their class participation was unaffected, though they found it harder to concentrate. Most found it no harder to start a training case, felt the shift to remote supervision had no negative effect, and were satisfied with seeing their training analyst remotely. Most trainees preferred in-person classes, clinical work, and training analyses to those offered remotely, yet in light of the health risks they said they were less likely to continue training in fall 2020 if in-person work resumed. Trainees suggested several modifications of teaching techniques to improve their participation and concentration in class. These findings' implications for the debate regarding remote training in psychoanalysis are explored.

AB  - Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices needed during the COVID-19 pandemic were widely reported in early 2020. In response, civic DIY volunteers explored how they could produce the required equipment. Members of communities such as hacker- and makerspaces employed their skills and tools to manufacture, for example, face shields and masks. The article discusses these civic innovation practices and their broader social implications by relating them to critical making theory. Methodologically, it is based on a digital ethnography approach, focusing on hacker and maker communities in the UK. Communities' DIY initiatives display characteristics of critical making and 'craftivism', as they assessed and counteracted politicised healthcare supply shortages. It is argued that their manufacturing activities during the COVID pandemic relate to UK austerity politics' effects on healthcare and government failure to ensure medical crisis supplies. Facilitated by open source design, communities' innovation enabled healthcare emergency equipment. At the same time, their DIY manufacturing raises practical as well as ethical issues concerning, among other things, efficacy and safety of use.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 resulted in widespread interruption of team sports training and competitions. Our aim was to review the recommendations and best practices in return to play in non-professional football after activity lockdown. The authors searched two electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science) to extract studies published before September 15 2020. Twenty studies explained recommendations, considerations, or best practices in return to play in football, and all of them were clustered into three groups: (1) training load management (n = 10), (2) medical recommendations (n = 9), and (3) recovery related issues (n = 5). The way to establish a progression in training process should be based on training load management and managing the number of stimuli per time. Following the studies, this training process should be divided into three phases: phase 1-physical distancing should be maintained; phases 2 and 3-group training should start. Medical considerations were clustered into different groups: general, pre- and post- training, during training, education, planning to return to competition, and suggestions for post confinement weeks. In particular, social issues, strict hygiene questions, and continuous PCR testing should be considered in return to play over football season. Finally, since a correlation has been found between high-intensive training loads and immunoglobulin A, nutritional and lifestyle recovery strategies should be performed. Moreover, since immunosuppression has been related to congested schedules (<72 h between matches), football federations should avoid this situation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore how to build and maintain the resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions. DESIGN: Scoping review supplemented with expert interviews to validate the findings. SETTING: Hospitals. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, bioRxiv and medRxiv systematically and grey literature for articles focusing on the impact of COVID-19-like working conditions on the physical and/or mental health of healthcare professionals in a hospital setting. Articles using an empirical design about determinants or causes of physical and/or mental health and about interventions, measures and policies to preserve physical and/or mental health were included. Four experts were interviewed to reflect on the results from the scoping review. RESULTS: In total, 4471 records were screened leading to an inclusion of 73 articles. Recommendations prior to the outbreak fostering resilience included optimal provision of education and training, resilience training and interventions to create a feeling of being prepared. Recommendations during the outbreak consisted of (1) enhancing resilience by proper provision of information, psychosocial support and treatment (eg, create enabling conditions such as forming a psychosocial support team), monitoring the health status of professionals and using various forms and content of psychosocial support (eg, encouraging peer support, sharing and celebrating successes), (2) tasks and responsibilities, in which attention should be paid to kind of tasks, task mix and responsibilities as well as the intensity and weight of these tasks and (3) work patterns and working conditions. Findings of the review were validated by experts. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations were developed on how to build and maintain resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions. These practical and easy to implement recommendations can be used by hospitals and other healthcare organisations to foster and preserve short-term and long-term physical and mental health and employability of their professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has been prescribed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. To assist in clinician decision-making, several clinical laboratories have developed and validated measurement procedures in-house based on HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS to measure the mass concentration of hydroxychloroquine in different biological fluids. In these cases, laboratories produce their calibration materials but rarely estimate the measurement uncertainty of their assigned values. Thus, we aimed to show how this uncertainty can be calculated, using the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibrators in blood-hemolysate-based matrix as an example. METHODS: A bottom-up approach was used to estimate the uncertainty related to the values assigned to end-user calibration materials prepared in-house. First, a specification of the measurand and a measurement equation were proposed. Then, different sources of uncertainty related to the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibration materials were identified and quantified. Afterwards, the combined uncertainty was calculated using the law for the propagation of uncertainty resulting in the final expanded uncertainty. RESULTS: In this study, the most significant source of uncertainty was that associated with the hydroxychloroquine's reference material mass obtained via balance, while the smallest contribution was from the uncertainty associated with the hydroxychloroquine reference material purity. CONCLUSIONS: A simple procedure to estimate the measurement uncertainty of values assigned to calibration materials is presented here, which would be easy to implement in clinical laboratories. Also, it could be put into practice for other pharmacological quantities measured by in-house HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS procedures commonly used in clinical laboratories.

AB  - This paper explores how some Italian HR managers narrate the changes imposed by the COVID-19 threat in the workplace. Events since December 2019 have presented exceptional circumstances to which HR managers have reacted in very different ways. This study explored how HR managers came to introduce organizational changes aimed at coping with the emergency, as well as how employees were involved in those organizational changes. The article is based on a thematic analysis of some interviews with Italian HR managers whose companies decided to switch working from home on a massive scale. We wanted to offer some reflections on the actions taken by a few HR managers and Italian companies to keep working at a time when most workers were forced to respect the lockdown.

AB  - Background To stop pandemics, such as COVID-19, infected individuals should be detected, treated if needed, and –to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals-isolated. Because most infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of COVID-19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested.Methods To evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated, which included: (i) county- and country-level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost-benefit related considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi).Findings Two temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low (∼ 1 %) and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited &gt;10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries. An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Geo-referenced, TP-based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost-effective than alternatives.Interpretations When TP is low and/or the T/C ratio is high, testing detects asymptomatic cases and the number of COVID-19 related deaths/mi is low. Geo-referenced TP data can support cost-effective, site-specific policies. TP promotes the prompt cessation of epidemics and fosters science-based testing policies.Funding NoneEvidence before this study To map this field, bibliographic searches were conducted in the Web of Science, which included the following results: (i) COVID-19 (95,133 hits), (ii) SARS COV-2 (33,680 hits), (iii) testing policy and COVID-19 (939 hits), (iv) testing policy and SARS COV-2 (340 hits), (v) testing policy and COVID-19 and asymptomatic (80 hits), (vi) testing policy and SARS COV-2 and asymptomatic (54 hits); (vii) test positivity and COVID-19 and validation (7 hits), and (viii) test positivity and SARS CoV-2 and validation (5 hits). Therefore, before this study, testing policy in relation to asymptomatic cases as well as test positivity represented a very low proportion (between ∼1 thousandth to ∼ 1 ten thousandth) of all publications. While many articles distinguished between diagnostic and screening tests, no paper was found in which testing policy is mentioned as part of a process ultimately designed to isolate all infected individuals. The few articles that mentioned test positivity only investigated symptomatic cases. These quanti/qualitative assessments led the authors to infer that neither testing policy nor test positivity had been adequately validated and/or investigated.Added value of this study We provide the first validation of test positivity as an estimate of disease prevalence under rapidly changing conditions: in pandemics, disease prevalence may vary markedly within short periods of time. We also address a double limitation of control campaigns against COVID-19, namely: it is unknown who and where to test. Asymptomatic cases are not likely to seek medical assistance: while they feel well, they silently spread this pandemic. Because they represent approximately half of all infected individuals, they are a large, moving, and invisible target. Where to find them is also unknown because (i) randomized testing is likely to fail and (ii) testing is very limited. Usually, the locations where infected people reside are not randomly distributed but geographically clustered, and, up to now less than four persons per thousand inhabitants are tested on a given day. However, by combining geo-referenced test positivity data with cost-benefit considerations, we generate approaches not only likely to induce high benefits without incr asing costs but also free of assumptions: we measure bio-geography as it is.Implications of all the available evidence The fact that asymptomatic cases were not tested in many countries may explain the exponential growth and much higher number of deaths observed in those countries. Ineffective testing (and, therefore, ineffective isolation) can also result from the absence of geo-referenced data analysis. Because the geographical location where people reside, work, study, or shop is not a random event, the analysis of small greographical areas is essential. Only when actual geographical relationships are observed, optimal (cost-benefit oriented) testing policies can be devised.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding was received from any agency in the commercial or non-profit sectors.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:We utilized publicly available data and no special permission was warranted.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Whenever the government makes medical resource allocation choices, there will be opportunity costs associated with those choices: some patients will have treatment and live longer, while a different group of patients will die prematurely. Because of this, we have to make sure that the benefits we get from investing in treatment A are large enough to justify the benefits forgone from not investing in the next best alternative, treatment B. There has been an increase in spending and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic that may have been warranted given the urgency of the situation. However, these actions do not bypass the opportunity cost principle although they can appear to in the short term, since spending increases cannot continue indefinitely and there are patient groups who lose out when resources are redirected to pandemic services. Therefore, policy-makers must consider who bears the cost of the displaced healthcare resources. Failure to do so runs a risk of reducing overall population health while disproportionally worsening health in socially disadvantaged groups. We give the example of ethnic minorities in England who already had the worst health and, due to structural injustices, were hardest hit by the pandemic and may stand to lose the most when services are reallocated to meet the resource demands of the crisis. How can we prevent this form of health inequity? Our proposal is forward-looking: we suggest that the government should invest our resources wisely while taking issues of equity into account-that is, introduce cost-equity analysis.

AB  - In critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a high incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events is reported. COVID-19 may lead to impairment of the coagulation cascade, with an imbalance in platelet function and the regulatory mechanisms of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Clinical manifestations vary from a rise in laboratory markers and subclinical microthrombi to thromboembolic events, bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. After an inflammatory trigger, the mechanism for activation of the coagulation cascade in COVID-19 is the tissue factor pathway, which causes endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated production of interleukins and platelet activation. The consequent massive infiltration of activated platelets may be responsible for inflammatory infiltrates in the endothelial space, as well as thrombocytopenia. The variety of clinical presentations of the coagulopathy confronts the clinician with the difficult questions of whether and how to provide optimal supportive care. In addition to coagulation tests, advanced laboratory tests such as protein C, protein S, antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitors, D-dimers, activated factor Xa, and quantification of specific coagulation factors can be useful, as can thromboelastography or thromboelastometry. Treatment should be tailored, focusing on the estimated risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The aim of this review is to explore the pathophysiology and clinical evidence of coagulation disorders in severe ARDS-related COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Understanding the lifestyle changes that authorities have requested or required in response to Covid-19 requires some biological knowledge. Therefore, articulations of intended biology learning at the school level will need to be evaluated, to see if they continue to be fit for purpose in light of the pandemic. This article proposes two principles of curriculum development and applies them to the (re)development of biology curricula in response to Covid-19. Firstly, while Covid-19 provides a vivid contextualisation of many biological concepts, it does not change the underlying concepts themselves. Moreover, it will not take long before it passes from being contemporary experience to a historical case study. Care is, therefore, needed to retain focus on the core concepts of biology, rather than allocating too much time to the particulars of the Covid-19 case. Secondly, biology curricula are often used to educate a population about public health. However, policymakers should be aware that knowledge alone is often insufficient to generate healthy behaviours.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA), the reason for its formation, the challenges with running the registry, and future opportunities for global collaborative research in rheumatology. RECENT FINDINGS: The GRA has been successful in collecting and publishing a large volume of case data on patients with rheumatic disease with COVID-19. In addition, the GRA has published reviews, opinion pieces, and patient-directed summaries of research to further assist in disseminating timely and accurate information about COVID-19 in rheumatic diseases. There have been numerous challenges in the journey but they have been addressed through a collaborative problem-solving approach. SUMMARY: The initial objectives of the GRA to describe the outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease who developed COVID-19 have been achieved. There has been extensive use of the data in the clinic and also to try and understand the mechanisms of disease and opportunities for drug repurposing. There remain numerous important areas for research which the GRA will continue to pursue as the pandemic evolves.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted household food purchasing and preparation, including elements identified as important drivers of household food waste. The two main aims of this study were (1) to examine changes in food waste behaviors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and Italy; and (2) to investigate potential predictors of food waste behavior, including avoidance of supermarkets, increased home cooking, and increased role of health concerns in food choices. A sample of n = 478 (79% female) individuals from the U.S., mean (SD) age = 30.51 (10.85), and n = 476 individuals from Italy, (78% female), mean (SD) age = 33.84 (12.86), completed an online survey between April 8th and April 28th 2020. Just under half of respondents (49%) reported decreased food waste since the start of the pandemic. Rates were significantly higher among the U.S. sample (61.5%, n = 294) compared to the Italian sample (38%, n = 180). Controlling for the time since restrictions were introduced, age, gender, and perceived financial security, logistic regression revealed greater reduction in food waste since the beginning of the pandemic for U.S. individuals relative to participants from Italy (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices. Further research should explore how these factors may be targeted to reduce food waste beyond the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic based on in vitro or early clinical findings. As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on ClinicalTrials.gov and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. RESULTS: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. Tabular results were available on ClinicalTrials.gov for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further 1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report results on ClinicalTrials.gov . Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.

AB  - As I entered the emergency room bay, her scared eyes shouted silently. An elderly female in obvious distress, she was non-verbal except for head nods. No family accompanied her. As a medical student, I felt clinically powerless, but I knew I wanted to assist however possible. As an extrovert, it was natural for me to think in terms of a human connection. I navigated through the crowded room, hearing conversations of suspected infection, and positioned myself at the bedside.

AB  - Several viruses of the corona family interact, via their spike (S) proteins, with human cellular receptors. Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virions, being structurally related but not identical, mediate attachment to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor in similar but non-identical ways. Molecular-level understanding of interactions between spike proteins and hACE2 can aid strategies for blocking attachment of SARS-CoV-1, a potentially reemerging health threat, to human cells. We have identified dominant molecular-level interactions, some attractive and some repulsive, between the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins (S-RBD) and hACE2. We performed fragment-based quantum-biochemical calculations which directly relate biomolecular structure to the hACE2...S-RBD interaction energy. Consistent with X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, the interaction energy between hACE2 and S-RBD ([Formula: see text]26 kcal/mol) corresponds to a net intermolecular attraction which is significantly enhanced by inclusion of dispersion van der Waals forces. Protein fragments at the hACE2...S-RBD interface, that dominate host-virus attraction, have been identified together with their constituent amino acid residues. Two hACE2 fragments which include residues (GLU37, ASP38, TYR41, GLN42) and (GLU329, LYS353, GLY354), respectively, as well as three S-RBD fragments which include residues (TYR436), (ARG426) and (THR487, GLY488, TYR491), respectively, have been identified as primary attractors at the hACE2...S-RBD interface.

AB  - Purpose: We describe the creation of computational models of lung pathologies indicative of COVID-19 disease. The models are intended for use in virtual clinical trials (VCT) for task-specific optimization of chest x-ray (CXR) imaging. Approach: Images of COVID-19 patients confirmed by computed tomography were used to segment areas of increased attenuation in the lungs, all compatible with ground glass opacities and consolidations. Using a modeling methodology, the segmented pathologies were converted to polygonal meshes and adapted to fit the lungs of a previously developed polygonal mesh thorax phantom. The models were then voxelized with a resolution of 0.5×0.5×0.5 mm3 and used as input in a simulation framework to generate radiographic images. Primary projections were generated via ray tracing while the Monte Carlo transport code was used for the scattered radiation. Realistic sharpness and noise characteristics were also simulated, followed by clinical image processing. Example images generated at 120 kVp were used for the validation of the models in a reader study. Additionally, images were uploaded to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software for the detection of COVID-19. Results: Nine models of COVID-19 associated pathologies were created, covering a range of disease severity. The realism of the models was confirmed by experienced radiologists and by dedicated AI software. Conclusions: A methodology has been developed for the rapid generation of realistic 3D models of a large range of COVID-19 pathologies. The modeling framework can be used as the basis for VCTs for testing detection and triaging of COVID-19 suspected cases.

AB  - Since February 18, 2020, the number of patients with COVID-19 has increased rapidly after the infection was initially confirmed in Daegu. Daegu city subsequently became the largest epicenter of the coronavirus outside China. In the early days of the outbreak of mass infection, Daegu citizens were in various difficult circumstances. Vascular surgery in Daegu was also affected as much as other medical field. Most of elective schedule were canceled, and the vascular surgeons cooperated to utilize the limited medical resources in Daegu region. Fortunately, the citizens of Daegu city could overcome the first crisis because of matured citizenship, sufficient medical resources and the timely-supplied surplus bed for patient isolation. Now all humanity today is interdependent and we are all one community in the pandemic. To overcome pandemic, it is necessary to respect and share experiences in various places at the beginning of the crisis.

AB  - The Coronavirus pandemic has presented society with major challenges that have required state intervention.. While government measures are necessary in an external crisis such as the current pandemic, negative effects can also arise from excessive government intervention, particularly for the economy. An analysis of the OECD countries shows that the state already played a major role in the economies of many countries before the coronavirus crisis, especially in Germany. However, state participation in companies does not necessarily have to lead to negative effects if it is structured appropriately. This article discusses how government measures, especially the extension of public ownership, should be designed in order to maintain competition and use the free market as an allocation instrument where possible. This means that no market structures should be created which could not have been created or which fail to comply with competition law. Moreover, state intervention should not be used to exert political influence on business decisions.

AB  - Targeting dementia prevention, first trials addressing multiple modifiable risk factors showed promising results in at-risk populations. In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60-77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score ≥ 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored ≥ 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired. The bandwidth of cognitive states bears the interesting potential for differential trial outcome analyses. However, trial conduction is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adjustments to the study protocol with yet unclear methodological consequences.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The conceptual framework of One Health (OH) provides a strategy for promoting collaboration across the nexus of animal, human, and environmental health, which is essential for tackling emerging disease threats, such as COVID-19. However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula. METHODS: In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students. DISCUSSION: Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.

AB  - Considerable efforts over the last decade have been placed on harnessing technology to improve access to behavioral health services. These efforts have exponentially risen since the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has prompted a move to novel systems of care, largely based on telehealth delivery. This article aims to provide a broad review of evidence for telehealth assessment and treatment of externalizing disorders and internalizing disorders in children and discuss practice considerations and established guidelines for telehealth delivery. Existing literature supports the promise of behavioral health interventions including behavioral parent training and combination approaches for externalizing disorders as well as cognitive-behavioral based interventions for internalizing disorders. There is a scarcity of work on assessment via telehealth compared with the available treatment literature. While treatment may be most pressing given the COVID-19 circumstances to continue delivery of care, movement toward establishing evidence-based assessment via telehealth will be of increased importance. Lastly, practice guidelines have been set forth by national associations, professional societies, and supported by the development of national Telehealth Centers of Excellence. These guidelines and practice considerations are discussed within the context of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Viruses on environmental surfaces, in saliva and other body fluids represent risk of contamination for general population and healthcare professionals. The development of vaccines and medicines is costly and time consuming. Thus, the development of novel materials and technologies to decrease viral availability, viability, infectivity, and to improve therapeutic outcomes can positively impact the prevention and treatment of viral diseases. METHODS: Herein, we discuss (a) interaction mechanisms between viruses and materials, (b) novel strategies to develop materials with antiviral properties and oral antiviral delivery systems, and (c) the potential of artificial intelligence to design and optimize preventive measures and therapeutic regimen. RESULTS: The mechanisms of viral adsorption on surfaces are well characterized but no major breakthrough has become clinically available. Materials with fine-tuned physical and chemical properties have the potential to compromise viral availability and stability. Emerging strategies using oral antiviral delivery systems and artificial intelligence can decrease infectivity and improve antiviral therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging viral infections are concerning due to risk of mortality, as well as psychological and economic impacts. Materials science emerges for the development of novel materials and technologies to diminish viral availability, infectivity, and to enable enhanced preventive and therapeutic strategies, for the safety and well-being of humankind.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a large disruption in the clinical education of medical students, particularly in-person clinical activities. To address the resulting challenges faced by students interested in emergency medicine (EM), we proposed and held a peer-led, online learning course for rising fourth-year medical students. METHODS: A total of 61 medical students participated in an eight-lecture EM course. Students were evaluated through pre- and post-course assessments designed to ascertain perceived comfort with learning objectives and overall course feedback. Pre- and post-lecture assignments were also used to increase student learning. RESULTS: Mean confidence improved in every learning objective after the course. Favored participation methods were three-person call-outs, polling, and using the "chat" function. Resident participation was valued for "real-life" examples and clinical pearls. CONCLUSION: This interactive model for online EM education can be an effective format for dissemination when in-person education may not be available.

AB  - AIM: Cancellation of university classes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic challenges teaching inperson sexual history-taking skills to medical, physician assistant, and nursing students. We used commercial online electronic services for medical students to learn sexual history-taking skills. METHODS: A total of 174 medical students viewed a lecture on sexual history taking and the PLISSIT model (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestion, Intensive Therapy) and were then randomized into dyads. They arranged a time to meet online on Zoom with their partner, chose a simple sexual history case-history (male or female) from a small selection, and recorded the 5- to 6-minute sexual history within a 1-week time frame. Each student played a "provider" or "patient" and then switched roles with a new case. One of the course tutors, all sexual health practitioners, downloaded 10 videos randomly assigned to them asynchronously and viewed and commented on the interaction of each "provider" along with comments on what to improve in the sexual history. 2 weeks later after the remainder of the lectures in the course, a second, more complex set of 8 cases were provided, so students could move at their comfort pace and choose 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Students were required to make 1 online post and 1 comment on another student's post for each case, on the experience, and associated issues arising, positive or negative. All comments were downloaded and analyzed by theme. RESULTS: Major themes included developing comfort in using sexual language, using simpler sexual terms suitable for patients, feeling confidence and mastery, excitement using technology developing clinical skills, surprise watching their performances and body language, observation of how they appeared to the "patient," organizing sexual histories and incorporating PLISSIT model, ability to ask about context and relationships, and seeing the exercise as building on existing clinical skills training. Some expressed anxiety and nervousness, which by the second case had largely or completely dissipated. CONCLUSION: A readily replicable, secure, cheap cloud-based model to integrate sexual history training asynchronously was provided, with tutors' comments, and student skills development, and performance evaluated.

AB  - This study investigates changes in pollution associated with the lockdown period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Galati (45.43° N, 28.03° E), a Romanian city located in the southeast of Romania. The study is focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a trace gas which can be related to emissions from industrial activities, heating, and transportation. The investigation is based on in situ observations from local Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) and mobile remote sensing observations by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. We also show results of the NO2 vertical column measured by TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), a space instrument onboard of satellite mission Sentinel-5P, to complement local ground-based measurements. For in situ observations, the lockdown interval (23 March 2020-15 May 2020) was separated from normal periods. The decrease in local NO2 concentration during lockdown, measured in situ, is rather small, of about 10-40% at the most, is observed only at some stations, and is better seen during workdays than during weekends. We conclude that the decrease in NO2 content over Galati city during lockdown is relatively small and may be attributed to the reduction in local traffic, a consequence of special measures and restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 lockdown by the Romanian authorities.

AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be significant and global. As the global community learns more about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is strong evidence that a significant modality of transmission is via the long-range airborne route, referred to here as aerosol transmission. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of ventilation, mask effective filtration efficiency, and the combined effect of the two on the reduction of aerosol infection probability for COVID-19 in a classroom setting. The Wells-Riley equation is used to predict the conditional probability of infection for three distinct airborne exposure scenarios: (1) an infectious instructor exposing susceptible students; (2) an infectious student exposing other susceptible students; and (3) an infectious student exposing a susceptible instructor. Field measurements were performed in a classroom using a polydisperse neutralized salt (NaCl) aerosol, generated in a size range consistent with human-generated SARS-CoV-2 containing bioaerosols, as a safe surrogate. Measurements included time-resolved and size-resolved NaCl aerosol concentration distributions and size-resolved effective filtration efficiency of different masks with and without mask fitters. The measurements were used to validate assumptions and inputs for the Wells-Riley model. Aerosol dynamics and distribution measurements confirmed that the majority of the classroom space is uniform in aerosol concentration within a factor of 2 or better for distances &gt; 2 m from the aerosol source. Mask effective filtration efficiency measurements show that most masks fit poorly with estimated leakage rates typically &gt; 50%, resulting in significantly reduced effective filtration efficiency. However, effective filtration efficiencies approaching the mask material filtration efficiency were achievable using simple mask fitters. Wells-Riley model results for the different scenarios suggest that ventilation of the classroom alone is not able to achieve infection probabilities less than 0.01 (1%) for air exchanges rates up to 10 1/h and an event duration of one hour. The use of moderate to high effective filtration efficiency masks by all individuals present, on the other hand, was able to significantly reduce infection probability and could achieve reductions in infection probability by 5x, 10x, or even &gt;100x dependent on the mask used and use of a mask fitter. This enables conditional infection probabilities &lt;0.001 (0.1%) or even &lt; 0.0001 (0.01%) to be reached with the use of masks and mask fitters alone. Finally, the results demonstrate that the reductions provided by ventilation and masks are synergistic and multiplicative. The results reinforce the use of properly donned masks to achieve reduced aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases transmitted via respiratory aerosol indoors and provide new motivation to further improve the effective filtration efficiency of common face coverings through improved design, and/or the use of mask fitters.

AB  - Pearson and Spearman correlations are important tools for all scientific fields and are widely used in medical sciences, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic emergency. This technical report has shown that conventional criteria for evaluating the adoption of these coefficients can conceal substantial scientific information regarding correlations that occur above or below a certain threshold. In particular, the Pearson coefficient can reveal hidden correlations even when data are not normally distributed. Finally, an optimized operational guide to reveal any hidden correlation is reported.

AB  - Background: Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities around the world have had to face a growing infodemic capable of causing serious damages to public health and economy. In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity. Objective: The aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected. Methods: RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1 - December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20 - May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling i the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution X_i=X(σ_i,x_i) was used to represent the trend of daily variations of x_ij=RSVs_ij. When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Student t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when t&lt;1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase Δ was used to quantify the difference between two values. Results: Google Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both period 1 and period 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets (Max |Δ| = +625% for Italian regions, and Max |Δ| = +175% for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities' RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference. Conclusions: In the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries' data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNone receivedAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:NoneAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Lockdown in India begins from 25 March and continues until 31 May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Due to such an extended period of lockdown for about more than 2 months resulted in 1.38 billion populations restricted themselves from mass activities that contribute to air pollution. Thus, through our quantitative approach and trend analysis, the study aims to evaluate the changes in the level of PM2.5 as a major pollutant for the top ten polluted cities in India, with a special emphasis on finding what happened to its concentration after the lockdown ended. Thus, to better understand the nature of variation in PM2.5, we divide the entire 7 months into three periods for our analysis, i.e., before lockdown (1 January to 24 March), during lockdown (25 March to 31 May), and post-lockdown or unlock 1 and 2 (1 June to 31 July). Our investigation reveals that before lockdown, all the top polluted cities of India violating the national standard of PM2.5, as the lockdown begins interestingly, all cities show a momentous reduction in PM2.5 concentration. Further, surprisingly we found that after the post-lockdown period, the concentration of PM2.5 was reduced to minimal, as the average concentration of PM2.5 for all the cities is below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The study reveals that the lockdown has a consequence in improving overall air quality for the top polluted cities in India and further lockdown in the future with proper planning should be considered an alternative approach to restrain excessive emissions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted resource constraints in respiratory support. The oxygen transfer characteristics of a specific hollow fiber membrane dialyser was investigated with a view to repurposing the device as a low-cost, readily available blood oxygenator. Oxygen transfer in a low-flux hollow fiber dialyser with a polysulfone membrane was studied by passing first water and then blood through the dialyser in countercurrent to high-purity oxygen. Oxygen transfer rates of about 15% of the nominal 250 ml (STP)/min of a typical adult oxygen consumption rate were achieved for blood flow rates of 500 ml/min. Using two such dialysis devices in parallel could provide up to 30% of the nominal oxygen consumption. Specific hollow fiber dialysis devices operating with suitable pumps in a veno-venous access configuration could provide a cost-effective and readily available supplementation of respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints.

AB  - Current recommendations for the management of patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) are largely based on evidence from resource-rich settings, mostly located in high-income countries. It is often unpractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings. We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with COVID-19 and AKI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure. For the diagnosis of AKI, we suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI. If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI. We suggest expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow. For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICS, we recommend judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation. For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice, where available and feasible. For patients requiring dialysis who do have ARDS, we suggest using hemodialysis, where available and feasible, to optimize fluid removal. We suggest using locally produced PD solutions when commercially produced solutions are unavailable or unaffordable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) have been affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the authors developed the 2020 International Web-Based Neurosurgery Congress (2020-IWBNC), which became the first successful virtual neurosurgical congress. The current article aims to describe this experience in designing and organizing a web-congress by the 2020-IWBNC method. METHODS: The 2020-IWBNC was organized by the Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery (CIEN in Spanish) in a record time of four weeks. Eight committees were created and assigned with a specific task to fulfill. The event followed a strict protocol based on the double-room method, which consisted of two virtual rooms (A and B) hosted from four different physical locations to avoid lecture overlapping and connection drops. Quality and impact were measured by videoconferencing platform and social media parameters, and an audience perception survey. RESULTS: High-quality was achieved in academic standards, worldwide assistance, schedule adherence, and security. The 2020-IWBNC hosted 25 internationally renowned speakers and offered 30 top-of-the-line multidisciplinary conferences. A total of 3,096 participants were reached from 125 countries and 22,266 live-stream views were registered. No technical or cybersecurity-related issues occurred. CONCLUSION: Web-based academic meetings will continue to be a helpful educational tool for CME and CDP. The 2020-IWBNC method (the double-room method) represents an alternative design that may be replicated by the academic community planning web-congresses and similar events.

AB  - Clinicians who care for patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) must wear a full suite of personal protective equipment, including an N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator, eye protection, a fluid-impermeable gown, and gloves. This combination of personal protective equipment may cause increased work of breathing, reduced field of vision, muffled speech, difficulty hearing, and heat stress. These effects are not caused by individual weakness; they are normal and expected reactions that any person will have when exposed to an unusual environment. The physiologic and psychologic challenges imposed by personal protective equipment may have multiple causes, but immediate countermeasures and long-term mitigation strategies can help to improve a clinician's ability to provide care. Ultimately, a systematic approach to the design and integration of personal protective equipment is needed to improve the safety of patients and clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel pandemic disease offered the opportunity to create new, disease-specific, symptom rubrics for the homeopathic repertory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to discover the relationship between specific symptoms and specific medicines, especially of symptoms occurring frequently in this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worldwide collection of data in all possible formats by various parties was coordinated by the Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis. As the data came in, more symptoms were assessed prospectively. Frequent analysis and feedback by electronic newsletters were used to improve the quality of the data. Likelihood ratios (LRs) of symptoms were calculated. An algorithm for combining symptom LRs was programmed and published in the form of an app. The app was tested against 18 well-described successful cases from Hong Kong. RESULTS: LRs of common symptoms such as 'Fatigue' and 'Headache' provided better differentiation between medicines than did existing repertory entries, which are based only on the narrow presence or absence of symptoms. A mini-repertory for COVID-19 symptoms was published and supported by a web-based algorithm. With a choice of 20 common symptoms, this algorithm produced the same outcome as a full homeopathic analysis based upon a larger number of symptoms, including some that are traditionally considered more specific to particular medicines. CONCLUSION: A repertory based on clinical data and LRs can differentiate between homeopathic medicines using a limited number of frequently occurring epidemic symptoms. A Bayesian computer algorithm to combine symptoms can complement a full homeopathic analysis of cases.

AB  - There is a vital need for authentic COVID-19 animal models to enable the pre-clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics. Here we report a dose titration study of SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model. After a high (5 × 106 pfu) and medium (5 × 104 pfu) dose of virus is delivered, intranasally, viral RNA shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is observed in 6/6 animals, however, only 1/6 ferrets show similar signs after low dose (5 × 102 pfu) challenge. Following sequential culls pathological signs of mild multifocal bronchopneumonia in approximately 5-15% of the lung is seen on day 3, in high and medium dosed groups. Ferrets re-challenged, after virus shedding ceased, are fully protected from acute lung pathology. The endpoints of URT viral RNA replication & distinct lung pathology are observed most consistently in the high dose group. This ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a mild clinical disease.

AB  - COVID-19 global pandemic has not ceased to spread worldwide since December 2019. Today, scientists and healthcare workers are urgently working to stop this viral invasion and protect the world community. Deciphering the specific cellular and molecular immune response to the new coronavirus 2019 is an essential step in order to develop effective treatment and vaccine. Recovery from COVID-19 infection was linked to appropriate immune responses. However, disease severity was correlated to impaired immune reactions. This review summarized the latest research findings on the role of immune system in fighting and also in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, it highlighted the immunological basis for the new coronavirus 2019 prevention, therapy and diagnosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: COVID 19 pandemic has brought crucial changes in the field of medical education. Ad mist university examinations in India medical schools have switched to online assessment methods to avoid student gatherings. In this context, we conducted online anatomy practical evaluation and we have aimed at quantifying the students' experience on virtual assessment. METHODS: A total of 250 first year MBBS students appeared for online anatomy practical examinations. Immediately after the completion of exams electronic feedback about their experience, in questionnaire format was obtained after getting informed consent. Their feedback was analysed and quantified. RESULTS: Completed feedback forms were submitted by 228 students. More than 50% of students favoured online anatomy spotter examinations. Only 32.8% of students were comfortable with soft parts discussion using images. For image based viva voce 61.4%, 80% & 82% of students responded that the features and orientation of osteology, radiology and embryology images, respectively, were good. For surface marking 55% of the participants preferred online verbal evaluation. Finally, more than 60% of the students preferred the conventional over online assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: The inclination of students' preference for traditional anatomy examination methods mandates adequate training of both students and teachers for virtual examination. The superiority of conventional anatomy practical examination methods is unbiased but pandemic situations warrant adequate preparedness. In the future the anatomy teaching and evaluation methodology in Indian medical schools have to be drastically reviewed in equivalence with global digitalization.

AB  - Type V and VI CRISPR enzymes are RNA-guided, DNA and RNA-targeting effectors that allow specific gene knockdown. Cas12 and Cas13 are CRISPR proteins that are efficient agents for diagnosis and combating single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. The programmability of these proteins paves the way for the detection and degradation of RNA viruses by targeting RNAs complementary to its CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Approximately two-thirds of viruses causing diseases contain ssRNA genomes. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has infected more than 88 million people worldwide with near 2 million deaths since December 2019. Thus, accurate and rapid diagnostic and therapeutic tools are essential for early detection and treatment of this widespread infectious disease. For us, the CRISPR based platforms seem to be a plausible new approach for an accurate detection and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we talk about Cas12 and Cas13 CRISPR systems and their applications in diagnosis and treatment of RNA virus mediated diseases. In continue, the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and its conventional diagnostics and antivirals will be discussed. Moreover, we highlight novel CRISPR based diagnostic platforms and therapies for COVID-19. We also discuss the challenges of diagnostic CRISPR based platforms as well as clarifying the proposed solution for high efficient selective in vivo delivery of CRISPR components into SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is currently a serious global issue. Epidemiological studies have identified air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and severity of illness, in addition to numerous factors such as pre-existing conditions, aging and smoking. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry. The study results suggest that examining these effects might help to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and aid the development of appropriate social interventions.

AB  - Over a remarkably short period of time, a great deal of knowledge about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection has been acquired, through the focused and cooperative effort of the international scientific community. Much has become known about how the immune response is coordinated to fight infection, and how it becomes dysregulated in severe disease. In this review, we take an in-depth look at the many immune features associated with the host response to SARS-CoV2, as well as those that appear to mark severe disease.

AB  - Momordica dioica have proven medicinal potential of antidiabetic, antiviral and immune stimulating properties. Flavonoids and triterpenoids from M. dioica were more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular docking and in silico ADME predictions methods. According to the binding affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The in vitro protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The in silico binding studies correlated with the in silico binding studies. Further, M. dioica being used as antidiabetic and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, M. dioica phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney disorders.

AB  - A new virus was identified in late December 2019 when China reported the first cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, and a global COVID-19 pandemic followed. The world was not late to respond, with a number of sweeping measures ranging from social distancing protocols, stringent hygienic practices, and nation-wide lockdowns, as well as COVID-19 testing campaigns in an attempt to prevent the transmission of the disease and contain the pandemic. Currently, different types of diagnostic testing have been adopted globally, such as nucleic acid detection tests, immunological tests and imaging approaches; however, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the "gold standard" for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pre-analytical factors, such as specimen selection and collection, are crucial for RT-PCR, and any suboptimal collection may contribute to false-negative results. Herein, we address some of the specimen types that have been used in molecular detection methods for COVID-19. However, the pandemic is still evolving, and information might change as more studies are conducted.

AB  - While dengue virus (DENV) infection imposes a serious challenge to the survival of humans worldwide, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remains the most devastating pandemic in human history. A significant number of studies have shown that plant-derived substances could serve as potential candidates for the development of safe and efficacious remedies for combating these diseases. Different scientific databases were used to source for literature on plants used against these infections. Thirty-five studies described the traditional use of 25 species from 20 families for treating DENV infection with Carica papaya and Euphorbia hirta were the most widely used across different regions. 13 in vivo studies, 32 in vitro studies, and eight clinical studies were conducted on 30 species from 25 families against different DENV serotypes, while plants from 13 families were reported to inhibit different forms of SARS-CoV, all of which were investigated through in vitro studies. Phytoconstituents belonging to various chemical classes were identified to show a wide range of antiviral activity against these infections. Extensive studies on the potentials of medicinal plants are needed to confirm their efficacy. This paper reveals the capabilities of medicinal plants and their phytochemicals in inhibiting DENV and SARS-CoV infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious disease outbreaks affect physical and mental health of humans worldwide. Studies showed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms increased in these conditions. This systematic-review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of PTSD related symptoms in coronavirus outbreaks. METHODS: Systematic search of literature was conducted in Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. Google Scholar and Grey literature including conference proceedings were also checked. Published articles from November 1, 2012 until May 18, 2020 were searched. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were also conducted to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: We found 38 articles with 19,428 individuals met the eligibility criteria. Of these papers, 35 studies were included in meta-analysis. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was estimated to be about 18% (95%CI: 15% to 20%). These symptoms were more frequent in cohort studies (29%) compared to cross-sectional (15%) and case-control (11%) studies. Prevalence rates of PTSD symptoms in MERS (36%) outbreaks were higher than SARS (18%) and COVID-19 (9%) outbreaks. Meta-regression showed that the geographical location of study was the source of heterogeneity (R2: 19.8%, P-value: 0.003). Meta-analysis reported that about three in every ten survivors of coronavirus infection, about two in every ten healthcare workers, and about one in every ten individuals of general population experienced PTSD symptoms in outbreaks. LIMITATIONS: PTSD cannot be objectively assessed and this can lead to information bias of included studies. CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms are shown to be common in coronavirus outbreaks. Mental care should be, therefore, considered in the present COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: Utility of vaccine campaigns to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not merely dependent on vaccine efficacy and safety. Vaccine acceptance among the general public and the healthcare workers, appears to have a decisive role for successful control of the pandemic. Aim: To provide an up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates worldwide. Methods: A systematic search of the peer-reviewed English survey literature indexed in PubMed was done on December 25, 2020. Results from 30 studies, met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis for final COVID-19 vaccine acceptance estimates. Results of an additional recent survey from Jordan and Kuwait was considered in this review as well. Results: Survey studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found from 33 different countries. Among adults representing the general public, the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China (91.3%). On the other hand, the lowest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%), Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%). Only eight surveys among healthcare workers (doctors, nurses) were found, with vaccine acceptance rates ranging from 27.7% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 78.1% in Israel. In a majority of survey studies among the general public (62%), the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination showed a level of ≥ 70%. Conclusions: Low rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were reported in the Middle East, Russia, Africa and several European countries. This could represent a major problem in the global efforts that aim to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. More studies are recommended to address the scope of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Such studies are particularly needed in the Middle East Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Middle and Latin America.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval is not applicable for this systematic review since data from previous published studies in which informed consent was obtained by primary investigators was analyzed.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - PURPOSE: Due to the recently emerging shortage in medical staff during the novel corona virus pandemic, several countries have rushed their undergraduate medical students into the emergency department. The accuracy of diagnosing critical findings on X-rays by senior medical students is not well assessed. In this study, we aim to assess the knowledge and accuracy of undergraduate final-year medical students in diagnosing life-threatening emergency conditions on chest x-ray. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional nationwide survey across all medical schools in Jordan. Through an electronic questionnaire, participants were sequentially shown a total of six abnormal X-rays and one normal. For each X-ray, participants were asked to choose the most likely diagnosis, and to grade the degree of self-confidence regarding the accuracy of their answer in a score from 0 (not confident) to 10 (very confident). RESULTS: We included a total of 530 participants. All participants answered at least six out of seven questions correctly, out of them, 139 (26.2%) participants answered all questions correctly. Pneumoperitoneum was the highest correct answer (93.8%), whereas flail chest was the least correctly answered case with only 310 (58.5%) correct answers. Regarding self-confidence for each question, 338 participants (63.8%) reported very high overall self-confidence level. Answers related to tension pneumothorax had the highest confidence level. CONCLUSION: Senior Jordanian medical students showed good knowledge with high confidence levels in diagnosing life-threatening conditions on chest x-rays, supporting their incorporation in the emergency department during pandemics and confirming the reliability of information they can extract.

AB  - The incidence of severe manifestations of COVID-19 increases with age with older patients showing the highest mortality, suggesting that molecular pathways underlying aging contribute to the severity of COVID-19. One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.

AB  - Covid-19 pandemic outbreak is the reason of the current world health crisis. The development of effective antiviral compounds and vaccines requires detailed descriptive studies of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein mediates virion binding to the human cells through its interaction with the ACE2 cell surface receptor and is one of the prime immunization targets. A functional virion is composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits created by furin cleavage of the spike protein at R682, a polybasic cleavage site that differs from the SARS-CoV spike protein of 2002. By analysis of the protein produced in HEK293 cells, we observe that the spike is O-glycosylated on a threonine (T678) near the furin cleavage site occupied by core-1 and core-2 structures. In addition, we have identified eight additional O-glycopeptides on the spike glycoprotein and confirmed that the spike protein is heavily N-glycosylated. Our recently developed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methodology allowed us to identify LacdiNAc structural motifs on all occupied N-glycopeptides and polyLacNAc structures on six glycopeptides of the spike protein. In conclusion, our study substantially expands the current knowledge of the spike protein's glycosylation and enables the investigation of the influence of O-glycosylation on its proteolytic activation.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the ongoing threat of pandemics caused by novel, previously unrecognized, or mutated pathogens with high transmissibility. Currently, vaccine development is too slow for vaccines to be used in the control of emerging pandemics. RNA-based vaccines might be suitable to meet this challenge. The use of an RNA-based delivery mechanism promises fast vaccine development, clinical approval, and production. The simplicity of in vitro transcription of mRNA suggests potential for fast, scalable, and low-cost manufacture. RNA vaccines are safe in theory and have shown acceptable tolerability in first clinical trials. Immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in phase 1 trials looks promising, however induction of cellular immunity needs to be confirmed and optimized. Further optimization of RNA vaccine modification and formulation to this end is needed, which may also enable single injection regimens to be achievable. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines, which show high immunogenicity at low doses, might help to improve potency while keeping manufacturing costs low and speed high. With theoretical properties of RNA vaccines looking promising, their clinical efficacy is the key remaining question with regard to their suitability for tackling emerging pandemics. This question might be answered by ongoing efficacy trials of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.

AB  - The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the dynamics of its spread is unprecedented. Therefore, the need for a vaccine against the virus is huge. Researchers worldwide are working around the clock to find a vaccine. Experts estimate that a fast-tracked vaccine development process could speed a successful candidate to market in approximately 12-18 months. The objective of this review was to describe the coronavirus vaccines candidates in development and the important considerations. The review was conducted through a thematic analysis of the literature on COVID-19 vaccines in development. It only included data until the end of June 2020, 6 months after the emergence of the COVID-19. Different approaches are currently used to develop COVID-19 vaccines from traditional live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit vaccines, to more novel technologies such as DNA or mRNA vaccines. The race is on to find both medicines and vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic. As with drugs, vaccine candidates go through pre-clinical testing first before they go through the three phases of clinical trials in humans. Of the over 130 vaccine candidates, 17 are in clinical trials while others are expected to move to clinical testing after the animal studies.

AB  - SARS-CoV2 infection not only causes abnormal severe pneumonia but also induces other relevant pathophysiological effects on several tissues and organs. In this regard, the clinical complications observed in COVID-19 include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary thromboembolism, myocarditis and, in the severe cases, the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Literature on COVID-19 highlighted the central role of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System in the determinism of SARS-CoV2 cellular internalization in the target tissues. Lung degeneration and respiratory distress appear to be dependent on the perturbance of physiological mechanisms, such as the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a dysregulation of the fibrinolytic coagulative cascade and the hyperactivation of immune effector cells. In this mini review, we address the physiology of Midkine, a growth factor able to bind heparin, and its pathophysiological potential role in COVID-19 determinism. Midkine increases in many inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and correlates with several dysfunctional immune-inflammatory responses that appear to show similarities with the pathophysiological elicited by SARS-CoV2. Midkine, together with its receptor, could facilitate the virus entry, fostering its accumulation and increasing its affinity with Ace2 receptor. We also focus on Netosis, a particular mechanism of pathogen clearance exerted by neutrophils, which under certain pathological condition becomes dysfunctional and can cause tissue damage. Moreover, we highlight the mechanism of autophagy that the new coronavirus could try to escape in order to replicate itself, as well as on pulmonary fibrosis induced by hypoxia and on the release of cytokines and mediators of inflammation, correlating the interplay between Midkine and SARS-CoV2.

AB  - During the COVID-19, healthcare workers are exposed to a higher risk of mental health problems, especially anxiety symptoms. The current work aims at contributing to an update of anxiety prevalence in this population by conducting a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline and Pubmed were searched for studies on the prevalence of anxiety in health care workers published from December 1, 2019 to September 15, 2020. In total, 71 studies were included in this study. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in healthcare workers was 25% (95% CI: 21%-29%), 27% in nurses (95% CI: 20%-34%), 17% in medical doctors (95% CI: 12%-22%) and 43% in frontline healthcare workers (95% CI: 25%-62%). Our results suggest that healthcare workers are experiencing significant levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those on the frontline and nurses. However, international longitudinal studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health, especially those working at the frontline.

AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were discovered in the 1960s and were originally thought to cause only mild upper respiratory tract diseases in immunocompetent hosts. This view changed since the beginning of this century, with the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, two zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates of approximately 10% and 35%, respectively. Despite the importance of these pathogens, no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections became available. However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was found to inhibit the replication of a wide range of human and animal coronaviruses in vitro and in preclinical studies. It is therefore not surprising that when the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in China, causing global health concern due to the virus strong human-to-human transmission ability, remdesivir was one of the first clinical candidates that received attention. After in vitro studies had shown its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a first patient was successfully treated with the drug in the USA, a number of trials on remdesivir were initiated. Several had encouraging results, particularly the ACTT-1 double blind, randomized, and placebo controlled trial that has shown shortening of the time to recovery in hospitalized patients treated with remdesivir. The results of other trials were instead negative. Here, we provide an overview of remdesivir discovery, molecular mechanism of action, and initial and current clinical studies on its efficacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to investigate the time of onset and duration of symptoms of loss of smell and taste in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: Two independent authors performed a systematic review of the Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, Lilacs and Web of Science electronic databases. The time of onset and duration of symptoms were considered primary outcomes. The sex and age of individuals, the geographical location of the study, the prevalence of symptoms, other associated symptoms, associated comorbidities, and the impact on quality of life and eating habits were considered secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Our search generated 17 articles. Many of the studies reported that the onset of anosmia and ageusia occurred 4 to 5 days after the manifestation of other symptoms of the infection and that these symptoms started to disappear after one week, with more significant improvements in the first two weeks. CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that the onset of symptoms of loss of smell and taste, associated with COVID-19, occurs 4 to 5 days after other symptoms, and that these symptoms last from 7 to 14 days. Findings, however, varied and there is therefore a need for further studies to clarify the occurrence of these symptoms. This would help to provide early diagnosis and reduce contagion by the virus.

AB  - Identifying and monitoring business and technological trends are crucial for innovation and competitiveness of businesses. Exponential growth of data across the world is invaluable for identifying emerging and evolving trends. On the other hand, the vast amount of data leads to information overload and can no longer be adequately processed without the use of automated methods of extraction, processing, and generation of knowledge. There is a growing need for information systems that would monitor and analyse data from heterogeneous and unstructured sources in order to enable timely and evidence-based decision-making. Recent advancements in computing and big data provide enormous opportunities for gathering evidence on future developments and emerging opportunities. The present study demonstrates the use of text-mining and semantic analysis of large amount of documents for investigating in business trends in mobile commerce (m-commerce). Particularly with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and resultant social isolation, m-commerce has become a large technology and business domain with ever growing market potentials. Thus, our study begins with a review of global challenges, opportunities and trends in the development of m-commerce in the world. Next, the study identifies critical technologies and instruments for the full utilization of the potentials in the sector by using the intelligent big data analytics system based on in-depth natural language processing utilizing text-mining, machine learning, science bibliometry and technology analysis. The results generated by the system can be used to produce a comprehensive and objective web of interconnected technologies, trends, drivers and barriers to give an overview of the whole landscape of m-commerce in one business intelligence (BI) data mart diagram.

AB  - Purpose of review: The pandemic COVID-19 has affected more than seventy million people globally. The whole world is eagerly waiting for an effective antiviral therapy to combat COVID-19, but it is yet to get. The emergence of COVID-19 makes imperative the need for safe and potent antiviral drugs. Many metal nanoparticles exhibit significant antiviral potential against many viral diseases. The Ayurvedic system of medicine is the treasure of many metal nanoparticulate drugs termed as Bhasma. Recent findings: Gold, silver, copper, zinc and iron oxide nanoparticles are effective against coronavirus. A possible mechanism of action of the metal nanoparticles against coronavirus is a disruption of outer layers of coronavirus. Swarna Bhasma, Rajata Bhasma, Tamra Bhasma and Yashada Bhasma are recommended for COVID-19 treatment due to the ability to reduce the plasma interleukins, interferons and TNFα levels. Summary: The Ayurvedic Bhasma preparations are unique metal nanoparticles. These metal nanoparticles are safe, stable in solid state and are having excellent biological activities. Ayurvedic metal nanoparticles, Swarna Bhasma, Rajata Bhasma, Tamra Bhasma and Yashada Bhasma could be proved as novel antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiviral and adjuvant activities.

AB  - This paper deals with one of the key problems of e-healthcare which is the security. Patients are worried about the confidentiality of their electronic medical record (EMR) which could be used to expose their identities. It is high time to revisit the confidentiality and security issues of the existing telehealth system. Intruders can perform sniffing, spoofing, or phishing operations effortlessly during the online exchange of the EMR using a digital platform. The EMR must be transmitted anonymously with a high degree of hardness of encryption by protecting the authentication, confidentiality, and integrity criteria of the patient. These requirements recommend the security of the current system to be improved. In this paper, a neural synchronization-guided concatenation of header and secret shares with the ability to transmit the EMR with an end-to-end security protocol has been proposed. This proposed methodology breaks down the EMR into the n number of secret shares and transmits to the n number of recipients. The original EMR can be reconstructed after the amalgamation of a minimum k (threshold) number of secret shares. The novelty of the technique is that one share should come from a specific recipient to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the EMR among such a predefined number of shares. In the absence of this privileged share, the original EMR cannot be reconstructed. This proposed technique has passed various parametric tests. The results are compared with existing benchmark techniques. The results of the proposed technique have shown robust and effective potential.

AB  - Objectives: The group of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) consists of some highly pathogenic viruses that have caused several outbreaks in the past. The newly emerged strain of HCoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the recent global pandemic that has already caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people due to the lack of effective therapeutic options. Methods: In this study, immunoinformatics methods were used to design epitope-based polyvalent vaccines which are expected to be effective against four different pathogenic strains of HCoV i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-SARS, HCoV-MERS, and SARS-CoV-2. Results: The constructed vaccines contained highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, conserved, and non-homologous T-cell and B-cell epitopes from all the four viral strains. Therefore, they should be able to provide strong protection against all these strains. Protein-protein docking was performed to predict the best vaccine construct. Later, the MD simulation and immune simulation of the best vaccine construct also predicted satisfactory results. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to develop a higher expression strategy of the vaccine. Conclusion: If satisfactory results are achieved in numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, then the vaccines designed in this study might be effective as preventative measures against the selected HCoV strains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been linked to over 40 million infections and 1.1 million deaths in 210 countries as of October 19, 2020. This highly contagious communicable disease has put not only infected individuals but other patients and frontline workers like nurses at risk in hospitals, especially in Intensive Care units (ICUs). There is a need for minimizing patient contact, improving hand hygiene practices, and optimizing healthcare provider time, especially nurses. Globally it is estimated that nearly a million health care providers have been infected with COVID-19 as of the end of October 2020. METHODS: This retrospective service evaluation documents the experience of health care providers in a COVID-19 ICU in India that was used to implement new protocols for secretion management and oral hygiene. Patient chart information and staff feedback were utilized. INTERVENTION: This pilot study captures the practical benefits of using VAPCare, an automated, closed-loop system for oral secretion removal. RESULTS: Six patients were included in this small-scale study; three patients following the current standard of care for suctioning and oral hygiene and three receiving the new VAPCare and Lumen device protocol. With the new device protocol, the number of infected secretion interactions by a nurse was 50% lower, and nursing time spent on oral hygiene and secretion management 70% less than seen with the current standard of care. The number of disposable gloves used with VAPCare and Lumen was reduced by over 50%. All 10 nurses and six doctors gave positive feedback on device usage. The department recommended updating protocols to prioritize the use of the new secretion management system for patients with COVID19 and other highly contagious conditions. CONCLUSION: The findings are an early indication that using VAPCare for patients could help protect infected patients, other ICU patients, and health care workers.

AB  - The strict nationwide lockdown imposed in India starting from 25th March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 disease reduced the mobility and interrupted several important anthropogenic emission sources thereby creating a temporary air quality improvement. This study conducts a multi-scale (national-regional-city), multi-species, and multi-platform analysis of air pollutants and meteorological data by synergizing surface and satellite observations. Our analysis suggests a significant reduction in surface measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (46-61 %) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (42-60 %) during the lockdown period that are also corroborated by the reduction in satellite observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) (3-56 %) and tropospheric NO2 column density (25-50 %) data over multiple cities. Other species, namely coarse particulate matter (PM10) (24-62 %), ozone (22-56 %) also showed a substantial reduction whereas carbon monoxide (16-46 %), exhibited a moderate decline. In contrast, sulfur dioxide (SO2) levels did not show any defined reduction trend but rather increased in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata. The temporary air quality improvement achieved by the painful natural experiment of this pandemic has helped demonstrate the importance of reducing emissions from other sectors along with transportation and industry to achieve the national air quality targets in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Google Trends (GT) is being used as an epidemiological tool to study coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by identifying keywords in search trends that are predictive for the COVID-19 epidemiological burden. However, many of the earlier GT-based studies include potential statistical fallacies by measuring the correlation between non-stationary time sequences without adjusting for multiple comparisons or the confounding of media coverage, leading to concerns about the increased risk of obtaining false-positive results. In this study, we aimed to apply statistically more favorable methods to validate the earlier GT-based COVID-19 study results. Methods: We extracted the relative GT search volume for keywords associated with COVID-19 symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight English-speaking countries and Japan. In addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with significant Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data. Results: Our Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately one-third) the number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal relationship with the COVID-19 trend when compared to those identified by the Pearson correlation-based approach. 'Sense of smell' and 'loss of smell' were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries; however, when adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not Granger-cause the COVID-19 positivity trends (in Japan). Conclusions: Our results suggest that some of the search keywords reported as candidate predictive measures in earlier GT-based COVID-19 studies may potentially be unreliable; therefore, caution is necessary when interpreting published GT-based study results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a need to prioritize care because of limitation of resources. Owing to the heterogeneity and high prevalence of breast cancers, the need to prioritize care in this vulnerable population is essential. While various medical societies have published recommendations to manage breast disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, most are focused on the Western world and do not necessarily address the challenges of a resource-limited setting. AIM: In this article, we describe our institutional approach for prioritizing care for patients presenting with breast disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The breast disease management guidelines were developed and approved with the expertise of the Multidisciplinary Breast Program Leadership Committee (BPLC) of the Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. These guidelines were inspired, adapted, and modified keeping in view the needs of our resource-limited healthcare system. These recommendations are also congruent with the ethical guidelines developed by the Center of Biomedical Ethics and Culture (CBEC) at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Karachi. Our institutional recommendations outline a framework to triage patients based on the urgency of care, scheduling conflicts, and tumor board recommendations, optimizing healthcare workers' schedules, operating room reallocation, and protocols. We also describe the "Virtual Blended Clinics", a resource-friendly means of conducting virtual clinics and a comprehensive plan for transitioning back into the post-COVID routine. CONCLUSION: Our institutional experience may be considered as a guide during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for triaging care in a resource-limited setting; however, these are not meant to be universally applicable, and individual cases must be tailored based on physicians' clinical judgment to provide the best quality care.

AB  - The distribution of cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 entry factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in human oral tissues were tested. The investigation was conducted with normal flesh tissue and paraffin-embedded specimens. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was detected with all subjects in the normal mucosa of the keratinized stratified squamous epithelia of the tongue and non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelia of the lip and cheek. It was found that ACE2 is expressed in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane mainly in the stratum granulosum of the epithelia while the TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed on the cell membrane mainly in the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum, but not in the stratum basale. Antibodies' reactions for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not observed in the nuclei or keratin layer. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the oral epithelia appears to be general, and the expression was also observed in the mucous and serous acini of the labial glands. The SARS-CoV-2 may transiently attach to the oral mucosa and the minor salivary glands which are present under all of the oral mucosa. The oral cavity can be considered an important organ for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and may provide a preventive medical avenue to guard against COVID-19 by preventing saliva from scattering.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Viruses cause many life threatening human diseases. Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health care systems worldwide. As a disease preventive approach and to bring relief to the severity of the symptoms, a infusion termed as Bhabha Anti-Viral Infusion-23 ('BhAVI-23') was conceptualized and formulated which comprised of 23 selected spices and herbals. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro antiviral potential of the formulation, BhaAVI-23. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in-vitro anti-viral potential of BhAVI-23 was assessed through inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as through a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriphage based screening assay system. Anti-diabetic potential was assessed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and the bioactive volatile components were detected through headspace gas chromatography followed by molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: The infusion displayed prominent anti-viral activity as evident from significant (57%) inhibition of the HIV1-RT as well as through reduction in the infectivity of P1 (virulent) bacteriophage. The infusion also exerted profound protection (∼64%) to non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin. Headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of at least 47 major compounds. Docking analysis indicated possible interaction of α-pinene and eugenol with SARS-CoV spike protein. CONCLUSION: This 'BhAVI-23' infusion displayed prominent in-vitro anti-viral and anti-diabetic potential in different model systems. These attributes have relevance as diabetic patients are more prone to COVID-19 morbidity. 'BhAVI-23' opens the avenue for its potential inclusion as a supportive health care system upon due regulatory approval during the current pandemic.

AB  - In this brief paper, I argue that the coronavirus pandemic is functioning like an ethnomethodological 'breaching experiment'. In short, it is putting a gigantic spanner in the works of neoliberal governance, in the process exposing the widening cracks and fissures of what I have called the 'fractured society'. I begin by recalling Garfinkel's notion of the breaching experiment and by listing the principal attributes of the fractured society. I then explore the response to the coronavirus in the UK, from the government's initial commitment to 'herd immunity' to its present policy of 'muddling through'. The bulk of the remainder of this contribution addresses precisely how this global health crisis shines a harsh and unforgiving searchlight on the strategies and policies pursued by governments in the UK since 2010, and most especially after the passing of the Health and Social Care Act of 2012. In the closing paragraphs, I examine possible scenarios for a post-fractured society, making particular use of Fraser's concepts on 'reactionary' versus 'progressive populism', and conclude with a comment on sociology and engagement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review practical, evidence-based strategies that may be implemented to promote teleworker safety, health, and well-being during and after the coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: The prevalence of telework has increased due to COVID-19. The upsurge brings with it challenges, including limited face-to-face interaction with colleagues and supervisors, reduced access to ergonomics information and resources, increased social isolation, and blurred role definitions, which may adversely affect teleworker safety, health, and well-being. METHOD: Evidence-based strategies for improving occupational safety, health, and well-being among teleworkers were synthesized in a narrative-based review to address common challenges associated with telework considering circumstances unique to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Interventions aimed at increasing worker motivation to engage in safe and healthy behaviors via enhanced safety leadership, managing role boundaries to reduce occupational safety and health risks, and redesigning work to strengthen interpersonal interactions, interdependence, as well as workers' initiation have been supported in the literature. APPLICATION: This review provides practical guidance for group-level supervisors, occupational safety and health managers, and organizational leaders responsible for promoting health and safety among employees despite challenges associated with an increase in telework.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for our healthcare system but at the same time is one of the excellent catalyzers and promoters of successful translational research. The COVID-19 is not only a simple viral infection of the bronchial system but is also a pandemic hyperinflammatory multiorgan disease. The cardiovascular system plays a causal role in this context, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), an enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity play an important role in the severity of the course of the disease. Additional risk factors, such as gender, age, genetics and air pollution modulate both the severity of the SARS-CoV‑2 infection as well as cardiovascular diseases. As sequelae of COVID-19, increased thrombosis, myocardial infarction, myocardial inflammation and vasculitis occur, which directly damage the cardiovascular system and substantially contribute to the high morbidity and mortality. Knowledge gained from many studies on the course of the disease in patients infected with SARS-CoV‑2 has led to improved treatment possibilities, which now in the second wave are partly standardized and were, and are, in particular adapted to complications of the cardiovascular system. In this review we provide a short overview on the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV‑2 in general and also specifically on the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, we summarize the current treatment approaches and their pathophysiological principles (status November 2020).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, provides evidence-based support as a supplement to provider-facilitated prenatal care, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a conceptual content analysis approach, a query of 40 questions, relating to all phases of pregnancy, was collected from Alexa by two independent investigators, using two unique devices, over a one-week period between May 20, 2020 and May 27, 2020. Alexa's responses were matched to the evidence-based content from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and reviewed by a Certified Nurse Midwife for completeness and currency. RESULTS: Of the 40 questions asked of Alexa, it was unable to answer 14 questions (35%). A total of 21 out of the 40 responses (52%) were not evidence-based and three COVID-specific questions (about 1%) were answered incorrectly or insufficiently. Four questions (10%) were answered accurately. CONCLUSION: Alexa was largely unable to provide evidence-based answers to commonly asked pregnancy questions and, in many cases, supplied inaccurate, incomplete, or completely unrelated answers that could further confuse health consumers. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Ensuring that mobile health (mhealth) tools, such as Amazon Alexa, are evidence-based and credible in answering common prenatal questions has important implications for this pandemic and future consumer needs.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main type of liver cancer. In the majority of cases, HCC is diagnosed at the advanced stage, leading to poor prognosis. In recent years, many efforts have been devoted to investigating potential new and more effective drugs and, indeed, the treatment armamentarium for advanced HCC has broadened tremendously, with targeted- and immune-therapies, and probably the combination of both, playing pivotal roles. Together with new established knowledge, many issues are emerging, with the role of neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings, the definition of the best transitioning time from loco-regional treatments to systemic therapy, the identification of potential predictive biomarkers, and radiomics being just some of the topics that will have to be further explored in the next future. Clearly, the current COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the management of HCC patients and some considerations about this topic will be elucidated.

AB  - Effective states govern by some combination of enforcement and voluntary compliance. To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens' support for anti-COVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcement-termed control aversion-vary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some anti-COVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for policies to address future pandemics and other societal challenges like climate change.

AB  - Withholding or withdrawing life-saving ventilators can become necessary when resources are insufficient. In the USA, such rationing has unique social justice dimensions. Structural elements of dominant allocation frameworks simultaneously advantage white communities, and disadvantage Black communities-who already experience a disproportionate burden of COVID-19-related job losses, hospitalisations and mortality. Using the example of New Jersey's Crisis Standard of Care policy, we describe how dominant rationing guidance compounds for many Black patients prior unfair structural disadvantage, chiefly due to the way creatinine and life expectancy are typically considered.We outline six possible policy options towards a more just approach: improving diversity in decision processes, adjusting creatinine scores, replacing creatinine, dropping creatinine, finding alternative measures, adding equity weights and rejecting the dominant model altogether. We also contrast these options with making no changes, which is not a neutral default, but in separate need of justification, despite a prominent claim that it is simply based on 'objective medical knowledge'. In the regrettable absence of fair federal guidance, hospital and state-level policymakers should reflect on which of these, or further options, seem feasible and justifiable.Irrespective of which approach is taken, all guidance should be supplemented with a monitoring and reporting requirement on possible disparate impacts. The hope that we will be able to continue to avoid rationing ventilators must not stand in the way of revising guidance in a way that better promotes health equity and racial justice, both to be prepared, and given the significant expressive value of ventilator guidance.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the betacoronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has only recently emerged, while Mycobacterium leprae, the etiological agent of leprosy, has endured for more than 2,000 years. As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. leprae-SARS-CoV-2 coinfection have yet to be fully investigated. The goal of the present viewpoint is to describe some of the similarities that may be found between COVID-19 and leprosy disease in the context of neutrophilic biology.

AB  - Objective: To determine the correlation between 3 lightweight portable pulse oximeter devices compared to a standard wall mount pulse oximetry device. Methods: We performed a single-center, prospective, observational study of 4 pulse oximetry devices, 3 of which are commercially available to the public. A convenience sample of 200 emergency department (ED) patients with chief complaints of cardiopulmonary origin or a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 94 percent were enrolled. Analysis of variance was performed to compare SpO2s and test characteristics of the 3 devices compared to control. Results: Although differences in measured SpO2s were observed (P < 0.001) across groups, the differences were small (mean differences ranged from 1.00% to 1.87%). The correlation between test devices and the control were high (r range 0.70-0.79). Although the test characteristics were not perfect, the devices did have good sensitivity using a cutoff value of 94% (sensitivity ranging from 90% to 92%), which improved with lower SpO2 cutoff values to 92% (sensitivity ranging from 96% to 97%). Conclusion: The 3 commercially available devices were accurate enough to be clinically useful when compared to a hospital bedside monitor pulse oximeter. Consumer-grade portable pulse oximeters may be useful if overwhelming numbers of patients require oxygen saturation monitoring, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Sports ultrasound (US) is a rapidly advancing and expanding field, where "hands-on" education and real-time instructor feedback are paramount in developing this skill. In light of a global pandemic and limited access to instructors and educational conferences, sports US education must adapt to continue to teach future ultrasonographers. Virtual US education, conducted using various virtual meeting platforms not only allows for continued didactic education but also can virtually recreate the "hands-on" training sessions with live, immediate instructor feedback that is necessary for acquiring competence. Additionally, using these methods, sports US conferences can continue in a virtual manner, sports US education can expand remote areas, and collaboration among distant experts may increase, all without the cost of travel and extended time away from work. While immediately relevant because of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual US methods may continue to be beneficial as sports US education and collaboration continue to expand.

The semFYC PAPPS program biannually publishes the recommendations of the group and, in this edition, special emphasis is placed on the common vaccination proposed by the Ministry of Health, where, at last, it no longer discriminates between paediatrics and adults, and proposes a calendar throughout life. The main novelties in the field of vaccinology today are focused on the consolidation of the nonavalent vaccine against the human papilloma virus and in the change of the dose of monovalent meningitis vaccine C for the tetravalent one, ACWY, at age 12. The pandemic we are experiencing has led to the postponement of most preventive activities. On the return to «normality», the vaccination calendar must be examined, and completed if necessary.

AB  - Patients with COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Co-V)-2 demonstrate high rates of co-infection with respiratory viruses, including influenza A (IAV), suggesting pathogenic interactions. We investigated how IAV may increase the risk for COVID-19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate to uptake SARS-CoV-2 intracellular. We found, using single cell RNA sequencing of distal human non-diseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated, and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways. We focused on human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections. Primary SAEC from non-diseased donor lungs apically infected (at air-liquid interface) with IAV (up to 3×105 pfu; ∼1 MOI) markedly (8-fold) boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses. IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intrac¬ellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment (90 kDa) in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor. IAV also increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 (TACE) and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation. These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the distal lung. Further, posttranslational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase the vulnerability to lung injury such as ARDS during viral co-infections. These findings support prevention and treatment efforts of influenza infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Repurposing FDA-approved drugs that treat respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, could quickly provide much needed antiviral therapies. In the current study, the potency and cellular toxicity of four fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) were assessed in Vero cells and A549 cells engineered to overexpress ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor. All four fluoroquinolones suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication at high micromolar concentrations in both cell types, with enoxacin demonstrating the lowest effective concentration 50 value (EC50) of 126.4 μM in Vero cells. Enoxacin also suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV-2 in Vero cells at high micromolar concentrations. Cellular toxicity of levofloxacin was not found in either cell type. In Vero cells, minimal toxicity was observed following treatment with ≥37.5 μM enoxacin and 600 μM ciprofloxacin. Toxicity in both cell types was detected after moxifloxacin treatment of ≥300 μM. In summary, these results suggest that the ability of fluoroquinolones to suppress SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication in cultured cells is limited.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led policy makers to expand traditional public health surveillance to take advantage of new technologies, such as tracking apps, to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This article explores the human rights dimensions of how these new surveillance technologies are being used and assesses the extent to which they entail legitimate restrictions to a range of human rights, including the rights to health, life, and privacy. We argue that human rights offer a crucial framework for protecting the public from regulatory overreach by ensuring that digital health surveillance does not undermine fundamental features of democratic society. First, we describe the surveillance technologies being used to address COVID-19 and reposition these technologies within the evolution of public health surveillance tools and the emergence of discussions concerning the compatibility of such tools with human rights. We then evaluate the potential human rights implications of the surveillance tools being used today by analyzing the extent to which they pass the tests of necessity and proportionality enshrined in international human rights law. We conclude by recommending ways in which the harmful human rights effects associated with these technologies might be reduced and public trust in their use enhanced.

The package facilitates the search of the Rfam database by keywords or sequences, as well as the retrieval of all available information about specific Rfam families, such as member sequences, multiple sequence alignments, secondary structures and covariance models. By providing such programmatic access to the Rfam database, rfaRm enables genomic workflows to incorporate information about non-coding RNA, whose potential cannot be fully exploited just through interactive access to the database. The features of rfaRm are demonstrated by using it to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genome as an example case.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which resulted from the pandemic outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a massive inflammatory cytokine storm leading to multi-organ damage including that of the brain and testes. While the lungs, heart, and brain are identified as the main targets of SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathogenesis, reports on its testicular infections have been a subject of debate. The brain and testes are physiologically synchronized by the action of gonadotropins and sex steroid hormones. Though the evidence for the presence of the viral particles in the testicular biopsies and semen samples from COVID-19 patients are highly limited, the occurrence of testicular pathology due to abrupt inflammatory responses and hyperthermia has incresingly been evident. The reduced level of testosterone production in COVID-19 is associated with altered secretion of gonadotropins. Moreover, hypothalamic pathology which results from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brain is also evident in COVID-19 cases. This article revisits and supports the key reports on testicular abnormalities and pathological signatures in the hypothalamus of COVID-19 patients and emphasizes that testicular pathology resulting from inflammation and oxidative stress might lead to infertility in a significant portion of COVID-19 survivors. Further investigations are required to monitor the reproductive health parameters and HPG axis abnormalities related to secondary pathological complications in COVID-19 patients and survivors.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic brought about a sudden disruption to the way medical services are rendered in our country. Management of maxillofacial injuries, especially isolated mandibular fractures by surgical methods, became near impossibility because of the restrictions and other concerns related to the pandemic. Methods: The individuals who suffered isolated mandibular fracture because of trauma were included, to undergo conservative treatment methods with adaptations for the pandemic. Individuals with multiple bone fractures were excluded, and the selected patients were given the choice to opt out from this treatment plan. We followed a more conservative approach with adaptations, which we have discussed in this article. Result: The fracture healing for all the patients was as expected, and none of our team members got infected with this virus from exposure to patients. Conclusion: The adaptations helped in limiting the possible exposure of patients, relatives and health care providers to the virus and addressed other pressing concerns related to this pandemic. We present the guideline that we formulated in our unit, which we used to manage the patients who reported to us with isolated mandibular fractures during the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most significant public health threats in recent history and has impacted the lives of almost everyone worldwide. Epigenetic mechanisms contribute to many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, including expression levels of viral receptor ACE2, expression of cytokine genes as part of the host immune response, and the implication of various histone modifications in several aspects of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 proteins physically associate with many different host proteins over the course of infection, and notably there are several interactions between viral proteins and epigenetic enzymes such as HDACs and bromodomain-containing proteins as shown by correlation-based studies. The many contributions of epigenetic mechanisms to the viral life cycle and the host immune response to infection have resulted in epigenetic factors being identified as emerging biomarkers for COVID-19, and project epigenetic modifiers as promising therapeutic targets to combat COVID-19. This review article highlights the major epigenetic pathways at play during COVID-19 disease and discusses ongoing clinical trials that will hopefully contribute to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly affected the lives of many people across North Carolina and the United States. Similar to the rest of the country, the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the state indicates health disparities among Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals, the presence of hotspots, or counties with high numbers of infected persons, and clusters of transmission among congregate living facilities. There have been many advances in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 and therapies for hospitalized patients nationwide. Public health strategies have included widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2, optimal management of cases, contact tracing efforts, and a phased reopening of sectors/activities in North Carolina with masks and physical distancing to minimize spread of the virus. In this issue, several authors, researchers, and public health leaders discuss the challenges that North Carolinians have experienced with respect to COVID-19 and several factors that are likely contributing to the health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities who have had the highest number of cases and deaths from SARS-CoV-2. Additional strategies also reported in this issue include the use of strike teams and mobile units to reach populations at high risk for infection and severe illness. Promoting individual and population-level strategies for minimizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially among the most vulnerable, and consistent public health messaging based on science are critical as we face the new year and continued uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Men show higher vulnerability to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) and present with depleted testosterone levels. Reports pertaining to high luteinizing hormone (LH), while diminished levels of in COVID-19 patients negate the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis mediated lowering of testosterone. Although not evidenced, high testicular expression of angiotensin-converting enzymes-2 (ACE2), that aids viral entry into cells, may suggest direct viral-testicular invasion. However, secondary inflammation and oxidative stress (OS), owing to SARS-CoV-2 infection, are more likely to impair steroidogenesis. Moreover, blockage of ACE2 aided angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7) conversion may also affect testosterone synthesis. SARS-CoV-2, by mimicking adrenocorticotrophic (ACTH) hormones, may trigger host antibodies against the ACTH molecules to suppress host stress response. This commentary concisely presents the possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect testosterone levels, which possibly result in compromised male reproductive health.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a major role in addressing novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)-related issues and is also used in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). AI, including machine learning, is used by artificial neural networks such as deep neural networks and recurrent networks. AI has been used in activity predictions like physicochemical properties. Machine learning in de novo design explores the generation of fruitful, biologically active molecules toward expected or finished products. Several examples establish the strength of machine learning or AI in this field. AI techniques can significantly improve treatment consistency and decision making by developing useful algorithms. AI is helpful not only in the treatment of COVID-19-infected patients but also for their proper health monitoring. It can track the crisis of COVID-19 at different scales, such as medical, molecular, and epidemiological applications. It is also helpful to facilitate the research on this virus by analyzing the available data. AI can help in developing proper treatment regimens, prevention strategies, and drug and vaccine development. Combination with synthesis planning and ease of synthesis are feasible, and more and more automated drug discovery by computers is expected in the near future to eradicate the COVID-19 virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To combat social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19, Canadian communities began a Facebook social media movement, #Caremongering, to support vulnerable individuals in their communities. Little research has examined the spread and use of #Caremongering to address community health and social needs. OBJECTIVES: We examined the rate at which #Caremongering grew across Canada, the main ways the groups were used, and differences in use by membership size and activity. METHODS: We searched Facebook Groups using the term "Caremongering" combined with the names of the largest population centres in every province and territory in Canada. We extracted available Facebook analytics on all the groups found, restricted to public groups that operated in English. We further conducted a content analysis of themes from postings in 30 groups using purposive sampling. Posted content was qualitatively analyzed to determine consistent themes across the groups and between those with smaller and larger member numbers. RESULTS: The search of Facebook groups across 185 cities yielded 130 unique groups, including groups from all 13 provinces and territories in Canada. Total membership across all groups as of May 4, 2020 was 194,879. The vast majority were formed within days of the global pandemic announcement, two months prior. There were four major themes identified: personal protective equipment, offer, need, and information. Few differences were found between how large and small groups were being used. CONCLUSIONS: The #Caremongering Facebook groups spread across the entire nation in a matter of days, engaging hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Social media appears to be a useful tool for spreading community-led solutions to address health and social needs.

AB  - COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is the current world health crisis, producing extensive morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Given the established roles of zinc in combating oxidative damage and viral infections, zinc is being trialed as a treatment modality against COVID-19. Zinc also has confirmed roles in both male and female reproduction. The possible depletion of zinc with the oxidative events of COVID-19 is especially relevant to the fertility of affected couples. This review aims to present the pathophysiology of COVID-19, especially in relation to reproductive function; the role of zinc in the COVID-19 disease process; and how zinc depletion in concert with cytokine storm and reactive oxygen species production could affect reproduction. It also highlights research areas to better the understanding of COVID-19 and its impact on fertility and potential ways to mitigate the impact.

AB  - Mass disasters result in extensive health problems and make health care delivery problematic, as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID-19 was initially considered a pulmonary problem, it soon became clear that various other organs were involved. Thus, many care providers, including kidney health personnel, were overwhelmed or developed burnout. This review aims to describe the spectrum of burnout in mass disasters and suggests solutions specifically for nephrology personnel by extending previous experience to the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout (a psychologic response to work-related stress) is already a frequent part of routine nephrology practice and, not surprisingly, is even more common during mass disasters due to increased workload and specific conditions, in addition to individual factors. Avoiding burnout is essential to prevent psychologic and somatic health problems in personnel as well as malpractice, understaffing, and inadequate health care delivery, all of which increase the health care burden of disasters. Burnout may be prevented by predisaster organizational measures, which include developing an overarching plan and optimizing health care infrastructure, and ad hoc disaster-specific measures that encompass both organizational and individual measures. Organizational measures include increasing safety, decreasing workload and fear of malpractice, optimizing medical staffing and material supplies, motivating personnel, providing mental health support, and enabling flexibility in working circumstances. Individual measures include training on coping with stress and problematic conditions, minimizing the stigma of emotional distress, and maintaining physical health. If these measures fall short, asking for external help is mandatory to avoid an inefficient disaster health care response. Minimizing burnout by applying these measures will improve health care provision, thus saving as many lives as possible.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of whether Europe is facing an opioid epidemic and utilises data from the European monitoring system on opioid use, harms and availability, to help assess the situation. Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the US, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market. Trends in the latter categories are poorly monitored and we may miss signs of emerging problems. Moreover, the economic recession following the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential to lead to resurgence in opioid use and harms.

AB  - Based on evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of chronic opioids, long-term users of prescription and illicit opioids comprise an unrecognized but growing population of Americans with compromised immune function and respiratory depression who may be at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization, prolonged ICU stay, adverse events, and death. This perspective is of broad clinical and public health importance because the US has the highest population of long-term users of prescription opioids, a sequel of a decade-long practice of opioid overprescribing in the US. For long-term opioid users who are hospitalized for COVID-19, clinicians face clinical challenges arising from the suppressive effects of opioids on the respiratory and immune functions, as well as the potential for adverse drug-drug interaction when opioids have to be continued in long-term users. More research is needed to further understand the association of long-term opioid use and susceptibility to COVID-19 and other emerging infections.

AB  - The wide disparity in coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related death rates based upon the ethnic origin is well established by now. The higher incidence of COVID-19 deaths amongst the healthcare staff belonging to black and minority ethnic (BAME) communities living in the United Kingdom has generated a great deal of concern and anxiety in clinicians. Public Health England (PHE) has outlined mitigation strategies after immense pressure from professional organisations and influential clinical leaders. Although seemingly well thought through, these measures fall short of addressing the professional, moral and emotional dilemma faced by the BAME clinicians who feel that they are being expected to choose between their duty towards their patients and the profession, and their responsibility to look after their own health.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization has become the present wellbeing worry to the whole world. There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. Cressa cretica is reported to show antitubercular, antibacterial and expectorant property. In this research, we aim to prospect the COVID-19 main protease crystal structure (Mpro; PDB ID: 6LU7) and the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica in order to understand the structural basis of their interactions. We examined the binding potential of active constituents of Cressa cretica plant to immensely conserved protein Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results suggest the effectiveness of 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid and Quercetin against standard drug Remdesivir. The active chemical constituents exhibited good docking scores, and interacts with binding site residues of Mpro by forming hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid showed the best affinity towards Mpro receptor which is one of the target enzymes required by SARS CoV-2 virus for replication suggesting it to be a novel research molecule. The potential of the active chemical constituents from Cressa cretica against the SARS-CoV-2 virus has best been highlighted through this study. Therefore, these chemical entities can be further scrutinized and provides direction for further consideration for in-vivo and in-vitro validations for the treatment of covid-19.

AB  - In an outbreak, effective detection of the aetiological agent(s) involved using molecular techniques is key to efficient diagnosis, early prevention and management of the spread. However, sequencing is necessary for mutation monitoring and tracking of clusters of transmission, development of diagnostics and for vaccines and drug development. Many sequencing methods are fast evolving to reduce test turn-around-time and to increase through-put compared to Sanger sequencing method; however, Sanger sequencing remains the gold standard for clinical research sequencing with its 99.99% accuracy This study sought to generate sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 using Sanger sequencing method and to characterize them for possible site(s) of mutations. About 30 pairs of primers were designed, synthesized, and optimized using endpoint PCR to generate amplicons for the full length of the virus. Cycle sequencing using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 and capillary gel electrophoresis on ABI 3130xl genetic analyser were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The sequence data generated were assembled and analysed for variations using DNASTAR Lasergene 17 SeqMan Ultra. Total length of 29,760bp of SARS-CoV-2 was assembled from the sample analysed and deposited in GenBank with accession number: MT576584. Blast result of the sequence assembly shows a 99.97% identity with the reference sequence. Variations were noticed at positions: nt201, nt2997, nt14368, nt16535, nt20334, and nt28841-28843, which caused amino acid alterations at the S (aa614) and N (aa203-204) regions. The mutations observed at S and N-gene in this study may be indicative of a gradual changes in the genetic coding of the virus hence, the need for active surveillance of the viral genome.

AB  - The global pandemic COVID-19 culminated in escalating biomedical waste (BMW) worldwide, and the management authorities are struggling with waste treatment. Bangladesh and India are two densely populated South Asian developing countries with limited resources. Both countries face mass community transmission of the disease, with India facing severe infections and deaths. Predictably, a large population might sum up to a large amount of COVID-19-related BMW. There is also the question of capacity, whether the existing BMW policies and regulations of the regions can manage the BMW strategically driven by the pressure of the pandemic. Here, we have shown a framework leading to further environmental and community transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic if the BMW generated at healthcare facilities and homes is not appropriately managed. The BMW, such as safety suits or personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, gloves, and shields, would likely damage the environment in the long run by creating microplastic pollution. Modification and modernization of the existing policies, plans, and guidelines on the proper management of the hospital and household infectious waste is suggested. Moreover, occupational health and safety assessments for waste management workers at the hospitals are recommended. Installing suitable capacity incinerators and related infrastructures are recommended for appropriate waste management. In the absence of incinerators, the existing industrial furnaces, cement kilns, and mobile incinerators can be used with a rapid impact assessment adhering to the appropriate implementations of the policies and guidelines.

AB  - Background: Preexisting alteration of the immune system by factors including older age, cardiovascular diseases, morbid obesity, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have detrimental effects on SARS-CoV-2 patients. Literature regarding SARS-CoV-2/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is still developing. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the existing literature pertaining to SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection systematically. Research records' characteristics and patients' clinical data were collected. Results: Seven research records were included, of which three were case series and four were case reports, reporting a total of 16 cases. There was one case of death, whereas (15/16) patients were discharged home. Majority of patients developed consistent clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2. All patients had initial positive RT-PCR results, and four cases had HIV-related lymphopenia. Conclusion: Although the current literature is still growing to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2/HIV coinfection, people living with HIV should adhere to the guidelines of healthy behavior and practice during this pandemic.

AB  - Immensely aggravated situation of COVID-19 has pushed the scientific community towards developing novel therapeutics to fight the pandemic. Small molecules can possibly prevent the spreading infection by targeting specific vital components of the viral genome. Non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) has emerged as a promising target for such inhibitor molecules. In this investigation, we docked bioactive molecules of tea onto the active site of Nsp15. Based on their docking scores, top three molecules (Barrigenol, Kaempferol, and Myricetin) were selected and their conformational behavior was analyzed via molecular dynamics simulations and MMPBSA calculations. The results indicated that the protein had well adapted the ligands in the binding pocket thereby forming stable complexes. These molecules displayed low binding energy during MMPBSA calculations, substantiating their strong association with Nsp15. The inhibitory potential of these molecules could further be examined by in-vivo and in-vitro investigations to validate their use as inhibitors against Nsp15 of SARS-CoV2.

Our framework outlines four prominent factors for building resilience in the industry: government response, technology innovation, local belongingness, and consumer and employee confidence. We argue that using such inclusive resilience; the tourism industry may transform into a new global economic order characterized by sustainable tourism, society's well-being, climate action, and the involvement of local communities. We also offer directions for future research in the area.

AB  - The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought into focus the key role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a cell surface receptor required for the virus to enter cells. SARS-CoV-2 can decrease cell surface ACE2 directly by internalization of ACE2 bound to the virus and indirectly by increased ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated shedding of ACE2. ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, kidney and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (AngII) by catalyzing the conversion of AngII into the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). The down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system and kidneys. Further, decreased ACE2 can cause gut dysbiosis, inflammation and potentially worsen the systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to elucidate the crucial role of ACE2 both as a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the implications for Coronavirus disease 19 and its associated cardiovascular and renal complications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is still escalating and has shaped an extraordinary and pressing need for rapid diagnostics with high sensitivity and specificity. Prompt diagnosis is the key to mitigate this situation. As several diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are already available and still others are under development, mandating a comprehensive review of the efficacy of existing tools and evaluate the potential of others. AREAS COVERED: Currently explored platforms for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and surveillance centered on qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, CRISPR, microarray, LAMP, lateral flow immunoassays, proteomics-based approaches, and radiological scans are overviewed and summarized in this review along with their advantages and downsides. A narrative literature review was carried out by accessing the freely available online databases to encapsulate the developments in medical diagnostics. EXPERT OPINION: An ideal detection method should be sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective, and should allow early diagnosis of the infection as near as possible to the point of care that could alter the current situation for the better. Medical diagnostics is a highly dynamic field as no diagnostic method available for SARS-CoV-2 detection offers a perfect solution and requires more attention and continuous R&D to challenge the present-day pandemic situation.

AB  - Patient-centered and physician-led innovations are key to promoting physicians as visionary leaders in the healthcare system especially during times of crises. COVID-19 has inspired some promising recent advancements within medicine worth noting, including improvements in telemedicine, 3-D printed personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, drug and vaccine development, sterilization of PPE allowing for reuse, and point of care testing; they highlight a broader lesson for how we might innovate better within medicine, even after the crisis has passed. As such, with the complexities of modern-day medicine, to continue to foster this culture of innovation, it is paramount that going forward, medical education adapt and embrace an innovation curriculum that prepares physicians and healthcare workers to work with their communities and researchers to confidently tackle any challenges that may present. Integrating innovation into our careers and medical training is important for advancement of the field and to be able to handle challenges that may present to the healthcare system.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is the most recent zoonotic outbreak of coronaviruses. Mostly, it invades the cells of the respiratory system by binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is also present in other organs like the kidney, testis, ovaries, breast, heart, and intestine, rendering them prone to be infected. The reproductive potential is a must for the sustenance of any species and it is our prime duty to safeguard the reproductive system of the present generation from such a deadly virus. The previously reported coronaviruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) had a detrimental impact on reproductive organs. There is a dearth of sufficient research to provide substantial evidence for the harmful effects of this novel virus on the reproductive system. Hence, our review compiles the knowledge available until now to boost research in this regard and to take the necessary steps in time. Main body of abstract: Here we tried to compile all the data available on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the reproductive system as well as vertical transmission of the virus. All related articles published from February to August 2020 were reviewed and thoroughly analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to affect the sperm concentration and motility, thus degrading the fertility of males. In females, it is suspected that this virus affects the oocyte quality and ovarian function, resulting in infertility or miscarriage. Traces of SARS-CoV-2 virus have also been found in the breast milk of the infected mothers and the semen of infected males. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported in some cases. Conclusion: Based on the literature review, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have the potential of affecting both male and female reproductive tracts. This review brings together the findings and observations made in the area of reproductive health during the current pandemic. The reproductive system of the young population is preordained for subsequent disorders, infertility, reduced sperm count, and motility. Therefore, the research and medical practices should focus on possible vulnerability being posed by SARS-CoV-2 to the gametes and future generations. We, hereby, recommend close monitoring of young and pregnant COVID-19 patients concerning reproductive health with utmost priority.

AB  - The pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading all over the world. Medical health care systems are in urgent need to diagnose this pandemic with the support of new emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and Big Data System. In this dichotomy study, we divide our research in two ways-firstly, the review of literature is carried out on databases of Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed and Wiley Online using keywords Coronavirus, Covid-19, artificial intelligence on Covid-19, Coronavirus 2019 and collected the latest information about Covid-19. Possible applications are identified from the same to enhance the future research. We have found various databases, websites and dashboards working on real time extraction of Covid-19 data. This will be conducive for future research to easily locate the available information. Secondly, we designed a nested ensemble model using deep learning methods based on long short term memory (LSTM). Proposed Deep-LSTM ensemble model is evaluated on intensive care Covid-19 confirmed and death cases of India with different classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure and mean absolute percentage error. Medical healthcare facilities are boosted with the intervention of AI as it can mimic human intelligence. Contactless treatment is possible only with the help of AI assisted automated health care systems. Furthermore, remote location self treatment is one of the key benefits provided by AI based systems.

AB  - The reproductive number R (or R0, the initial reproductive number in an immune-naive population) has long been successfully used to predict the likelihood of pathogen invasion, to gauge the potential severity of an epidemic, and to set policy around interventions. However, often ignored complexities have generated confusion around use of the metric. This is particularly apparent with the emergent pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We address some misconceptions about the predictive ability of the reproductive number, focusing on how it changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic. We hope that a better appreciation of the uses, nuances, and limitations of R and R0 facilitates a better understanding of epidemic spread, epidemic severity, and the effects of interventions in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The COVID-19 quarantine in China is thought to have reduced ambient air pollution. The overall exposure of the population also depends, however, on indoor air quality and human mobility and activities. Here, by integrating real-time mobility data and a questionnaire survey on time-activity patterns during the pandemic, we show that despite a decrease in ambient PM2.5 during the quarantine, the total population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 considering both indoor and outdoor environments increased by 5.7 μg m-3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-11.0 μg m-3). The increase in population-weighted exposure was mainly driven by a nationwide urban-to-rural population migration before the Spring Festival coupled with the freezing of the migration backward due to the quarantine, which increased household energy consumption and the fraction of people exposed to rural household air pollution indoors. Our analysis reveals an increased inequality of air pollution exposure during the quarantine and highlights the importance of household air pollution for population health in China.

AB  - State-of-the-art nanopore sequencing enables rapid and real-time identification of novel pathogens, which has wide application in various research areas and is an emerging diagnostic tool for infectious diseases including COVID-19. Nanopore translocation enables de novo sequencing with long reads (> 10 kb) of novel genomes, which has advantages over existing short-read sequencing technologies. Biological nanopore sequencing has already achieved success as a technology platform but it is sensitive to empirical factors such as pH and temperature. Alternatively, angstrom- and nano-scale solid-state nanopores, especially those based on two-dimensional (2D) membranes, are promising next-generation technologies as they can surpass biological nanopores in the variety of membrane materials, ease of defining pore morphology, higher nucleotide detection sensitivity, and facilitation of novel and hybrid sequencing modalities. Since the discovery of graphene, atomically-thin 2D materials have shown immense potential for the fabrication of nanopores with well-defined geometry, rendering them viable candidates for nanopore sequencing membranes. Here, we review recent progress and future development trends of 2D materials and their angstrom- and nano-scale pore-based nucleic acid (NA) sequencing including fabrication techniques and current and emerging sequencing modalities. In addition, we discuss the current challenges of translocation-based nanopore sequencing and provide an outlook on promising future research directions.

AB  - Coronaviruses that infect humans belong to the Alpha-coronavirus (including HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) genera. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs exist two different conformational states (lying or standing) in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Then, the differences in the immune responses to RBDs from these coronaviruses were analyzed structurally and immunologically. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies (antibody titers: 1.28×105; 2.75×105) were induced by the S-trimer with the RBD in the "standing" state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S-trimer with the RBD in the "lying" state (HCoV-229E, antibody titers: <500), and more S-trimer-specific antibodies were induced by the RBD in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (antibody titers: 6.72×105; 5×105) than HCoV-229E (antibody titers:1.125×103). Besides, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was lower than S-trimer, and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines.Importance Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in "lying" and "standing" states in the prefusion S-trimer structure. Here, we evaluated the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that the S-trimer and RBD are both candidates for subunit vaccines in Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) with a RBD "standing" state. However, for Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) with a RBD "lying" state, the S-trimer may be more suitable for subunit vaccines than the RBD. Our results will provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein in the future.

AB  - The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is known to enable viral invasion into human cells through direct binding to host receptors including ACE2. An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses speculating on the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. Here, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike binding receptor. Recombinant forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells, and by using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for a direct interaction between the viral spike protein to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Finally, removing basigin from the surface of human lung epithelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 results in no change in their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the pressing need for clarity on which viral targets may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted essential health services. Simultaneously, it has created opportunities for citizens to raise awareness of personal hygiene, mask wearing, and other preventive measures. This brief report aims to clarify the epidemiological trends of measles and rubella in Japan and to explore future challenges for controlling these diseases during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Japan eliminated measles in 2015, the number of measles patients has gradually increased since then, and reached 744 in 2019. In the 2010s, Japan experienced two large rubella epidemics, and the majority of the patients were reported in Tokyo and other metropolitan areas. While the transmission of measles and rubella seems to be suppressed during the COVID-19 pandemic, closing the gap in routine childhood vaccination will be challenging in any country. Moreover, supplementary immunization campaigns for adults have also been disrupted, and they must be invigorated. While the pandemic has a devastating effect on a global scale, it should be utilized as a good opportunity to regain faith in vaccines, implement an evidence-based vaccination policy, and strengthen international cooperation.

AB  - COVID-19 has resulted in a pandemic after its first appearance in a pneumonia patient in China in early December 2019. As per WHO, this global outbreak of novel COVID-19 has resulted in 28,329,790 laboratory-confirmed cases and 911,877 deaths which have been reported from 210 countries as on 12th Sep 2020. The major symptoms at the beginning of COVID-19 are fever (98%), tussis (76%), sore throat (17%), rhinorrhea (2%), chest pain (2%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%). Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (61.1%), cardiac dysrhythmia (44.4%), shock (30.6%), hemoptysis (5%), stroke (5%), acute cardiac injury (12%), acute kidney injury (36.6%), dermatological symptoms with maculopapular exanthema (36.1%), and death can occur in severe cases. Even though human coronavirus (CoV) is mainly responsible for the infections of the respiratory tract, some studies have shown CoV (in case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) to possess potential to spread to extra-pulmonary organs including the nervous system as well as gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Patients infected with COVID-19 have also shown symptoms associated with neurological and enteric infection like disorders related to smell/taste, loss of appetite, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and pain in the abdomen. In the present review, we attempt to evaluate the understanding of basic mechanisms involved in clinical manifestations of COVID-19, mainly focusing on interaction of COVID-19 with gut-brain axis. This review combines both biological characteristics of the virus and its clinical manifestations in order to comprehend an insight into the fundamental potential mechanisms of COVID-19 virus infection, and thus endorse in the advancement of prophylactic and treatment strategies.

AB  - The arrival of novel health crisis by a novel member of coronavirus group named as SARS-CoV-2 by WHO took the whole world in global emergency by affecting 206 countries. The virus infects 205 countries with 86,839,226 confirmed cases, 61,565,949 recoveries and 1,876,243 deaths as on 6th January 2021. Evidences pointed out the fact that virus might first originated in bats in China and it takes only two months to cover almost every country of the world. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Beta coronavirus and is enveloped, positive sense and single stranded RNA virus. The treatment would be difficult as SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus the mutation rate is higher in comparison to DNA viruses. The virus infection also leads to generation of effective protective immune response of TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF etc. that may help in virus elimination. The speed of the global spread of the current pandemic is of major concern and it creates a significant threat to economic and human health. In India, the infection spreads with an infection and fatality rate of the disease are 1.7 and 2.8% respectively. By this review we want to emphasize the actual situation and major factors associated with COVID-19 pandemic, its significance, destructions, important findings, treatments and preventive measures taken by all nations to provide better cure without having much loss.

AB  - The proliferation and transmission of viruses has become a threat to worldwide biosecurity, as exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis of viral infection and disease control have always been critical. Virus detection can be achieved based on various plasmonic phenomena, including propagating surface plasmon resonance (SPR), localized SPR, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, surface-enhanced fluorescence and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. The present review covers all available information on plasmonic-based virus detection, and collected data on these sensors based on several parameters. These data will assist the audience in advancing research and development of a new generation of versatile virus biosensors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, there is dearth of trained laboratorians and strengthened laboratory systems to provide adequate and quality laboratory services for enhanced HIV control. In response to this challenge, in 2007, the African Centre for Integrated Laboratory Training (ACILT) was established in South Africa with a mission to train staffs from countries with high burdens of diseases in skills needed to strengthen sustainable laboratory systems. This study was undertaken to assess the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to other laboratory staff, and to identify enabling and obstructive factors to their implementation. METHODS: We used Kirkpatrick model to determine training effectiveness by assessing the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to participant's work environment, along with measuring enabling and obstructive factors. In addition to regular course evaluations at ACILT (pre and post training), in 2015 we sent e-questionnaires to 867 participants in 43 countries for course participation between 2008 and 2014. Diagnostics courses included Viral Load, and systems strengthening included strategic planning and Biosafety and Biosecurity. SAS v9.44 and Excel were used to analyze retrospective de-identified data collected at six months pre and post-training. RESULTS: Of the 867 participants, 203 (23.4%) responded and reported average improvements in accuracy and timeliness in Viral Load programs and to systems strengthening. For Viral Load testing, frequency of corrective action for unsatisfactory proficiency scores improved from 57 to 91%, testing error rates reduced from 12.9% to 4.9%; 88% responders contributed to the first national strategic plan development and 91% developed strategies to mitigate biosafety risks in their institutions. Key enabling factors were team and management support, and key obstructive factors included insufficient resources and staff's resistance to change. CONCLUSIONS: Training at ACILT had a documented positive impact on strengthening the laboratory capacity and laboratory workforce and substantial cost savings. ACILT's investment produced a multiplier effect whereby national laboratory systems, personnel and leadership reaped training benefits. This laboratory training centre with a global clientele contributed to improve existing laboratory services, systems and networks for the HIV epidemic and is now being leveraged for COVID-19 testing that has infected 41,332,899 people globally.

AB  - In the face of a public health crisis full of uncertainty, how should the community respond in order to effectively reduce the negative impact of the epidemic on public health? This article takes a Chinese rural community located near Wuhan City as an example to explore the mechanism of how collaborative leadership enhanced collective action in community governance against the COVID-19 pandemic. Early blockading to prevent transmission into the community, strict maintenance of social distance to prevent internal diffusion, timely elimination of public panic, and efficient guarantees of household supplies have proven effective in preventing the spread of the epidemic. Our research shows that collaborative leadership can achieve these goals mainly by effectively integrated local knowledge, modern information technology, and social self-organization, and then promoting the realization of collective action of community epidemic prevention and control. The lessons and implications for public health are discussed.

AB  - Microbes possess a tremendous potential to interact with their surroundings and have continued to shape the future of all life forms existing on earth. Of all the groups of microbes, viruses are the most nefarious creatures which cannot be solely classified as living or non-living but still pose the greatest threats to the biosphere. Viruses are minuscule, diverse and are probably the only entities that exhibit non-mutualistic association with other lifeforms while retaining their ability to infect and hijack any of the existing living being on the planet. The latest global devastation, caused by novel SARS-CoV-2, is unparalleled in the last century. This review encompasses the mysterious origin of this virus by tracking its lineage, which may help to decode the conundrum of SARS-CoV-2 and shed more light on its epidemiology. The implications and the challenge posed by this virus to the scientific community to the medical community and the economy at large are reflected. Also discussed is the paradigm shift brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic on the human psyche and their behaviour.

AB  - In manifold learning, the intrinsic geometry of the manifold is explored and preserved by identifying the optimal local neighborhood around each observation. It is well known that when a Riemannian manifold is unfolded correctly, the observations lying spatially near to the manifold, should remain near on the lower dimension as well. Due to the nonlinear properties of manifold around each observation, finding such optimal neighborhood on the manifold is a challenge. Thus, a sub-optimal neighborhood may lead to erroneous representation and incorrect inferences. In this paper, we propose a rotation-based affinity metric for accurate graph Laplacian approximation. It exploits the property of aligned tangent spaces of observations in an optimal neighborhood to approximate correct affinity between them. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets have been performed. It is observed that proposed method outperforms existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques in low-dimensional representation for synthetic datasets. The results on real world datasets like COVID-19 prove that our approach increases the accuracy of classification by enhancing Laplacian regularization.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemics accounting for the mitigation measures, for the introduction or removal of the quarantine, and for the effect of vaccination when and if introduced. The methods used include the derivation of the Pandemic Equation describing the mitigation measures via the evolution of the growth time constant in the Pandemic Equation resulting in an asymmetric pandemic curve with a steeper rise than a decrease and mitigation measures. The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time. The Pandemic Equation parameters extracted from the well advanced pandemic curves can be used for predicting the pandemic evolution in the localities, where the pandemics is still in the initial stages. Using the multiple pandemic locations for the parameter extraction allows for the uncertainty quantification in predicting the pandemic evolution using the introduced Pandemic Equation. Compared with other pandemic models our approach allows for easier parameter extraction amenable to using Artificial Intelligence models.

AB  - Currently COVID-19 is spreading in a large scale while no efficient vaccine has been produced. How to found a high effective drug for COVID-19 is very necessarily. We established a satisfied quantitative structure-activity relationship model by gene expression programming to predict the IC50 value of natural compounds. 27 natural products were optimized by heuristic method in CODESSA program to build a liner model. Basis on it, only 2 descriptors were selected and utilized to build a nonlinear model in gene expression programming. The square of correlation coefficient and s2 of heuristic method were 0.80 and 0.10, respectively. In gene expression programming, the square of correlation coefficient and mean square error for training set were 0.91 and 0.04. The square of correlation coefficient and mean square error for test set are 0.86 and 0.1. This nonlinear model has stronger predictive ability to develop the targeted drugs of covid-19.

AB  - As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) continues to spread worldwide, it has become evident that the morbidity and mortality rates clearly vary across nations. Although several factors may account for this disparity, striking differences within and between populations indicate that ethnicity might impact COVID‑19 clinical outcomes, reflecting the 'color of disease'. Therefore, the role of key biological variables that could interplay with viral spreading and severity indices has attracted increasing attention, particularly among non‑Caucasian populations. Although the links between vitamin D status and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 remain elusive, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D signaling, targeting several immune‑mediated pathways, may offer potential benefits at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the vitamin D status is modulated by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including skin type (pigmentation), melanin polymers may also play a role in variable COVID‑19 outcomes among diverse population settings. Moreover, apart from the well‑known limiting effects of melanin on the endogenous production of vitamin D, the potential crosstalk between the pigmentary and immune system may also require special attention concerning the current pandemic. The present review article aimed to shed light on a range of mostly overlooked host factors, such as vitamin D status and melanin pigments, that may influence the course and outcome of COVID‑19.

AB  - Introduction The COVID 19 pandemic resulted in local and institutional restrictions with significant effects on the clinical environment for graduate medical education, displacing residents from non-emergency medicine (EM) based rotations. Additionally, resident physicians considered patients under investigation (PUI) were furloughed from clinical practice. The necessity for supplemental learning in a virtual setting prompted the development of an online homeschooling curriculum that incorporated back to the basics textbook learning, application, and retention via virtual sessions for the quarantined and furloughed learners. Methods An online homeschooling curriculum was developed to replace the cancelled clinical experiences for EM residents and for those who were quarantined utilizing Google Classroom and Zoom teleconference software. After completion of their quarantine or return to normal rotation schedule, residents were asked to evaluate the homeschooling curriculum using an anonymous survey. Results A total of 12 residents participated in the homeschooling program over eight weeks during the spring of 2020. Of the nine residents surveyed, 88.8% percent felt the homeschooling added to their knowledge of EM, 100% found the online format easy to use, and 88.8% stated it helped maintain a sense of social connection to peers and faculty. Conclusion An online homeschooling program was considered an effective means of providing an opportunity for synchronous and continuous education for EM resident physicians. This program could be sustainable long term to fill in knowledge gaps or supplement remediation in emergency resident education, post pandemic.

AB  - Increased survival with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) has led to a large number of patients with LVADs presenting for noncardiac surgeries (NCS). With studies showing that a trained noncardiac anesthesiologist can safely manage these patients when they present for NCS, it is vital that all anesthesiologists understand the LVAD physiology and its implications in various surgeries. This is even more relevant during the current pandemic in which these complex cardiopulmonary interactions may be even more challenging in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The authors describe a case of a patient with COVID-19 with an LVAD who needed thoracoscopic decortication for recurrent complex pleural effusion and briefly discuss unique challenges presented and their management.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causal agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. They are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly, and pathogenicity. The approximately 33.8 kDa M pro protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and is highly conserved among several coronaviruses, indicating that M pro could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses. Methods: Herein, we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease (6LU7), and also screened 50,000 natural compounds from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target. Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands. The 11 best selected ligands, namely ZINC1845382, ZINC1875405, ZINC2092396, ZINC2104424, ZINC44018332, ZINC2101723, ZINC2094526, ZINC2094304, ZINC2104482, ZINC3984030, and ZINC1531664, are mainly classified as beta-carboline, alkaloids, and polyflavonoids, and all displayed interactions with dyad CYS145 and HIS41 from the protease pocket in a similar way as other known ligands. Conclusions: Our results suggest that these 11 molecules could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 protease and may be subsequently tested in vitro and in vivo to develop novel drugs against this virus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to analyze how the social isolation measures and closed borders affected the health and economy in an international border region. METHOD: descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in the western region of Parana, Brazil, using an electronic form created using Google® forms. A sample of 2,510 people was addressed. Descriptive analysis and the Chi-square test were performed, with a level of significance established at 5%. This public opinion survey, addressing unidentified participants, is in accordance with Resolutions 466/2012 and 510/2016. RESULTS: the participants were 41.5 years old on average, most were women and worked in the education sector; 41.9% reported that the closing of borders/commercial businesses negatively influenced income; 17.7% reported the possibility of losing their jobs; 89.0% consider that a larger number of people would be sick if the borders/commercial had not been closed; 63.7% believe the health services are not prepared to deal with the pandemic; 74.9% realize that the Brazilian Unified Health System may not have sufficient service capacity; 63.4% reported anxiety; and 75.6% of commercial workers will experience changes in their income level. CONCLUSION: the closing of international borders and commercial businesses was related to a perception of physical and mental changes, job loss, and decreased income.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors including age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use, has been reported in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who experienced adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death. RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9-15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04-1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death. Male sex and smoking did not significantly affect mortality. At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99-1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, male sex, hypertension, and smoking did not independently correlate with fatal outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, was suggested to be predictive of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Here, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI). RESULTS: A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95%CI 0.72-1.04; I2 = 75.52% and 1.87; 95%CI 1.25-2.49; I2 = 97.81%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.74 (95%CI 0.98-7.66). CONCLUSION: High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to cytokines and the phenomenon of cytokine storm into mainstream discussions. In this disease specifically, a cytokine storm overwhelming immune response contributes to the pathophysiology and mortality of the COVID-19 infection. Analogous perturbed immune reactions are experienced in polytrauma patients, compromising local tissue healing while threatening multiple organ systems. The expanding field of osteoimmunology should contribute to the orthopaedic community's understanding of how the immune system response, whether normal or pathologic, affects the whole body outcome of our patients.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions worldwide and has posed an immediate need for effective pharmacological interventions. Ever since the outbreak was declared, the medical fraternity across the world is facing a unique situation of offering assistance and simultaneously generating reliable data with high-quality evidence to extend the scope of finding a treatment. With no proven vaccine or other interventions available hitherto, there is a frenzied urgency of sharing preliminary data from laboratories and trials to shape a global response against the virus. Several clinical trials with investigational and approved repurposed therapeutics have shown promising results. This review aims to compile the information of the reported molecules approved for emergency use and those under clinical trials and still others with good results in the studies conducted so far. Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to mutation; thus, the possibility of gaining resistance to available drugs is high. Consequently, a cocktail therapy based on drug interaction with different stages of its replicative cycle is desirable to reduce the chances of evolving drug resistance. Since this virus encodes several proteins, including 16 nonstructural and 4 structural proteins, this review also offers an insight into potential drug targets within SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background/Aims: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recognized to have variable clinical manifestations. The clinical presentation of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) having COVID-19 is unclear. Methods: We identified articles reporting about the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in those with underlying IBD from PubMed and Embase. The studies, irrespective of design or language, were included. The overall pooled frequency of various symptoms was estimated. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of studies. Results: Eleven studies, including 1,325 patients, were included in the pooled analysis. The pooled estimates for clinical presentation were; fever: 67.53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.38-83.88), cough: 59.58% (95% CI, 45.01-72.63), diarrhea: 27.26% (95% CI, 19.51-36.69), running nose: 27% (95% CI, 15.26-43.19) and dyspnea: 25.29% (95% CI, 18.52-33.52). The pooled prevalence rates for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting were 13.08% (95% CI, 9.24-18.19), 10.08% (95% CI, 5.84-16.85) and 8.80% (95% CI, 4.43-16.70) per 100 population, respectively. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in IBD patients is similar to the general population.

AB  - Haemostatic unbalance is often observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and patients with severe disease are at high risk of developing thromboembolic complications. Viscoelastic methods (VEMs), including thrombelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (TEM), provide data on the nature of haemostatic disturbance. In this systematic review, we assessed the performance of TEG and TEM in the assessment of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with COVID-19. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and bioRxiv were systematically searched for clinical studies evaluating TEG and/or TEM variables in COVID-19 individuals. Ten studies, with a total of 389 COVID-19 patients, were included, and VEMs were performed in 292 of these patients. Most patients (90%) presented severe COVID-19 and required mechanical ventilation. TEG and TEM variables showed that these patients displayed hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown, despite the use of appropriate thromboprophylaxis. However, the mechanism underlying these phenomena and their clinical significance in COVID-19 patients who developed thrombosis, is still not clear. Further studies are warranted if VEMs might help to identify those at highest risk of thrombotic events and who therefore may derive the greatest benefit from antithrombotic therapy.

AB  - It has been a year since the first person on Earth became infected with a new type of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing infectious acute respiratory disease COVID-19 with relatively high morbidity and mortality. The most endangered population by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are healthcare professionals, the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. Due to the fast community spread, governments of different European countries introduced precaution measures including limited socializing of people, closing of most public services and introducing mandatory facial protection. The hope for a return to the life before the pandemic is the development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which would presumably reduce the incidence of severe forms of COVID-19 and prevent the massive spread of the disease. At the end of November, we have 13 clinical trials in phase III involving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on inactivated viruses, recombinant non-pathogenic viral vectors and proteins. The first mRNA-based vaccine is currently being evaluated in phase II/III clinical trial and is already being distributed and applied to high-risk population in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Israel, followed by the countries of the European Union, including the Czech Republic. In the review article we present currently ongoing clinical studies with a special focus on the phase III clinical trials and discuss the mechanisms of action of each type of vaccine.

AB  - Since the earliest stages of the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) spread, the elderly has been identified as the most vulnerable and health authorities have rightly focused on that population. Minor attention was paid to pediatric populations and their emotional reactions. Actually, children and adolescents faced severe anxiety, fear and stress conditions. An efficient management of the pandemic, therefore, must take into account the pediatric population which cannot be neglected as a minor matter compared to the elderly, the economy and health care. Since the lockdown time is over, children and adolescents must recover sociality, return to living in the open air, rediscover playing, free time, aiming for the beauty of their everyday life. In order to mitigate the long-term impact of COVID-19, the key response is the reassuring presence of the adult as 'a secure base'. The current study aimed to collect an overview of the recent references that report evidence on the role of adults in containing pandemic anxiety COVID-19 in pediatric populations, suggesting the need to ensure a reassuring presence of the adult, an effective child-parent communication, a child-friendly day and a long-lasting shared time with parents.

AB  - PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancelation of traditional on-site clinical rotations for medical students across the country. Radiology educators have had to rapidly adapt to a new, virtual educational landscape. We describe our experience restructuring a Trauma and Emergency Radiology Elective to an online format and present survey data obtained from students who completed the course. METHODS: This elective is a 4-week course offered to third and fourth year medical students at a large Level 1 Trauma Center. Changes to the traditional rotation included assigning an increased number of self-study educational resources, independent review of unknown cases using a virtual workstation, and online interactive conferences. At the conclusion of each block, students were asked to complete post-course feedback surveys. RESULTS: Thirteen students enrolled in this online course; 92% submitted post-course surveys. Students strongly agreed that the course was clinically relevant, with accessible, engaging material (average score, 4.92/5), and 91.7% of students were very likely to recommend this rotation to others. Students reported improved post-course confidence in ordering and interpreting imaging studies. A majority (60%) of students who had previously taken an on-site course would have preferred a course that combined traditional and online learning elements. CONCLUSIONS: The success of our online rotation highlights the merits of self-directed learning and flipped-classroom techniques. Many of the principles incorporated into this course could be applied and/or modified to increase medical student engagement when students return to the hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical professionals are exposed to multiple and often excessive demands in their work environment. Low-intensity internet interventions allow them to benefit from psychological support even when institutional help is not available. Focusing on enhancing psychological resources-self-efficacy and perceived social support-makes an intervention relevant for various occupations within the medical profession. Previously, these resources were found to operate both individually or sequentially with self-efficacy either preceding social support (cultivation process) or following it (enabling process). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 variants of Med-Stress, a self-guided internet intervention that aims to improve the multifaceted well-being of medical professionals. METHODS: This study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N=1240) were recruited mainly via media campaigns and social media targeted ads. They were assigned to 1 of the following 4 groups: experimental condition reflecting the cultivation process, experimental condition reflecting the enabling process, active comparator enhancing only self-efficacy, and active comparator enhancing only perceived social support. Outcomes included 5 facets of well-being: job stress, job burnout, work engagement, depression, and job-related traumatic stress. Measurements were taken on the web at baseline (time 1), immediately after intervention (time 2), and at a 6-month follow-up (time 3). To analyze the data, linear mixed effects models were used on the intention-to-treat sample. The trial was partially blinded as the information about the duration of the trial, which was different for experimental and control conditions, was public. RESULTS: At time 2, job stress was lower in the condition reflecting the cultivation process than in the one enhancing social support only (d=-0.21), and at time 3, participants in that experimental condition reported the lowest job stress when compared with all 3 remaining study groups (ds between -0.24 and -0.41). For job-related traumatic stress, we found a significant difference between study groups only at time 3: stress was lower in the experimental condition in which self-efficacy was enhanced first than in the active comparator enhancing solely social support (d=-0.24). The same result was found for work engagement (d=-0.20), which means that it was lower in exactly the same condition that was found beneficial for stress relief. There were no differences between study conditions for burnout and depression neither at time 2 nor at time 3. There was a high dropout in the study (1023/1240, 82.50% at posttest), reflecting the pragmatic nature of this trial. CONCLUSIONS: The Med-Stress internet intervention improves some components of well-being-most notably job stress-when activities are completed in a specific sequence. The decrease in work engagement could support the notion of dark side of this phenomenon, but further research is needed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health emergency caused by a newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The entire scientific community across the globe is working diligently to tackle this unprecedented challenge. In silico studies have played a crucial role in the current situation by expediting the process of identification of novel potential chemotypes targeting the viral receptors. In this study, we have made efforts to identify molecules that can potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has a large flexible binding pocket that can accommodate various chemically diverse ligands but a complete occupation of the binding cavity is necessary for efficient inhibition and stability. We augmented glide three-tier molecular docking protocol with water thermodynamics to screen molecules obtained from three different compound libraries. The diverse hits obtained through docking studies were scored against generated WaterMap to enrich the quality of results. Five molecules were selected from each compound library on the basis of scores and protein-ligand complementarity. Further MD simulations on the proposed molecules affirm the stability of these molecules in the complex. MM-GBSA results and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis also confirm the thermodynamic stability of proposed molecules. This study also presumably steers the structure determination of many ligand-main protease complexes using x-ray diffraction methods. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Prone positioning has been shown to improve oxygenation for decades. However, proning in awake, non-intubated patients gained acceptance in the last few months since the onset of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To overcome the shortage of ventilators, to decrease the overwhelming burden on intensive care beds in the pandemic era, and also as invasive ventilation was associated with poor outcomes, proning of awake, spontaneously breathing patients gathered momentum. Being an intervention with minimal risk and requiring minimum assistance, it is now a globally accepted therapy to improve oxygenation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. We thus reviewed the literature of awake proning in non-intubated patients and described a safe protocol to practice the same. How to cite this article: Sodhi K, Chanchalani G.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The unusual pneumonia outbreak that originated in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019 was found to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19. METHODS: In this work, we have performed an in silico design and prediction of potential siRNAs based on genetic diversity and recombination patterns, targeting various genes of SARS-CoV-2 for antiviral therapeutics. We performed extensive sequence analysis to analyze the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, and to identify the possible source of virus reservoirs and recombination patterns, and the evolution of the virus as well as we designed the siRNAs which can be used as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships indicated high sequence identity and closed clusters with many types of coronavirus. In our analysis, the full-genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed the highest sequence (nucleotide) identity with SARS-bat-ZC45 (87.7%). The overall sequence identity ranged from 74.3% to 87.7% with selected SARS viruses. The recombination analysis indicated the bat SARS virus is a potential recombinant and serves as a major and minor parent. We have predicted 442 siRNAs and finally selected only 19 functional, and potential siRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The siRNAs were predicted and selected based on their greater potency and specificity. The predicted siRNAs need to be validated experimentally for their effective binding and antiviral activity.

AB  - A pneumonia outbreak of unknown aetiology emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The causative organism was identified on the 7th of January 2020 as a novel coronavirus (nCoV or 2019-nCoV), later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The resulting coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has infected over 37 57.8 million individuals, resulted in over 1 1.3 million deaths, and has led to an unprecedented impact on research activities worldwide. Extraordinary challenges have also been imposed upon medical and surgical trainees following re-deployment to full-time clinical duties. Moreover, the introduction of travel restrictions and strict lockdown measures have forced the closure of many institutions and laboratories working on research unrelated to the pandemic. The lockdown has similarly stifled supply chains and slowed research and development endeavours, whilst research charities have endured significant financial strains that have since reshaped the allocation and availability of funds. Worldwide scientific adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic has also been observed through unprecedented levels of international collaboration as well as the uprise of remote telecommunication platforms. Although the long-term consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic on research and academic training is difficult to ascertain, the current crises will inevitably shape working and teaching patterns for years to come. To this end, we provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on scientific research and funding, as well as academic medical and surgical training.

The Grand Magal took place this year on 6 October, in Touba, Senegal is the only MG event organized in 2020. This Muslim pilgrimage gathers about four million Muslim Mourides from Senegal and beyond. No significant increase of COVID-19 cases was therefore observed at the national level in the weeks following the Grand Magal. This successful strategy is an invitation to better promote community commitments by public authorities in their various strategies.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), is a new strain of β-coronavirus. At the time of the current pandemic, pregnant women fear of infection by this pathogen and related consequences both for themselves and for their children. Adaptive changes occurring in the body of a pregnant woman can increase her susceptibility to infections, especially when it concerns the cardiopulmonary system. Clinical data relating to infection by this pathogen, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women are still limited. Most of the cases in which these data are available apply to the third trimester of pregnancy. This article provides an overview of a current knowledge and recommendations regarding the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and its impact on the pregnancy outcome.

Regulatory agencies from the European Union, Unites States and the United Kingdom agree that vaccinations are contraindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. This position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) agrees with these recommendations and clarifies that there is no contraindication to administer these vaccines to allergic patients who do not have a history of an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Importantly, as is the case for any medication, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, we provide a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centres. We also describe potentially allergenic/immunogenic components of the approved vaccines and propose a workup to identify the responsible allergen. Close collaboration between academia, regulatory agencies and vaccine producers will facilitate approaches for patients at risks, such as incremental dosing of the second injection or desensitisation. Finally, we identify unmet research needs and propose a concerted international roadmap towards precision diagnosis and management to minimise the risk of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate their broader and safer use.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has currently caused the pandemic with a high progressive speed, and has been considered as the global public health crisis in 2020. This new member of the coronavirus family has created a potentially fatal disease, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Despite the continuous efforts of researchers to find effective vaccines and drugs for COVID-19, there is still no success in this matter. AREAS COVERED: Here, the literature regarding the COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in the clinical trials, as well as main candidates in pre-clinical stages for development and research, were reviewed. These candidates have been developed under five different major platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine, mRNA-based vaccine, DNA vaccines, inactivated virus, and viral-vector based vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: There are several limitations in the field of the rapid vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2, and other members of the coronavirus family such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The key challenges of designing an effective vaccine within a short time include finding the virulence ability of an emerging virus and potential antigen, choosing suitable experimental models and efficient route of administration, the immune-response study, designing the clinical trials, and determining the safety, as well as efficacy.

It seems that this infection will continue period which is long enough to obligate modifications in both life style and health care systems. Because chronic liver diseases (CLD) are prevalent all over the world, it is expected to manage patients with CLD and COVID-19. The aim of this review was to shade the light on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of patients with CLD and how to give medical care to CLD patients during COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The school is one of the most critical social, educational, and training institutions and the main pillar of education in society. Education and, consequently, educational environments have the highest effect on the mentality, development, growth, welfare, concentration, performance, and learning efficiency of students. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to examine the effects of environmental ergonomics on the learning and cognition of pre-school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study was carried out as a review article using some keywords, namely "children", "learning", "pre-school", "COVID-19", "ergonomics", and "environmental factors". Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched to find related articles. RESULTS: Factors like color, form, and layout of classrooms, lighting and ventilation, interior decoration, and educational equipment are effective in creating interest and motivation for students to learn. CONCLUSIONS: A review of these articles showed that the presence of ergonomics in educational spaces for children increases the quality of learning and reduces stress and anxiety, and by observing health protocols, a healthy and safe environment can be provided for students.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). This disease has been raising international public health concerns since its recent outbreak in December 2019. As the virus is easily transmitted by respiratory droplets, all hospital departments needed to change their practices in an attempt to control the spread of this virus. Burn units and clinics are particularly affected by this pandemic because of the larger risk of contamination for both patients and caregivers. Furthermore, cross-clinical aspects especially pain management and complications such as coagulopathy might be caused by both extensive burns and COVID-19 infections, which makes the management of these patients particularly challenging. That's why we covered both main aspects in this review. In addition, we present briefly a synthesis of guidelines from several entities to help manage the health crisis and provide optimal care for all burn patients during this pandemic.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for left atrial appendage thrombosis (LAAT) detection should be limited to situations of absolute necessity. We sought to identify the main conventional and functional echocardiographic parameters associated with LAAT on TEE in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients planned for electrical cardioversion (ECV). This retrospective study included 125 consecutive NVAF patients (71.5±7.8 yrs, 75 males), who underwent TEE at our Institution between April 2016 and January 2020, to exclude LAAT before scheduled ECV. All patients underwent a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) implemented with speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) analysis of left atrial (LA) strain and strain rate (SR) parameters. 28% of patients were diagnosed with LAAT, while 72% without LAAT. Compared to controls, patients with LAAT had significantly higher CHA2DS2-Vasc Score and average E/e' ratio, and significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover, LA-peak positive global atrial strain (GSA+) and LA-SR parameters were significantly reduced in patients with LAAT. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, differently from CHA2DS2-Vasc Score, LVEF (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.81-0.97, p = 0.01), average E/e' ratio (OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.41-3.98, p = 0.001), and LA-GSA+ (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.36-0-90, p = 0.01) were independently associated with LAAT. LA-GSA+ (optimal cut-off ≤ 9.1%, AUC 0.95) showed the highest diagnostic performance. Finally, a strong linear correlation of LA peak-to-peak SR with both LA appendage filling (r = 0.86) and emptying (r = 0.83) velocities was demonstrated. TTE implemented with STE analysis of LA mechanics improves thrombotic risk assessment of NVAF patients.

AB  - The rapid identification of pathogenic microorganisms plays a crucial role in the timely diagnosis and treatment strategies during a global pandemic, especially in resource-limited area. Herein, we present a sensitive biosensor strategy depended on botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain (BoNT/A LC) activated complex assay (BACA). BoNT/A LC, the surrogate of BoNT/A which embodying the most potent biological poisons, could serve as an ultrasensitive signal reporter with high signal-to-noise ratio to avoid common strong background response, poor stability and low intensity of current biosensor methods. A nanoparticle hybridization system, involving specific binding probes that recognize pathogenic 16S rRNAs or SARS-CoV-2 gene site, was developed to measure double-stranded biotinylated target DNA containing a single-stranded overhang using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assay and colorimetric method. The method is validated widely by six different bacteria strains and severe acute respiratory related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid, demonstrating a single cell or 1 aM nucleic acid detecting sensitivity. This detection strategy offers a solution for general applications and has a great prospect to be a simple instrument-free colorimetric tool, especially when facing public health emergency.

AB  - Coronaviruses spike (S) glycoproteins mediate viral entry into host cells by binding to host receptors. However, how the S1 subunit undergoes conformational changes for receptor recognition has not been elucidated in Alphacoronavirus. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the HCoV-229E S trimer in prefusion state with two conformations. The activated conformation may pose the potential exposure of the S1-RBDs by decreasing of the interaction area between the S1-RBDs and the surrounding S1-NTDs and S1-RBDs compared to the closed conformation. Furthermore, structural comparison of our structures with the previously reported HCoV-229E S structure showed that the S trimers trended to open the S2 subunit from the closed conformation to open conformation, which could promote the transition from pre- to postfusion. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms involved in S glycoprotein-mediated Alphacoronavirus entry and have implications for vaccine and therapeutic antibody design.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pandemic is sweeping the world and causing global crises. The lack of effective methods of early diagnosis and accurate detection may result in severe infection as well as mortality. Therefore, it is urgently required that rapid, selective, and accurate techniques for detecting pathogenic viruses are developed. Nanotechnology-based biosensors are finding many applications in biological detection, which may address these issues and realize direct detection of molecular targets in real time. Among various nanoplatforms, optical nanobiosensors have aroused much interest due to their inherent advantages of high sensitivity and direct readout. In this review, a summary of recent progress on the optical biosensors based on nanotechnology for pathogenic virus detection is provided, with focus on quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), noble metal nanoparticles, and organic fluorescent molecules-based nanoprobes and chemiluminescence assays. These representative studies demonstrate appealing performance as biosensors and hold great promise for clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Although COVID-19 is considered to be primarily a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Yet, there is no consensus on the consequences of CNS infections. Here, we used three independent approaches to probe the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain. First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in infected and neighboring neurons. However, no evidence for type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Second, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in vivo. Finally, in autopsies from patients who died of COVID-19, we detect SARS-CoV-2 in cortical neurons and note pathological features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV-2 and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 5 July 2020, more than 11.1 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 528,000 deaths. More than 6.03 million people have recovered. The entire world population currently faces enormous challenges (i.e., social, environmental, health, and economic) due to the impact of COVID-19. In this regard, the affected countries are now trying to slow down the virus's transmission through social-distancing, lockdowns, increasing the number of tests and treatment facilities. There have been four lockdowns (25 March 2020-31 May 2020), and two unlock periods (1 June-31 July 2020) in India. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been analyzed using MODIS satellite data during various phases of lockdowns over India. With the implementation of lockdown steps, AOD values dropped significantly over various regions. A significant reduction in AOD over the North-Central regions (up to -50%) compared to the regions in the South or Northeast India. The AOD over these regions was significantly affected by the lock/unlock phases. It was also observed that there was a considerable buildup of AOD during the pre-lockdown period in the year 2020 as compared to the past two years.

AB  - With the increased spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, more patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are being reported worldwide. This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to analyse the clinical features, proposed pathogenesis and current treatment options for effective management of children with this novel entity. Electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, WHO, CDC, UK National Health Service, LitCovid, and other databases with unpublished pre-prints) were extensively searched, and all articles on MIS-C published from January 1, 2020, to October 10, 2020, were retrieved. English language studies were included. This systematic review analysed 17 studies with 992 MIS-C patients from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and developed countries (France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Chile and the US CDC data). Fever (95%) was the most common clinical manifestation followed by gastrointestinal (78%), cardiovascular (75.5%), and respiratory system (55.3%) involvement. Laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was present. Though the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, virus-induced post-infective immune dysregulation appears to play a predominant role. Features resembling Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome were present; 49% had shock; 32% had myocarditis; 18% had coronary vessel abnormalities and 9% had congestive cardiac failure. Sixty-three percent of the patients were admitted in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU); 63% received intravenous immunoglobulin, 58% received corticosteroids and 19% received alternate agents like tocilizumab; there were 22 (2.2%) deaths. Only 9/144 children in LMICs received tocilizumab that was significantly less than children in developed countries (p < 0.0001). This systematic review delineates and summarises recently published data on MIS-C from LMICs and developed countries. Although most needed PICU admission and received treatment with IVIG and steroids, most of the patients survived. Significantly fewer patients in developing countries received tocilizumab therapy than those in developed countries. It is crucial for clinician to recognise MIS-C, to differentiate it from other defined inflammatory conditions and initiate early treatment.

AB  - Aim: As coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019-associated pneumonia spreads globally, there has been an urgent need to combat the spread and develop vaccines. Materials & methods: We used an integrated computational algorithm to explore the binding mechanism of TMC-310911/ritonavir (RVT) with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV main proteases. Results: RVT and TMC-310911 had favorable interactions with the proteases, and these high interactions are facilitated by some significant residues such as Asn133, Gly195 and Gln192. Our study further implicated two important rings in the structure of RVT as a possible chemical culprit in its therapeutic activity. Conclusion: Although there are conflicting clinical results on the therapeutic potency of RVT in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019, our findings provided molecular insight into the binding mechanism of TMC-310911 and RVT with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV main proteases.

AB  - This article contextualizes how the antimicrobial properties and antipathogenic contact killing/inactivating performance of copper cold spray surfaces and coatings and can be extended to the COVID-19 pandemic as a preventative measure. Specifically, literature is reviewed in terms of how copper cold spray coatings can be applied to high-touch surfaces in biomedical as well as healthcare settings to prevent fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through rapidly inactivating SARS-CoV-2 virions after contaminating a surface. The relevant literature on copper-based antipathogenic coatings and surfaces are then detailed. Particular attention is then given to the unique microstructurally-mediated pathway of copper ion diffusion associated with copper cold spray coatings that enable fomite inactivation.

AB  - Background: Open data on the locations and services provided by health facilities in some countries have allowed the development of software tools contributing to COVID-19 response. The UN and WHO encourage countries to make health facility location data open, to encourage use and improvement. We provide a summary of open access health facility location data in Africa using re-useable code. We aim to support data analysts developing software tools to address COVID-19 response in individual countries. In Africa there are currently three main sources of such data; 1) direct from national ministries of health, 2) a database for sub-Saharan Africa collated and published by a team from KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme and now hosted by WHO, and 3) The Global Healthsites Mapping Project in collaboration with OpenStreetMap. Methods: We searched for and documented official national facility location data that were openly available. We developed re-useable open-source R code to summarise and visualise facility location data by country from the three sources. This re-useable code is used to provide a web user interface allowing data exploration through maps and plots of facility type. Results: Out of 53 African countries, seven provide an official open facility list that can be downloaded and analysed reproducibly. Considering all three sources, there are over 185,000 health facility locations available for Africa. However, there are differences and overlaps between sources and a lack of data on capacities and service provision. Conclusions: We suggest that these summaries and tools will encourage greater use of existing health facility location data, incentivise further improvements in the provision of those data by national suppliers, and encourage collaboration within wider data communities. The tools are a part of the afrimapr project, actively developing R building blocks to facilitate the use of health data in Africa.

AB  - Vaccines could be the solution to the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. However, some studies have shown that the immunological memory only lasts three months. Thus, it is imperative to develop pharmacological treatments to cope with COVID-19. Here, the in silico approach by molecular docking, dynamic simulations and quantum biochemistry revealed that ACE2-derived peptides strongly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain of spike glycoprotein (S-RBD). ACE2-Dev-PepI, ACE2-Dev-PepII, ACE2-Dev-PepIII and ACE2-Dev-PepIV complexed with S-RBD provoked alterations in the 3D structure of S-RBD, leading to disruption of the correct interaction with the ACE2 receptor, a pivotal step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This wrong interaction between S-RBD and ACE2 could inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in cells, and thus virus replication and the establishment of COVID-19 disease. Therefore, we suggest that ACE2-derived peptides can interfere with recognition of ACE2 in human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Bioinformatic prediction showed that these peptides have no toxicity or allergenic potential. By using ACE2-derived peptides against SARS-CoV-2, this study points to opportunities for further in vivo research on these peptides, seeking to discover new drugs and entirely new perspectives to treat COVID-19.

AB  - Although remote working can involve positive outcomes both for employees and organizations, in the case of the sudden and forced remote working situation that came into place during the COVID-19 crisis there have also been reports of negative aspects, one of which is technostress. In this context of crisis, leadership is crucial in sustainably managing and supporting employees, especially employees with workaholic tendencies who are more prone to developing negative work and health outcomes. However, while research on the role of the positive aspects of leadership during crises does exist, the negative aspects of leadership during the COVID-19 crisis have not yet been studied. The present study aimed to explore the role of authoritarian leadership in a sample of 339 administrative university employees who worked either completely from home or from home and the workplace. The study examined the moderating effect of a manager on this relationship and the connections between workaholism and technostress through conditional process analysis. Results pointed out that high authoritarian leadership had an enhancing effect, whereas low authoritarian leadership had a protective effect on the relationship between workaholism and technostress, only in the group of complete remote workers. Thus, authoritarian leadership should be avoided and training leaders to be aware of its effect appears to be essential. Limitations, future directions for the study, and practical implications are also discussed.

AB  - Due to airborne transmission of infection with the coronavirus, the question arose as to how high the risk of spreading infectious particles can be while playing a wind instrument.To contribute to this question and to help clarify the possible risks, we analyzed 14 wind instruments, first qualitative by making airflows visible while playing and second quantitative by measuring air velocities at three distances (1m, 1.5m and 2m) in direction of the instrument’s bell.Measurements took place with wind instrumentalists of the Bamberg Symphony in their concert hall.Our findings highlight that while playing all wind instruments no airflow escaping from the instruments – from the bell with brass instruments, from the mouthpiece, keyholes and bell with woodwinds – was measured beyond a distance of 1.5m from the instruments’ bell, regardless of volume, pitch or what was played. With that, air velocity while playing corresponded to the usual value of hall-like rooms, of 0.1 m/s. For air-jet woodwinds, alto flute and piccolo, significant air movements were seen close to their mouthpieces, which escaped directly into the room without passing through the instrument and therefore generating directed air movements.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding has been received for this study.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study has been supervised for the ethical guidelines by the Ethics Commission of the University of Freiburg.The Ethics Commission granted the study and waived for any ethical concerns.

AB  - Detailed knowledge about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for uncovering the viral and host factors that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Old-World nonhuman primates recapitulate mild to moderate cases of COVID-19, thereby serving as important pathogenesis models. We compared African green monkeys inoculated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 or irradiated, inactivated virus to study the dynamics of virus replication throughout the respiratory tract. Interestingly, genomic RNA from the animals inoculated with the irradiated virus was found to be highly stable, whereas sub-genomic RNA, an indicator of viral replication, was found to degrade quickly. We combined this information with single-cell RNA sequencing of cells isolated from the lung and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes and developed new analysis methods for unbiased targeting of important cells in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Through detection of reads to the viral genome, we were able to determine that replication of the virus in the lungs appeared to occur mainly in pneumocytes, while macrophages drove the inflammatory response. Interestingly, monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the lungs, rather than tissue resident alveolar macrophages, were most likely to be responsible for phagocytosis of infected cells and cellular debris early in infection, with their roles switching during clearance of infection. Together, our dataset provides a detailed view of the dynamics of virus replication and host responses over the course of mild COVID-19 and serves as a valuable resource to identify therapeutic targets.

AB  - The purpose of this viewpoint is to consider the impact of the current Covid-19 crisis on the educational prospects of young children attending early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings. Studies show that health pandemics and environmental, political, and socio-economic crises jeopardize children's development and education. It is likely that for the immediate future, young children will continue to experience emotional and psychological stress. A curriculum that does not take into consideration a pandemic of the scale we are witnessing today creates unnecessary pressure and anxiety not just on young children but also on the adults who care for and teach them. This article outlines actions to ensure quality education for all as suggested by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The response of ECEC curricula to the pandemic may potentially act as a catalyst for educational change.

AB  - Virus disease spreads effortlessly mechanically or through minute insect vectors that are extremely challenging to avoid. Emergence and reemergence of new viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), H1N1 influenza virus, avian influenza virus, dengue virus, Citrus tristeza virus, and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus have paralyzed the economy of many countries. The cure for major viral diseases is not feasible; however, early detection and surveillance of the disease can obstruct their spread. Therefore, advances in the field of virus diagnosis and the development of new point-of-care testing kits become necessary globally. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) is an emerging technology for gene editing and diagnostics development. Several rapid nucleic acid diagnostic kits have been developed and validated using Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13 proteins. This review summarizes the CRISPR/Cas-based next-generation molecular diagnostic techniques and portability of devices for field-based utilization.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose is to explore triggers for moral distress, constraints preventing physicians from doing the right thing and ensuing consequences in making decisions for patients approaching end of life in intensive care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The qualitative study was undertaken in a tertiary referral intensive care unit in Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. Drawing upon patient case studies of decisions about non escalation and/or withdrawal of life support, we undertook indepth interviews with senior and junior physicians. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and narratively analysed. RESULTS: Eighteen senior and junior physicians involved in 21 patient case studies were interviewed. Analysis determined two predominant themes: key moral distress triggers; and strategies and consequences. Junior residents reported most instances of moral distress, triggered by perceived futility, lack of continuity, protracted decisions and failure to ensure 'good death'. Senior physicians' triggers included constraint of clinical autonomy. Moral distress was far reaching, affecting personal life, working relationships and career choice. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to explore physicians' moral distress in end-of-life decisions in intensive care via a narrative inquiry approach using case studies. Results have implications for the education, recruitment and retention of physicians, relevant in the Covid 19 pandemic.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with adverse effects related both to short-term and long-term exposure. It has also recently been linked to COVID-19 pandemic. To analyze this possible association in Italy, studies on the entire area of the peninsula are necessary, both urban and non-urban areas. Therefore, there is a need for a homogeneous and applicable exposure assessment tool throughout the country.Experiences of high spatio-temporal resolution models for Italian territory already exist for PM estimation, using space-time predictors, satellite data, air quality monitoring data.This work completes the availability of these estimations for the most recent years (2016-2019) and is also applied to nitrogen oxides and ozone. The spatial resolution is 1x1 km.The model confirms its capability of capturing most of PM variability (R2=0.78 and 0.74 for PM10 e PM2.5, respectively), and provides reliable estimates also for ozone (R2=0.76); for NO2 the model performance is lower (R2=0.57). The model estimations were used to calculate the PWE (population-weighted exposure) as the annual mean, weighted on the resident population in each individual cell, which represents the estimation of the Italian population's chronic exposure to air pollution.These estimates are ready to be used in studies on the association between chronic exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 pathology, as well as for investigations on the role of air pollution on the health of the Italian population.

AB  - This report documents the numbers of air evacuations for diagnoses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among U.S. active duty service members (ADSMs) from locations in U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and U.S. European Command (EUCOM) areas of responsibility. Counted were COVID-19 evacuations both within and out of each of the theaters from 11 March through 30 September 2020. Of the 186 evacuations originating in CENTCOM, 185 resulted in the patients arriving at Landstuhl in EUCOM and 1 was within theater. A total of 169 of the CENTCOM evacuations took place in June through August 2020 and only 1 occurred in September. Of the 39 air evacuations originating in EUCOM, 38 were intra-theater transfers and 1 was to a CONUS facility. Most (n=32) of the EUCOM evacuations occurred in September. Evacuees were most often members of the Army (71%), enlisted personnel (63%), males (91%), and aged 30 years or older (58%). Among a random sample of 56 evacuees, 20% were asymptomatic. Among those with symptoms, the most common were cough, fatigue, congestion, headache, and sore throat.

AB  - Either in the form of nature's wrath or a pandemic, catastrophes cause major destructions in societies, thus requiring policy and decisionmakers to take urgent action by evaluating a host of interdependent parameters, and possible scenarios. The primary purpose of this article is to propose a novel risk-based, decision-making methodology capable of unveiling causal relationships between pairs of variables. Motivated by the ongoing global emergency of the coronavirus pandemic, the article elaborates on this powerful quantitative framework drawing on data from the United States at the county level aiming at assisting policy and decision makers in taking timely action amid this emergency. This methodology offers a basis for identifying potential scenarios and consequences of the ongoing 2020 pandemic by drawing on weather variables to examine the causal impact of changing weather on the trend of daily coronavirus cases.

AB  - Measles is a highly contagious disease. A 24 years old patient, recently exposed to measles (unvaccinated), presented in the emergency department with severe agitation, compatible with an acute psychotic episode, during the measles epidemic which spread in Israel in 2018-2019. Upon hospital admission, strict isolation was instructed, yet, without compliance, probably due to the patient's status. Measles diagnosis was promptly confirmed. As measles transmission was eminent, public health measures were employed through immediate implementation of the section 15 of the Public Health Ordinance, allowing for compulsory short-term isolation. The patient's condition improved within a few days and the measures were no longer necessary. This measles case occurred in the pre-Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic when use of a Public Health Ordinance was considered an extreme measure. This is in contrast to the current global use of Public Health laws to enforce strict quarantine and isolation on persons infected or potentially exposed to COVID-19. Nevertheless, minimizing infectious diseases transmission is a core function of public health law. Utilizing legal enforcement in circumstances of immediate public health hazard, such as nosocomial measles transmission, necessitates careful consideration. The integrative clinical and public health approach and prompt measures employed in this exceptional case, led to prevention of further infection spread.

AB  - Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic illustrates the increasingly important role of telemedicine as a method of clinician-patient interaction. However, electronic applications (apps) for the testing of ophthalmology vital signs, such as visual acuity, can be published and used without any verification of accuracy, validity, or reliability. Objective: To reassess the accuracy of visual acuity-testing apps and assess their viability for telehealth. Design, Setting, and Participants: The US Apple App Store was queried for apps for visual acuity testing. Anticipated optotype size for various visual acuity lines were calculated and compared against the actual measured optotype size on 4 different Apple hardware devices. No human participants were part of this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean (SD) errors were calculated per device and across multiple devices. Results: On iPhones, 10 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 109.9%. On the iPads, 9 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 398.1%. Six apps met criteria and worked on both iPhone and iPad, with mean errors from 0.2% to 249.5%. Of the 6 apps that worked across devices, the top 3 most accurate apps were Visual Acuity Charts (mean [SD] error, 0.2% [0.0%]), Kay iSight Test Professional (mean [SD] error, 3.5% [0.7%]), and Smart Optometry (mean [SD] error, 15.9% [4.3%]). None of the apps tested were ideal for telemedicine, because some apps displayed accurate optotype size, while others displayed the same letters on separate devices; no apps exhibited both characteristics. Conclusions and Relevance: Both Visual Acuity Charts and Kay iSight Test Professional had low mean (SD) errors and functionality across all tested devices, but no apps were suitable for telemedicine. This suggests that new and/or improved visual acuity-testing apps are necessary for optimal telemedicine use.

AB  - Social interactions promote the communication of explicit and implicit information between individuals. Implicit or subconscious sharing of cues can be useful in conveying affective states. Knowing the affective state of others can guide future interactions, while an inability to decipher another's affective state is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder. The precise neural circuitry and mechanisms involved in communicating affective states are not well understood. Over the past few years, a number of important observations in rodent models have increased our knowledge of the neural processes for social communication of affective state. Here we highlight these contributions by first describing the rodent models used to investigate social communication of affect and then summarising the neural circuitry and processes implicated by these rodent models. We relate these findings to humans as well as to the current global context where social interactions have been modified by the Covid-19 pandemic.

This challenge runs deeper than one might expect, all the way into how we model the robustness of contemporary phylogenetic inference and taxonomic classifications. Different and legitimate taxonomic assumptions can destabilize the putative objectivity of zoonotic risk assessments, thus potentially supporting inconsistent and overconfident policy decisions.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans that is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the context of COVID-19, several aspects of the relations between psychiatry and the pandemic due to the coronavirus have been described. Some drugs used as antiviral medication have neuropsychiatric side effects, and conversely some psychotropic drugs have antiviral properties. Chlorpromazine (CPZ, Largactil®) is a well-established antipsychotic medication that has recently been proposed to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to 1) inform health care professionals and scientists about the history of CPZ use in psychiatry and its potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 activities 2) inform psychiatrists about its potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, and 3) propose a research protocol for investigating the use of CPZ in the treatment of COVID-19 during the potential second wave. The history of CPZ's discovery and development is described in addition to the review of literature from published studies within the discipline of virology related to CPZ. The early stages of infection with coronavirus are critical events in the course of the viral cycle. In particular, viral entry is the first step in the interaction between the virus and the cell that can initiate, maintain, and spread the infection. The possible mechanism of action of CPZ is related to virus cell entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, CPZ could be useful to treat COVID-19 patients provided that its efficacy is evaluated in adequate and well-conducted clinical trials. Interestingly, clinical trials of very good quality are in progress. However, more information is still needed about the appropriate dosage regimen. In short, CPZ repositioning is defined as a new use beyond the field of psychiatry.

AB  - A pandemic has developed, so physicians worldwide are particularly interested in the experiences of their Chinese Colleagues which are frequently cited. To assess the long-term pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and psychiatric consequences after COVID-19, the outcome of patients included in the early publications and the association with baseline findings is of particular interest. Thus, we review the methods of early Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) publications. Reports published before March 19th 2020, comprising >40 patients were included, considering especially cardiologic aspects. It remains unclear whether patients were described several times, or they were different patients. Only patients with confirmed COVID-19 were described, and no differences in findings of patients with initially suspected and later confirmed, or excluded infection. It remains unclear in how many cases information was missing, since missing values were not reported. Medication before hospital admission, level of education and occupation, household size and composition, weight or body mass index are lacking. No details about electrocardiographic findings are given. Patients still in follow-up, constituting the major part of observations, were excluded. The data should be re-analyzed. A comparison between confirmed and excluded cases could be carried out. By now, in November 2020, the reported patients will most probably have recovered. Thus, it would be possible to differentiate prognostic indicators more precisely. Laboratory tests and electrocardiograms could be analyzed in more detail to shed light on the spectrum of this disease and to solve some of the unanswered questions related with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), diabetes, older age and male gender, which are all risk factors for severe COVID-19.We aimed to study if OSA is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection or for severe COVID-19. METHODS: OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection were extracted from the hospital discharge, causes of death and infectious diseases registries in individuals who participated in the FinnGen study (n=260 405). Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine association. Comorbidities for either COVID-19 or OSA were selected as covariates. We performed a meta-analysis with previous studies. RESULTS: We identified 445 individuals with COVID-19, and 38 (8.5%) of them with OSA of whom 19 out of 91 (20.9%) were hospitalised. OSA associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation independent from age, sex, BMI and comorbidities (p-unadjusted=5.13×10-5, OR-adjusted=2.93 (95% CI 1.02 to 8.39), p-adjusted=0.045). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.25). A meta-analysis of OSA and severe COVID-19 showed association across 15 835 COVID-19 positive controls, and n=1294 patients with OSA with severe COVID-19 (OR=2.37 (95% 1.14 to 4.95), p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Risk for contracting COVID-19 was the same for patients with OSA and those without OSA. In contrast, among COVID-19 positive patients, OSA was associated with higher risk for hospitalisation. Our findings are in line with earlier works and suggest OSA as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pandemics lead to new challenges for healthcare systems and a subsequent shift of the scientific focus, which can partially be seen in alterations in scientific publication activity. OBJECTIVES: Follow-up on the global publication activity within the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a comparison of national contexts with regards to local infection rates and the involvement of the discipline of pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative analysis of the number of publications in the PubMed® database concerning COVID-19 with respect to publication type, date and place of publication, affiliation to an institute of pathology, and correlation with the number of SARS-CoV‑2 infections over the same timeframe. RESULTS: After an initial peak with regards to the number of publications in the months of May and June 2020, a slight decrease was observed, followed by another increase starting in August/September 2020. Further, the time between data collection and publication contracted to approximately 3-4 months. Countries faced with early SARS-CoV‑2 infections published promptly, even though there was no overall association between the number of publications and COVID-19 case numbers. On average, 4% of authors were affiliated to an institute of pathology, with a steady increase of this percentage within the course of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 altered global publication activity by providing for an unprecedented number of publications combined with an acceleration of publication times irrespective of the geographical location and overall case numbers.

AB  - Based on the data of 812 small towns in Chongqing, China, this paper attempts to conduct an empirical analysis on whether tourist towns with excellent natural environment, policy advantage, and market preference are more ecologically livable than ordinary small towns. It is found that as a whole, tourist towns are indeed more ecologically livable than ordinary small towns. Also, from the perspective of grading, both the national and provincial tourist towns have the advantage of ecological livability, but the advantage of national ones is more prominent. Furthermore, the ecological livability of tourist towns is affected by location advantage and policy inclination. The implications of the results are discussed following the outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The suggestions beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 are also provided.

AB  - During global pandemics, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), crisis communication is indispensable in dispelling fears, uncertainty, and unifying individuals worldwide in a collective fight against health threats. Inadequate crisis communication can bring dire personal and economic consequences. Mounting research shows that seemingly endless newsfeeds related to COVID-19 infection and death rates could considerably increase the risk of mental health problems. Unfortunately, media reports that include infodemics regarding the influence of COVID-19 on mental health may be a source of the adverse psychological effects on individuals. Owing partially to insufficient crisis communication practices, media and news organizations across the globe have played minimal roles in battling COVID-19 infodemics. Common refrains include raging QAnon conspiracies, a false and misleading "Chinese virus" narrative, and the use of disinfectants to "cure" COVID-19. With the potential to deteriorate mental health, infodemics fueled by a kaleidoscopic range of misinformation can be dangerous. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research on how to improve crisis communication across media and news organization channels. This paper identifies ways that legacy media reports on COVID-19 and how social media-based infodemics can result in mental health concerns. This paper discusses possible crisis communication solutions that media and news organizations can adopt to mitigate the negative influences of COVID-19 related news on mental health. Emphasizing the need for global media entities to forge a fact-based, person-centered, and collaborative response to COVID-19 reporting, this paper encourages media resources to focus on the core issue of how to slow or stop COVID-19 transmission effectively.

AB  - With COVID-19 N95 shortages, frontline medical personnel are forced to reuse this disposable-but sophisticated-multilayer respirator. Widely used to decontaminate nonporous surfaces, UV-C light has demonstrated germicidal efficacy on porous, non-planar N95 respirators when all surfaces receive ≥1.0 J/cm2 dose. Of utmost importance across disciplines, translation of empirical evidence to implementation relies upon UV-C measurements frequently confounded by radiometer complexities. To enable rigorous on-respirator measurements, we introduce a photochromic indicator dose quantification technique for: (1) UV-C treatment design and (2) in-process UV-C dose validation. While addressing outstanding indicator limitations of qualitative readout and insufficient dynamic range, our methodology establishes that color-changing dosimetry can achieve the necessary accuracy (>90%), uncertainty (<10%), and UV-C specificity (>95%) required for UV-C dose measurements. In a measurement infeasible with radiometers, we observe a striking ~20× dose variation over N95s within one decontamination system. Furthermore, we adapt consumer electronics for accessible quantitative readout and use optical attenuators to extend indicator dynamic range >10× to quantify doses relevant for N95 decontamination. By transforming photochromic indicators into quantitative dosimeters, we illuminate critical considerations for both photochromic indicators themselves and UV-C decontamination processes.

AB  - COVID-19 is deadly to older adults, with research showing that being older and having underlying chronic diseases are significant risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths. However, though similarities exist between both nursing home residents and older community-dwelling people, nursing home residents are substantially more vulnerable to COVID-19. A closer review of both demographic groups provides clarity concerning the difference within the context of COVID-19. Therefore, to address the research gap, drawing insights from Maslow's hierarchy of needs model, this paper aims to examine similarities and differences in COVID-19 risk factors experienced by nursing home residents and community-dwelling older people.

AB  - Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe outbreak and become a global public health priority. Rapid increment of infection number along with significant deaths have placed the virus as a serious threat to human health. Rapid, reliable, and simple diagnostic methods are critically essential for disease control. While Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the current diagnostic gold standard, Reverse Transcriptase LoopMediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) appears as a compelling alternative diagnostic test due to its more simplicity, shorter time to result, and lower cost. This study examined RT-LAMP application for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to RT-PCR assay. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis (2020) was conducted in 6 scientific databases following the PRISMA Guideline. Original published studies on human clinical samples in English were included. Articles evaluated sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP relative to RT-PCR were considered eligible. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was examined based on QUADAS-2. Results A total of 351 studies were found based on the keywords and search queries. 14 eligible case control studies fitted the respective criteria. Quality assessment using QUADAS-2 indicated low risk bias in all included studies. All case studies, comprises 2,112 samples, had the cumulative sensitivity of 95.5% (CI 97.5%=90.8-97.9%) and cumulative specificity of 99.5% (CI 97.5%=97.7-99.9%). Conclusion RT-LAMP assay could be suggested as a reliable alternative COVID-19 diagnostic method with reduced cost and time compared to RT-PCR. RT-LAMP could potentially be utilized during the high-throughput and high-demand critical situations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests and no funding is used in this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This article does not need the IRB approval as it uses publicly available dataAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Recent studies suggested that the fraction of CG dinucleotides (CpG) is severely reduced in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The CpG deficiency was predicted to be the adaptive response of the virus to evade degradation of the viral RNA by the antiviral zinc finger protein that specifically binds to CpG nucleotides. By comparing all representative genomes belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, this study examined the potential time of origin of CpG depletion. The results of this investigation revealed a highly significant correlation between the proportions of CpG nucleotide (CpG content) of the betacoronavirus species and their times of divergence from SARS-CoV-2. Species that are distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 had much higher CpG contents than that of SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, closely related species had low CpG contents that are similar to or slightly higher than that of SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest a systematic and continuous reduction in the CpG content in the SARS-CoV-2 lineage that might have started since the Sarbecovirus + Hibecovirus clade separated from Nobecovirus, which was estimated to be 1213 years ago. This depletion was not found to be mediated by the GC contents of the genomes. Our results also showed that the depletion of CpG occurred at neutral positions of the genome as well as those under selection. The latter is evident from the progressive reduction in the proportion of arginine amino acid (coded by CpG dinucleotides) in the SARS-CoV-2 lineage over time. The results of this study suggest that shedding CpG nucleotides from their genome is a continuing process in this viral lineage, potentially to escape from their host defense mechanisms.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a coronavirus disease characterized by the rapid spread of severe diarrhea among pigs. PED virus (PEDV) infects and replicates mainly in the epithelial cells of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon. Serum or mucosal IgA antibody levels have been used to predict both vaccine efficacy and the level of protective immunity to enteric infectious diseases in individuals or herds. Details of the B-cell immune response upon PEDV infection, such as the systemic and mucosal PEDV IgA antibody response, the distribution of IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and their role in virus clearance are not yet clear. In this experimental infection study, we observed similar fluctuations in PEDV IgA antibody levels in serum and intestinal contents of the upper and lower jejunum and ileum, but not fecal samples, over the 4-week experimental course. ASCs that actively secrete PEDV IgA antibody without in vitro stimulation were distributed mainly in the upper jejunum, whereas memory B cells that showed enhanced PEDV IgA antibody production upon in vitro stimulation were observed in mesenteric lymph nodes and the ileum. Our findings will contribute to the development of effective vaccines and diagnostic methods for PEDV.

AB  - Search and find methods*) such as cluster tracing1)-6) or large-scale PCR testing**) of those who exhibit no symptoms or only mild symptoms of COVID-19 is shown by data analysis to be a powerful means to suppress the spread of COVID-19 instead of, or in addition to, lockdown of the entire population. Here we investigate this issue by analyzing the data from some cities and countries and we establish that search and find method is as powerful as lockdown of a city or a country. Moreover, in contrast to lockdown, it neither causes inconvenience to citizens nor does it disrupt the economy. Generally speaking, it is advisable that both social distancing and increased test numbers be employed to suppress spread of the virus. The product of the total test number with the rate of positive cases is the crucial index.

AB  - Interferon (IFN) responses are central to host defense against coronavirus and other virus infections. Manganese (Mn) is capable of inducing IFN production, but its applications are limited by nonspecific distributions and neurotoxicity. Here, we exploit chemical engineering strategy to fabricate a nanodepot of manganese (nanoMn) based on Mn2+. Compared with free Mn2+, nanoMn enhances cellular uptake and persistent release of Mn2+ in a pH-sensitive manner, thus strengthening IFN response and eliciting broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. Preferentially phagocytosed by macrophages, nanoMn promotes M1 macrophage polarization and recruits monocytes into inflammatory foci, eventually augmenting antiviral immunity and ameliorating coronavirus-induced tissue damage. Besides, nanoMn can also potentiate the development of virus-specific memory T cells and host adaptive immunity through facilitating antigen presentation, suggesting its potential as a vaccine adjuvant. Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations uncover that nanoMn treatment hardly induces neuroinflammation through limiting neuronal accumulation of manganese. Therefore, nanoMn offers a simple, safe, and robust nanoparticle-based strategy against coronavirus.

AB  - The recent pandemic, COVID-19, is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells via ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation and expression patterns of ACE2 may provide valuable insights into tracing the carriers of SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we analyzed the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern among various mammalian species that are close to human beings. We show that mammalian ACE2 gene is deeply conserved at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammals can potentially host SARS-CoV-2. We further report that ACE2 expression in certain human tissues are consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we have built the first atlas of ACE2 expression in various common mammals, which shows that ACE2 expresses in mammalian tissues in a species-specific manner. Most notably, we observe exceptionally high expression of ACE2 in external body parts of cats and dogs, suggesting that these household pet animals could be vulnerable to viral infections and/or may serve as intermediate hosts, thus yielding novel insights into the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The association between changes in public sentiment induced by COVID-19 and green consumption behavior has not been studied deeply. This study proposes that the awe induced by the COVID-19 pandemic can have both negative and positive aspects, aiming to psychologically reveal why the pandemic is affecting green consumer behavior and explore potential pathways for differentiation. Research data were derived from Wuhan, China, and analyzed using experimental method. This study finds that awe of COVID-19 positively affects green consumption behavior. Specifically, due to fear, anxiety, and powerlessness, individuals with negative awe of COVID-19 instinctively need to respond to risk and pay more attention to their own safety and interests, so as to promote green consumption. However, positive awe of COVID-19 involves higher levels of cognition, such as admiration, inspiration, and optimism. It inspires a commitment to prioritize nature and social groups, and promotes green consumption behavior. As conclusions, different types of awe can be induced from public health emergencies like COVID-19 and have their own specific paths to effect green consumption behavior. These findings could help governments and marketers build future policies and strategies to reasonably guide public sentiment in order to better promote green consumption in this epidemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic strained health-care systems throughout the world. For some, available medical resources could not meet the increased demand and rationing was ultimately required. Hospitals and governments often sought to establish triage committees to assist with allocation decisions. However, for institutions operating under crisis standards of care (during times when standards of care must be substantially lowered in the setting of crisis), relying on these committees for rationing decisions was impractical-circumstances were changing too rapidly, occurring in too many diverse locations within hospitals, and the available information for decision making was notably scarce. Furthermore, a utilitarian approach to decision making based on an analysis of outcomes is problematic due to uncertainty regarding outcomes of different therapeutic options. We propose that triage committees could be involved in providing policies and guidance for clinicians to help ensure equity in the application of rationing under crisis standards of care. An approach guided by egalitarian principles, integrated with utilitarian principles, can support physicians at the bedside when they must ration scarce resources.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI), in general, refers to the machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that we associate with our mind, such as "learning" and "solving problem". New biomarkers derived from medical imaging are being discovered and are then fused with non-imaging biomarkers (such as office, laboratory, physiological, genetic, epidemiological, and clinical-based biomarkers) in a big data framework, to develop AI systems. These systems can support risk prediction and monitoring. This perspective narrative shows the powerful methods of AI for tracking cardiovascular risks. We conclude that AI could potentially become an integral part of the COVID-19 disease management system. Countries, large and small, should join hands with the WHO in building biobanks for scientists around the world to build AI-based platforms for tracking the cardiovascular risk assessment during COVID-19 times and long-term follow-up of the survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created multiple challenges for health care, social and economic systems worldwide, but also for school and university teaching. Most learning has been shifted to online classes. So far, it is unclear whether these changes are well received within the student body. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was the evaluation of a newly developed online-based teaching concept for medical students studying radiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The concept consisted of 12 online seminars of the 11-week course "Imaging Procedures", which were combined with 31 prerecorded video presentations. Five weeks after the start of the summer term, we conducted an anonymous online survey, which consisted of 12 questions and a box for additional comments. Furthermore, we analysed the number of requests of the presentations, the duration and the average viewing time. RESULTS: In all, 110 of 213 students (51.6%) completed the survey; 72.7% stated that the new teaching concept drew their interest for radiology, 78.2% agreed that it incited self-study as well as would facilitate time- and place-independent learning (95.5%). The majority indicated that the time investment for the video presentations was appropriate, but shorter video sections would simplify the learning process (70.9%) and the ideal timeframe would be 10-20 min. The majority (80.9%) agreed that the concept should be maintained in upcoming semesters. CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed online-based teaching concept enjoys high acceptance rates among students. It offers advantages such as time- and location-independent learning, possibilities for self-study and should be maintained in upcoming semesters after the end of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Pathogens usurp host pathways to generate a permissive environment for their propagation. The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents the urgent need to understand the complex pathogen-host interplay for effective control of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 reorganizes the host cytoskeleton for efficient cell entry and controls host transcriptional processes to support viral protein translation. The virus also dysregulates innate cellular defenses using various structural and nonstructural proteins. This results in substantial but delayed hyperinflammation alongside a weakened interferon (IFN) response. We provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and its uniquely aggressive life cycle and discuss the interactions of various viral proteins with host signaling pathways. We also address the functional changes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, relative to SARS-CoV. Our comprehensive assessment of host signaling in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis provides some complex yet important strategic clues for the development of novel therapeutics against this rapidly emerging worldwide crisis.

AB  - The world is suffering from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike protein to enter the host cells. Vaccines that introduce the spike protein into our body to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies are currently being developed. In this article, we note that human host cells sensitively respond to the spike protein to elicit cell signaling. Thus, it is important to be aware that the spike protein produced by the new COVID-19 vaccines may also affect the host cells. We should monitor the long-term consequences of these vaccines carefully, especially when they are administered to otherwise healthy individuals. Further investigations on the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on human cells and appropriate experimental animal models are warranted.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that have killed over one million people worldwide so far. To date, over forty million people have officially been identified to be infected with this virus with less than 3% death rate. Since many more people are expected to have been infected with this virus without the official diagnosis, the number of people who have recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 infection should be substantial. Given the large number of people recovered from either the mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe COVID-19 conditions, it is critical to understand the long-term consequences of the infection by this virus. Our histological evaluations revealed that patients died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls, one important hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). By contrast, such pulmonary vascular remodeling lesions were not found in patients died of SARS-CoV-1 during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak or due to the infection by H1N1 influenza. The advancement in the treatment for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been remarkable that HIV-infected individuals now live for a long time, in turn revealing that these individuals become susceptible to developing PAH, a fatal condition. We herein hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 is another virus that is capable to triggering the increased susceptibility of infected individuals to developing PAH in the future. Given the large number of people being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic and that most people recover from severe, mild or asymptomatic conditions, it is imperative to generate scientific information on how the health of recovered individuals may be affected long-term. PAH is one lethal consequence that should be considered and needs to be monitored. This may also foster the research on developing therapeutic agents to prevent PAH, which has not so far been successful.

AB  - To date, seven identified coronaviruses (CoVs) have been found to infect humans; of these, three highly pathogenic variants have emerged in the 21st century. The newest member of this group, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected at the end of 2019 in Hubei province, China. Since then, this novel coronavirus has spread worldwide, causing a pandemic; the respiratory disease caused by the virus is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to mild respiratory tract infections and influenza-like illness to severe disease with accompanying lung injury, multiorgan failure, and death. Although the lungs are believed to be the site at which SARS-CoV-2 replicates, infected patients often report other symptoms, suggesting the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, heart, cardiovascular system, kidneys, and other organs; therefore, the following question arises: is COVID-19 a respiratory or systemic disease? This review aims to summarize existing data on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues in both patients and ex vivo models.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has struck many countries and caused a great number of infected cases and death. Healthcare system across all countries is dealing with the increasing medical, social, and legal issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the standards of care are being altered. Admittedly, neurology units have been influenced greatly since the first days, as aggressive policies adopted by many hospitals caused eventual shut down of numerous neurologic wards. Considering these drastic alterations, traditional ethical principles have to be integrated with state-of-the-art ethical considerations. This review will consider different ethical aspects of care in neurologic patients during COVID-19 and how this challenging situation has affected standards of care in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the Coronaviridae family, is agent of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in early December 2019 and is now considered a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the role of face mask to prevent it. METHODS: A systematic search for English-language literature was done via PUBMED/Medline and Google Scholar up to October 2020. There was two search strategy; for airborne transmission and the role of face mask for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on a fixed and random effects model, the RR and 95% CI were used to evaluate the combined risk. This meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines. RESULTS: After eligibility assessment, four articles with a total of 7688 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The result of this meta-analysis has shown significant reduction in infection with face mask use; the pooled RR (95%CI) was 0.12 [0.06, 0.27] (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that there is association between face mask use and reduction of COVID-19. However, COVID-19 spreads primarily with contact routes and respiratory droplets, but its transmissibility has many mysteries yet and there is controversy about airborne transmission of COVID-19.

AB  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a support modality for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who have failed conventional treatments including low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and neuromuscular blockade. In addition, ECLS can be used for hemodynamic support for patients with cardiogenic shock or following cardiac arrest. Injured patients may also require ECLS support for ARDS and other indications. We review the use of ECLS for ARDS patients, trauma patients, cardiogenic shock patients, and post cardiac arrest patients. We then describe how these principles are applied in the management of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Indications, predictors, procedural considerations, and post-cannulation management strategies are discussed.

AB  - From the 1918 influenza pandemic (H1N1) until the recent 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, no efficient diagnostic tools have been developed for sensitive identification of viral pathogens. Rigorous, early, and accurate detection of viral pathogens is not only linked to preventing transmission but also to timely treatment and monitoring of drug resistance. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the gold standard method for microbiology and virology testing, suffers from both false-negative and false-positive results arising from the detection limit, contamination of samples/templates, exponential DNA amplification, and variation of viral ribonucleic acid sequences within a single individual during the course of the infection. Rapid, sensitive, and label-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 can provide a first line of defense against the current pandemic. A promising technique is non-linear coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, which has the ability to capture rich spatiotemporal structural and functional information at a high acquisition speed in a label-free manner from a biological system. Raman scattering is a process in which the distinctive spectral signatures associated with light-sample interaction provide information on the chemical composition of the sample. In this prospective, we briefly discuss the development and future prospects of CARS for real-time multiplexed label-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens.

AB  - Our evolutionary and structural analyses revealed that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike gene is a complex mosaic resulting from several recombination events. Additionally, the fixation of variants has mainly been driven by purifying selection, suggesting the presence of conserved structural features. Our dynamic simulations identified two main long-range covariant dynamic movements of the novel glycoprotein, and showed that, as a result of the evolutionary duality, they are preserved. The first movement involves the receptor binding domain with the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain 2 and is maintained across human, bat and pangolin coronaviruses. The second is a complex network of long-range dynamics specific to SARS-CoV-2 involving the novel PRRA and the conserved KR*SF cleavage sites, as well as conserved segments in C-terminal domain 3. These movements, essential for host cell binding, are maintained by hinges conserved across human, bat, and pangolin coronaviruses glycoproteins. The hinges, located around Threonine 333 and Proline 527 within the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain 2, represent candidate targets for the future development of novel pan-coronavirus inhibitors. In summary, we show that while recombination created a new configuration that increased the covariant dynamic movements of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein, negative selection preserved its inter-domain structure throughout evolution in different hosts and inter-species transmissions.

AB  - A worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development of new alternatives. We introduce two new disposable box-like head-and-face shields constructed using Japanese origami-style folding. The design comprises a single sheet of thick paper and a shield made of a thin, transparent plastic sheet. The first design, Model 1, is a head-and-face shield designed to cover the wearer's head and neck. Model 2 was designed to solve the problem of heat and moisture buildup inside the shield. This version can be used as face shields for patients, and it allows clinicians to collect swabs from the nasopharynx for virus detection via polymerase chain reaction through pre-cut incisions near the nasal orifices. These two new box-like face shields are excellent alternatives to traditional face shields because of the low cost, compatibility with mass production, lightweight, and disposability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emerging COVID-19 is a severe health crisis worldwide. Wearing a mask was straightforward but shortage of stock and equity of allocation were important issues in Taiwan. Furthermore, increased anxiety leading to stockpiling of masks is common during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to summarize the name-based mask rationing plan implemented in Taiwan and explore the perceived anxiety of mask shortage. METHODS: The government of Taiwan took action to control the supply and allocation of facemasks. We summarize the timeline and important components of mask rationing plan. A simple survey with a 5-point scale questionnaire that aimed to investigate the overall responses to the mask rationing plan was conducted to 44 participants. RESULTS: The mask rationing plan was implemented since late January 2020 and the daily production capacity increased from 2 millions masks to 16 millions in April 2020. People could buy 9 masks in 14 days by verification of national health insurance card. Software applications of face mask availability was demonstrated. Moreover, the mask plan safeguarded the purchase of masks and could result in a decrease in anxiety of mask shortage (4.05 ± 1.15 points, agree or strongly agree: 72.7% participants). And the majority of people felt that the mask plan was satisfactory (4.2±0.92 points, agree or strongly agree: 79.5%). CONCLUSIONS: We found the unique name-based mask rationing plan could control the production, supply of masks, and contribute to the appropriate allocation of masks. It may not only provide physical barriers, but also result in a reduction in the anxiety of mask shortage during the pandemic. CLINICALTRIAL:

AB  - Background: Substances that can be vaped include nicotine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and a range of synthetic drugs called new psychoactive substances (NPS). Due to the rising popularity of vaping among adolescents, it is crucial to understand the relationships between vaping and illicit drug use. Objectives: This paper examined the prevalence and trends of using vaping devices, marijuana vaping, marijuana products, synthetic cannabinoids and mist contents among youth. Methods: The study utilized 5 sets of public cross-sectional national data from the "Monitoring the Future" surveys during 2014-2018. It employed logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: There was an increase from 10.5% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018 for the past 30-day use of vaping devices among 12th graders. Furthermore, there was an increase from 21.6% in 2017 to 34.5% in 2018 for the past 12-month use of marijuana via vaping device among 12th-grade marijuana users. Additionally, there were significant associations between vaping device use and marijuana vaping, between vaping device use and marijuana use, between vaping device use and synthetic cannabinoids use, and between marijuana use and synthetic cannabinoids use from 2016 to 2018. Conclusions: Vaping emerged as another major route of marijuana administration among youth. Adolescent marijuana users had higher odds of using synthetic cannabinoids. This finding highlighted the importance of understanding what adolescent substance consumption pattern would be where marijuana was legalized. It also supported the hypothesis that vaping devices use correlates with, or is associated with, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids use.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been exhausting the entire global economy. As the greatest challenge to sustainable development in all societies and health systems, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and their relevant risk factors are the main causes of illness and death during the 21st century in high, middle, and low-income countries (LMICs). NCDs are also among the main underlying causes of death among COVID-19 patients in many countries. People living with or affected by NCDs (PLWANCDs) are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with COVID-19. Although the ongoing pandemic will be a fundamental game-changer for prioritization and resource allocation in many countries in years to come, ample evidence indicates that NCDs will remain the main killer of people and the costliest barrier to sustainable societies. Looking through the lenses of universal health coverage (UHC), this paper advocates rebuilding our world during COVID-19 aftermath, in a way to harmonize efforts to live with pandemics and make our health systems resilient, balanced, and comprehensive enough to accommodate all threats to humanity, including both communicable and noncommuincable diseases.

Recommendations on how to maintain adequate physical activity, diet, sleep and social connection have been issued. However, it is worth expanding our look to other possible elements related to lifestyles such as the relationship with technology, nature, pets and music. These areas should be included in the assessment and intervention from this perspective. To achieve changes, the values, beliefs, intentions, motivations, risk/benefit balances, capacity for self-regulation, previous history of changes and the person's sense of competence in relation to the possible changes that are being suggested, should be assessed. Individualized and contextualized suggestions that increase the intention of change should be made, avoiding confrontation and generalizations. Although there are still areas of uncertainty in this approach, particularly in relation to dosage and mechanisms of action, its development should be encouraged, given its great potential in terms of cost-effectiveness.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to provide high-level care for a large number of patients with COVID-19 has affected resourcing for, and limited the routine care of, all other conditions. The impact of this health emergency is particularly relevant in the rare connective tissue diseases (rCTDs) communities, as discussed in this Perspective article by the multi-stakeholder European Reference Network on Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ERN ReCONNET). The clinical, organizational and health economic challenges faced by health-care providers, institutions, patients and their families during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have demonstrated the importance of ensuring continuity of care in the management of rCTDs, including adequate diagnostics and monitoring protocols, and highlighted the need for a structured emergency strategy. The vulnerability of patients with rCTDs needs to be taken into account when planning future health policies, in preparation for not only the post-COVID era, but also any possible new health emergencies.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, researchers have been trying to investigate several active compounds found in plants that have the potential to inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study aimed to evaluate bioactive compounds found in plants using a molecular docking approach to inhibit the main protease (Mpro) and spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The evaluation was performed on the docking scores calculated using AutoDock Vina (AV) as a docking engine. A rule of five (Ro5) was calculated to determine whether a compound meets the criteria as an active drug orally in humans. The determination of the docking score was performed by selecting the best conformation of the protein-ligand complex that had the highest affinity (most negative Gibbs' free energy of binding/ΔG). As a comparison, nelfinavir (an antiretroviral drug), chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (antimalarial drugs recommended by the FDA as emergency drugs) were used. The results showed that hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin had better poses than nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as spike glycoprotein inhibitors. Hesperidin, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, and nabiximols had about the same pose as nelfinavir but were better than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as Mpro inhibitors. This finding implied that several natural compounds of plants evaluated in this study showed better binding free energy compared to nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which so far are recommended in the treatment of COVID-19. From quantum chemical DFT calculations, the ascending order of chemical reactivity of selected compounds was pectolinarin > hesperidin > rhoifolin > morin > epigallocatechin gallate. All isolated compounds' C=O regions are preferable for an electrophilic attack, and O-H regions are suitable for a nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, Homo-Lumo and global descriptor values indicated a satisfactory remarkable profile for the selected compounds. As judged by the RO5 and previous study by others, the compounds kaempferol, herbacetin, eugenol, and 6-shogaol have good oral bioavailability, so they are also seen as promising candidates for the development of drugs to treat infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. The present study identified plant-based compounds that can be further investigated in vitro and in vivo as lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - A global response to the rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is imperative in order to reduce mortality and morbidity as well as preventing a country's health system from collapse. Singapore showed exceptional leadership in the containment of the spread of the virus, however through April 2020 the country experienced exponential growth in the number of infections, particularly migrant workers living in dormitories. The following historical case study provides an overview of Singapore's country profile, their healthcare system and the country's non pharmaceutical measures taken to mitigate and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the first few months of the pandemic. We explore the impact COVID-19 had on Singapore's economy at that time and the implications of the resultant social and political disruptions. We conclude our study by using mathematical modelling to explore confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore's local community and those living in dormitories and use this data to forecast the progression of the epidemic in Singapore given the non-pharmaceutical interventions in place at that time. Our results indicate the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore increased 3-fold the initial doubling rate of 22.5 days in the first 2 months of the outbreak to 6.7 days in the 5th month; We note a faster doubling rate of 4.9 days for those living in dormitories compared to a doubling rate of 13.5 days for the rest of the community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The choices that policymakers make are shaped by how their problems are framed. At last, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have risen high on the global policy agenda, but there are many disputed issues. First, what are they? Their name refers not to what they are but what they are not. Second, where do their boundaries lie? What diseases are included? Third, should we view their causes as mainly biomedical, behavioural, or social, or a combination? Our failure to resolve these issues has been invoked as a reason for our limited progress in developing and implementing effective remedies. In this scoping review, we ask "What is known from the existing literature about how NCDs are framed in the global policy discourses?" We answer it by reviewing the frames employed in policy and academic discourses. METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases for articles published since inception to 31 May 2019. We also reviewed websites of eight international organisations to identify global NCDs policies. We extracted data and synthesised findings to identify key thematic frames. RESULTS: We included 36 articles and nine policy documents on global NCDs policies. We identified five discursive domains that have been used and where there are differing perspectives. These are: "Expanding the NCDs frame to include mental health and air pollution"; "NCDs and their determinants"; "A rights-based approach to NCDs"; "Approaches to achieving policy coherence in NCDs globally"; and "NCDs as part of Sustainable Socio-economic Development". We further identified 12 frames within the five discursive domains. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identifies issues that remain unresolved and points to a need for alignment of perspectives among global health policy actors, as well as synergies with those working on mental health, maternal health, and child health. The current COVID-19 pandemic warrants greater consideration of its impact on global NCDs policies. Future global strategies for NCDs need to consider explicitly how NCDs are framed in a changing global health discourse and ensure adequate alignment with implementation and global health issues. There is a need for global strategies to recognise the pertinent role of actors in shaping policy discourses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, numerous research institutions have invested in the development of anti-COVID-19 vaccines and screening for efficacious drugs to manage the virus. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential targets and therapeutic drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 through data mining and bioinformatics. METHODS: We integrated and profoundly analyzed 10 drugs previously assessed to have promising therapeutic potential in COVID-19 management, and have been recommended for clinical trials. To explore the mechanisms by which these drugs may be involved in the treatment of COVID-19, gene-drug interactions were identified using the DGIdb database after which functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and miRNA-gene network construction were performed. We adopted the DGIdb database to explore the candidate drugs for COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 43 genes associated with the 10 potential COVID-19 drugs were identified. Function enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in response to other invasions, toll-like receptor pathways, and they play positive roles in the production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and INF-β. TNF, TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, and CXCL10 were identified as crucial genes in COVID-19. Through the DGIdb database, we predicted 87 molecules as promising druggable molecules for managing COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this work may provide new insights into COVID-19 mechanisms and treatments. Further, the already identified candidate drugs may improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical treatment in this rapidly evolving global situation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited literature exists on CSF findings in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. In this review, we conducted a descriptive analysis of CSF findings in patients with COVID-19 to understand prognosis and explore therapeutic options. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus databases using the keywords "SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid", "SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complications" for reports of CSF findings in COVID-19 related neurological manifestations. Descriptive analysis were conducted to observe the CSF protein and cell counts based on age, gender, severity and fatality of COVID-19, and whether central (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS). RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were identified from 67 studies. Of these, 7 patients (6.2 %) were fatal COVID-19 cases and 35 patients (31%) were considered severe COVID-19 cases. CSF protein was elevated in 100% (7/7) of the fatal cases with an average of 61.28 mg/dl, and in 65.0 % (52/80) in non-fatal cases with an average 56.73 mg/dl. CSF protein levels were elevated in 74.5% (38/51) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 68.6% (24/35) in those with a severe COVID-19 infection. CSF cell count was increased in 43% of fatal cases, 25.7% severe cases and 29.4% of non-severe cases. CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed that the most common CSF picture in COVID-19 infection is elevated protein with very occasionally mild lymphocyte predominant pleiocytosis. Further studies to elucidate pathophysiology of neurological complications in COVID-19 are recommended.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created several challenges for residency programs and prospective interns alike during the upcoming application cycle, including the cancellation of away sub-internships and in-person interviews. Given prior research documenting that applicants' application and ranking decisions are significantly influenced by residency webpages, a potential solution to the loss of in-person experiences during the pandemic is the expansion of residency programs' online presence through their program websites, provision of virtual grand rounds and pseudo-away rotations, and enhancement of virtual interviews. In this editorial, the authors summarize earlier literature querying the content of program websites across fourteen medical specialties, which documented significant gaps in content of interest to applicants. The authors conclude by highlighting several ways to address such gaps in online presence. During an application cycle facing unprecedented resource strain, bolstering the online presence of programs may facilitate an improved fit between programs and future residents.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Wanfang Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were searched from its inception to June 21, 2020. We only included studies that reported clinical symptoms of COVID pneumonia in children. Quality of the included studies was assessed by 2 authors. Pooled results were summarized by STATA 12.0 software.The heterogeneity was measured by I2 tests (I2 < 50 indicates little heterogeneity, I2≥50 indicates high heterogeneity). Publication bias was performed by funnel plot and statistically assessed by Begg test (P > .05 as no publication bias). RESULTS: Results will be shown as figures or tables. CONCLUSION: Our study aims to systematically present the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia patients in children, so as to further provide guidance for clinical management.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2' site(s) is associated with viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane (early pathway) or the endosomal membrane (late pathway), depending on the cell type. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which appears to expand viral tropism to cells with suitable protease and receptor expression. Here, we utilize viral pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 cleavage is essential for early pathway entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for late pathway entry into Vero E6 cells, a model cell line. The S1/S2 cleavage was found to be processed by other proteases beyond furin. Using bioinformatic tools, we also analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related CoVs and offer thoughts on the origin of the insertion of the furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has caused untold disruption and enhanced mortality rates around the world. Understanding the mechanisms for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is key to preventing further spread but there is confusion over the meaning of "airborne" whenever transmission is discussed. Scientific ambivalence originates from evidence published many years ago, which has generated mythological beliefs that obscure current thinking. This article gathers together and explores some of the most commonly held dogmas on airborne transmission in order to stimulate revision of the science in the light of current evidence. Six 'myths' are presented, explained, and ultimately refuted on the basis of recently published papers and expert opinion from previous work related to similar viruses. There is little doubt that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via a range of airborne particle sizes subject to all the usual ventilation parameters and human behaviour. Experts from specialties encompassing aerosol studies, ventilation, engineering, physics, virology and clinical medicine have joined together to present this review, in order to consolidate the evidence for airborne transmission mechanisms and offer justification for modern strategies for prevention and control of Covid-19 in healthcare and community.

AB  - Enteric symptomology seen in early-stage severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-2003 and COVID-19 is evidence of virus replication occurring in the intestine, liver and pancreas. Aberrant lipid metabolism in morbidly obese individuals adversely affects the COVID-19 immune response and increases disease severity. Such observations are in line with the importance of lipid metabolism in COVID-19, and point to the gut as a site for intervention as well as a therapeutic target in treating the disease. Formation of complex lipid membranes and palmitoylation of coronavirus proteins are essential during viral replication and assembly. Inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and restoration of lipid catabolism by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) impede replication of coronaviruses closely related to SARS-coronavirus-2 (CoV-2). In vitro findings and clinical data reveal that the FASN inhibitor, orlistat, and the AMPK activator, metformin, may inhibit coronavirus replication and reduce systemic inflammation to restore immune homeostasis. Such observations, along with the known mechanisms of action for these types of drugs, suggest that targeting fatty acid lipid metabolism could directly inhibit virus replication while positively impacting the patient's response to COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected more than 40 million people worldwide. Some patients had episodes of symptom recurrence after the first episode of infection with variable intervals. There are multiple issues and hypotheses about re-infection or re-activation of the virus, especially in immunocompromised patients. In this paper, we present details of an individual with a recent history of COVID-19 who proceeded to acute myeloid leukaemia M3 and immunosuppression by chemotherapy, then we review some recently published articles about possible re-infection or re-activation.

AB  - Voltage-gated potassium channels are integral membrane proteins selectively permeable for potassium ions and activated upon change of membrane potential. Voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1.3 type were discovered both in plasma membrane and in inner mitochondrial membrane (mito Kv1.3 channels). For some time Kv1.3 channels located both in plasma membrane and in mitochondria are considered as a potentially new molecular target in several pathologies including some cancer disorders. Lipophilic nontoxic organic inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels may potentially find a clinical application to support therapy of some cancer diseases such as breast, pancreas and lung cancer, melanoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Inhibition of T lymphocyte Kv1.3 channels may be also important in treatment of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including severe pulmonary complication in corona virus disease Covid 19, however further studies are needed to confirm this supposition. Statins are small-molecule organic compounds, which are lipophilic and are widely used in treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Electrophysiological studies performed in our laboratory showed that statins: pravastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin are effective inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels in cancer cells of human T cell line Jurkat. We showed that application of the statins in the concentration range from 1.5 μM to 50 μM inhibited the channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was the most potent in case of simvastatin and the least potent in case of pravastatin. The inhibition was partially irreversible in case of simvastatin and fully reversible in case of pravastatin and mevastatin. It was accompanied by a significant acceleration of the current inactivation rate without any significant change of the activation rate. Mechanism of the inhibition is probably complex, including a direct interaction with the channel protein and perturbation of lipid bilayer structure, leading to stabilization of the inactivated state of the channels.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several repurposed drugs have been proposed to alleviate the major health effects of the disease. These drugs are often applied with analgesics or non-steroid anti-inflammatory compounds, and co-morbid patients may also be treated with anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, or antidiabetic agents. Since drug ADME-tox properties may be significantly affected by multispecific transporters, in this study, we examined the interactions of the repurposed drugs with the key human multidrug transporters present in the major tissue barriers and strongly affecting the pharmacokinetics. Our in vitro studies, using a variety of model systems, explored the interactions of the antimalarial agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; the antihelmintic ivermectin; and the proposed antiviral compounds ritonavir, lopinavir, favipiravir, and remdesivir with the ABCB1/Pgp, ABCG2/BCRP, and ABCC1/MRP1 exporters, as well as the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)2B1 and OATP1A2 uptake transporters. The results presented here show numerous pharmacologically relevant transporter interactions and may provide a warning on the potential toxicities of these repurposed drugs, especially in drug combinations at the clinic.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus and thus contains the genetic element s2m. We have extensively mined nucleotide data in GenBank in order to obtain a comprehensive list of s2m sequences both in the four virus families where s2m has previously been described and in other groups of organisms. Surprisingly, there seems to be a xenologue of s2m in a large number of insect species. The function of s2m is unknown, but our data show a very high degree of sequence conservation both in insects and in viruses and that the version of s2m found in SARS-CoV-2 has unique features, not seen in any other virus or insect strains.

AB  - Thousands of articles have been published regarding the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Most of them are not original research articles but reviews and editorials, and therefore, the absence of evidence-based guidelines has been evident. In parallel, the quality of manuscripts is questionable since the number of preprints has increased due to the need of fast publication of COVID-19-related articles. Furthermore, the number of retracted articles during the pandemic is exceptionally high. Media have an important role in the distribution of incorrect information, nevertheless individual people and policy makers are also responsible. As misinformation thrives in crisis periods, well-designed studies are needed to flatten the infodemic curve regarding prevention, diagnosis, and long-term complications of COVID-19.

AB  - Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the vital engine of cellular machinery. After virus entry in host cells the global organization of the viral life cycle is strongly regulated by the formation of virus-host protein interactions. With the advent of high-throughput -omics platforms, the mirage to obtain a "high resolution" view of virus-host interactions has come true. In fact, the rapidly expanding approaches of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics in the study of PPIs provide efficient tools to identify a significant number of potential drug targets. Generation of PPIs maps by affinity purification-MS and by the more recent proximity labeling-MS may help to uncover cellular processes hijacked and/or altered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), providing promising therapeutic targets. The possibility to further validate putative key targets from high-confidence interactions between viral bait and host protein through follow-up MS-based multi-omics experiments offers an unprecedented opportunity in the drug discovery pipeline. In particular, drug repurposing, making use of already existing approved drugs directly targeting these identified and validated host interactors, might shorten the time and reduce the costs in comparison to the traditional drug discovery process. This route might be promising for finding effective antiviral therapeutic options providing a turning point in the fight against the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

AB  - Aim: Present systematic review and meta-analysis examined the burden of psychological reactions predominantly anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia during novel COVID-19 pandemic phase among the frontline healthcare, non-frontline healthcare and general. Methodology: PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS were searched for studies between Jan 1, 2020 to May 25, 2020. Brief protocol of the systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO database, (CRD42020186229).Any study that reported the burden of at least one of psychological reactions including anxiety or depression or stress or insomnia was eligible. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and results were synthesized using random effect meta-analysis. Results: Out of 52eligible studies, 43 reported anxiety, 43 reported depression, 20 reported stress and 11 reported insomnia. Overall prevalence for anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were 26.6%, 26.2%,26.2% and 34.4% respectively. Anxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients (43.3% and 51.75 respectively). Apart from COVID-19 patients, prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were found highest among the frontline healthcare (27.2%, 32.1%,55.6% and 34.4% respectively) as compared to general healthcare workers (26.9%, 15.7%, 7.0% and 34.0% respectively) and general population (25.9%, 25.9%,25.4% and 29.4% respectively). Conclusion: Anxiety and depression were found highest among the COVID-19 patients. Apart from COVID-19 patients, the anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia were more prevalent among frontline healthcare workers compared to general. Such increased prevalence is prompting towards the global mental health emergency. Therefore a call of urgent attention and pan-region effective mental-health intervention are required to mitigate these psychological reactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is not funded by any funding agency.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study involves study level data for meta-analysis and hence exempted from IRB review.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a massive reduction of arthroplasty services due to reallocation of hospital resources. The unique challenge for clinicians has been to define which arthroplasty patients most urgently require surgery. The present study aimed to investigate priority arthroplasty procedures during the pandemic and in the reinstatement period from the surgeon's perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted among members of the European Hip Society (EHS), European Knee Associates (EKA) and other invited orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeons (experts) from across the world. The survey consisted of 17 different arthroplasty procedures/indications of which participants were asked to choose and rank the most important 10. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-nine arthroplasty surgeons from 44 countries responded. The EHS and EKA had a 43% response rate of members. In weighted average points, the majority of respondents (67.5 points) ranked 'acute fractures requiring arthroplasty (Periprosthetic fractures, THA/hemi-arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures)' as priority indication number one, followed by 'first-stage explantations for acute PJI (periprosthetic joint infection)' in second place and priority indication (45.9 points) three as 'one-stage revision for acute PJI' (39.7 points). CONCLUSIONS: There was agreement that femoral neck fractures, periprosthetic fractures, and acute infections should be prioritised and cannot be postponed in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. As arthroplasty procedures are being resumed in most countries now, there has also been a relaxation of lockdown rules in most countries, which might cause a so-called second wave of the pandemic. Therefore, the results of the current study present a proposal by experts as to which operations should be prioritised in the setting of a second wave of the pandemic.

AB  - The advent of COVID-19 has been the occasion for a renewed interest in the principles governing triage when the number of critically ill patients exceeds the healthcare infrastructure's capacity in a given location. Some scholars advocate that it would be morally acceptable in a crisis to withdraw resources like life support and ICU beds from one patient in favor of another, if, in the judgment of medical personnel, the other patient has a significantly better prognosis. The paper examines the arguments for and against this approach from the point of view of natural law theory, especially using the principle of double effect. We conclude that it is inadmissible to withdraw life-saving medical interventions from patients who are still benefiting from them, on the sole grounds that other patients might benefit more. Those who are currently using such technology should only interrupt their treatment if, in the judgment of medical personnel and, if possible, taking into account the wishes and needs of the patient and his family, the treatment is deemed futile, burdensome, or disproportionate.

AB  - Although SARS-CoV-2 is not a proven foodborne pathogen, the COVID-19 pandemic has put the food system on alert. Food safety is identified as an important pillar in mitigating the crisis. Therefore, understanding how popular media are used as a vital disseminator of food safety and health information for public use is more important than ever. YouTube deserves particular attention as one of the most highly trafficked websites on the internet, especially as it has been blamed for spreading misleading or untrustworthy information during the pandemic that contradicts validated information. This study evaluates the food safety information and practices circulated on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic and their alignment with government agencies' recommendations. A search for videos on YouTube was conducted using the keywords "Food and COVID-19," "Food safety and COVID-19," and "Groceries and COVID-19." After applying a series of inclusive and exclusive criteria, a total of 85 different videos from the United States and Canada were evaluated. More than half (59%) of the videos presented handwashing procedures, less than a third (22%) showed kitchen disinfection, and most (69%) showed concern for "take-out" or "grocery store" practices. Multiple and different produce washing procedures were also shown throughout videos. Food was not considered hazardous by 33% of the videos, but 20% mentioned that food packaging is potentially hazardous. Most videos cited government agencies and had a host or guest who was a healthcare professional or professor/expert. Of the overall citations, three videos were not aligned with a government agency's guideline or information cited; two were presented by a healthcare professional. These findings demonstrate the need to develop educational interventions that increase YouTube video hosts and guests' awareness of social media use as a tool for food safety dissemination and the need to provide trustworthy sources.

AB  - Despite being nearly 10 months into the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, the definitive animal host for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causal agent of COVID-19, remains unknown. Unfortunately, similar problems exist for other betacoronaviruses, and no vouchered specimens exist to corroborate host species identification for most of these pathogens. This most basic information is critical to the full understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonotic diseases. To overcome this hurdle, we recommend that host-pathogen researchers adopt vouchering practices and collaborate with natural history collections to permanently archive microbiological samples and host specimens. Vouchered specimens and associated samples provide both repeatability and extension to host-pathogen studies, and using them mobilizes a large workforce (i.e., biodiversity scientists) to assist in pandemic preparedness. We review several well-known examples that successfully integrate host-pathogen research with natural history collections (e.g., yellow fever, hantaviruses, helminths). However, vouchering remains an underutilized practice in such studies. Using an online survey, we assessed vouchering practices used by microbiologists (e.g., bacteriologists, parasitologists, virologists) in host-pathogen research. A much greater number of respondents permanently archive microbiological samples than archive host specimens, and less than half of respondents voucher host specimens from which microbiological samples were lethally collected. To foster collaborations between microbiologists and natural history collections, we provide recommendations for integrating vouchering techniques and archiving of microbiological samples into host-pathogen studies. This integrative approach exemplifies the premise underlying One Health initiatives, providing critical infrastructure for addressing related issues ranging from public health to global climate change and the biodiversity crisis.

AB  - This paper explores how masculinity may help us understand the varying ways political leaders are responding to the coronavirus crisis. By focusing directly on masculinity as a social process, this analysis contributes to the broader literature on gender and leadership, unpacking the gendered double bind that leaders who identify as men must navigate in acknowledging and responding to risks. I examine the responses of Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump suggesting that their respective struggles to acknowledge and respond to the public health threat were not simply the result of a lack of available information to inform rational policy decisions. Acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent rather than 'fight' are not culturally neutral, they are coded as feminine and 'weak'. Clearly, the delay in the response and subsequent spread of the virus in North America was not inevitable, other jurisdictions were able to respond more quickly. The masculinity double bind may have been one of the factors that undermined a prompt response in the increasingly macho context of North America.

AB  - India is an agrarian country with a long history of traditional food processing practices and Short food supply chains (SFSC). However, last few decades saw a huge investment and steady increase in large scale integrated food processing units to combat globalization, food security and India's export demands. Recent outbreak of COVID-19 has manifested the drawbacks in the existing production and supply chain system with a wide range of issues and enforces the need for a more balanced approach. This scenario can be commonly observed in many other agrarian developing nations. This article discusses various issues concerning the existing integrated food processing sectors such as high energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and food insecurity during disasters and pandemic outbreaks. Moreover, we emphasise a more sustainable approach with a better balance and understanding between SFSC and integrated food processing. A potential solution in this scenario would be, rejuvenating SFSC and traditional food processing approaches along with integrated food processing units. An approach of this kind, opens up new possibilities for a next generation process-supply system.

AB  - The global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the environment of urban areas. This study aimed to provide a new insight into the urban transportation and air pollutant emission of representative Canadian cities impacted by this pandemic. The consumption of urban transportation fuel was analyzed and the corresponding CO2 emissions was evaluated. The changes in urban traffic volume and air pollutant concentrations before and after the outbreak of this pandemic was investigated. Due to the lockdown after the outbreak of COVID-19, the domestic consumption of motor gasoline and estimated CO2 emissions from urban vehicles in Canada has continuously decreased with a lowest level in April 2020, and rebounded in May 2020. It will still take a long time to recover to pre-pandemic levels because of the upcoming second wave of pandemic and further change. The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), level of urban congestion and concentration level of NO2 and CO had strong relevance with the COVID-19 period while SO2 did not show significant relation. The comprehensive analysis of changing fuel consumptions, traffic volume and emission levels can help the government assess the impact and make corresponding strategy for such a pandemic in the future.

AB  - Invasion or damage of the male reproductive system is one of the reported outcomes of viral infection. Current studies have documented that SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, can damage the male reproductive system in large part by inflammatory damage caused by cytokine storm. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect the human testis directly and enter semen is controversial. Other adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are also of concern and require comprehensive evaluation. Here, we analyze the invasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 in the testis and examine reported mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interferes with male reproduction. Long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male reproduction are also discussed. It should be emphasized that although COVID-19 may induce testicular damage, substantial decrease in male reproductive capacity awaits clinical evidence. We propose that there is an urgent need to track male COVID-19 patients during their recovery. Development of suitable experimental models, including human reproductive organoids, will be valuable to further investigate viral impact on reproduction for current and future pandemics.

AB  - Some immune system cells express type A and/or type B γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAA-Rs and/or GABAB-Rs). Treatment with GABA, which activates both GABAA-Rs and GABAB-Rs), and/or a GABAA-R-specific agonist inhibits disease progression in mouse models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19. Little is known about the clinical potential of specifically modulating GABAB-Rs. Here, we tested lesogaberan, a peripherally restricted GABAB-R agonist, as an interventive therapy in diabetic NOD mice. Lesogaberan treatment temporarily restored normoglycemia in most newly diabetic NOD mice. Combined treatment with a suboptimal dose of lesogaberan and proinsulin/alum immunization in newly diabetic NOD mice or a low-dose anti-CD3 in severely hyperglycemic NOD mice greatly increased T1D remission rates relative to each monotherapy. Mice receiving combined lesogaberan and anti-CD3 displayed improved glucose tolerance and, unlike mice that received anti-CD3 alone, had some islets with many insulin+ cells, suggesting that lesogaberan helped to rapidly inhibit β-cell destruction. Hence, GABAB-R-specific agonists may provide adjunct therapies for T1D. Finally, the analysis of microarray and RNA-Seq databases suggested that the expression of GABAB-Rs and GABAA-Rs, as well as GABA production/secretion-related genes, may be a more common feature of immune cells than currently recognized.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the world with an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to effectuate herd protection and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report the development of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) from the full-length spike (S) protein that is stable in the prefusion conformation. NVX-CoV2373 S form 27.2-nm nanoparticles that are thermostable and bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. In mice, low-dose NVX-CoV2373 with saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant elicit high titer anti-S IgG that blocks hACE2 receptor binding, neutralize virus, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. NVX-CoV2373 also elicits multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ follicular helper T cells (Tfh), and antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cells in the spleen. In baboons, low-dose levels of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M was also highly immunogenic and elicited high titer anti-S antibodies and functional antibodies that block S-protein binding to hACE2 and neutralize virus infection and antigen-specific T cells. These results support the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix-M (NCT04368988).

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In December 2019, a novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first described and named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although the knowledge base surrounding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 has grown rapidly, significant gaps in our knowledge remain and inaccurate information continues to circulate. This review will discuss the interaction between asthma and COVID-19 to provide a comprehensive understanding based on the currently available published data. RECENT FINDINGS: Non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a significant cause of asthma exacerbations, but SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to exacerbate asthma. Data thus far strongly suggest that patients with asthma are at no increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or more severe disease if infected with COVID-19. Although the data are extremely limited on inhaled corticosteroids and biologic medications, there remain no data suggesting that these therapeutics positively or negatively impact the severity or outcome of COVID-19. SUMMARY: Data are rapidly evolving regarding COVID-19 and asthma. At this time, asthma does not appear to positively or negatively affect outcomes of COVID-19; however, it is imperative that practitioners keep abreast of the changing literature as we await a vaccine and control of this pandemic.

AB  - A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV2 has now spread globally. Replication/transcription machinery of this virus consists of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12 or RdRp) and its two cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 proteins. Hence, RdRp has emerged as a promising target to control COVID-19. In the present study, we are reporting a novel inhibitor VTRM1.1 against the RdRp protein of SARS CoV2. A series of antivirals were tested for binding to the catalytic residues of the active site of RdRp protein. In-silico screening, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, and remdesivir have good interaction with the binding site of the RdRp protein as compared to other antiviral investigated. Hence, ribavirin and remdesivir were used for the denovo fragments based antiviral design. This design, along with docking and MDS analysis, identified a novel inhibitor VTRM1 that has better interaction with RdRp as compared to their parent molecules. Further, to produce a lead-like compound, retrosynthetic analysis, and combinatorial synthesis were performed, which produces 1000 analogs of VTRM1. These analogs were analysed by docking and MDS analysis that identified VTRM1.1 as a possible lead to inhibit RdRp protein. This lead has a good docking score, favourable binding energy and bind at catalytic residues of the active site of RdRp. The VTRM1.1 also interacts with RdRp in the presence of RNA primer and other cofactors. It was also seen that, VTRM1.1 do not have off-target in human. Therefore, the present study suggests a hybrid inhibitor VTRM1.1 for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS CoV2 that may be useful to control infection caused by COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infects its target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, a membrane-bound protein found on the surface of many human cells. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptors blockers (ARB) has been shown to increase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 expression by up to 5-fold. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: These findings coupled with observations of the high prevalence and mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have led to a speculation that ACEIs/ARBs may predispose to higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medrxiv.org preprint server until June 18, 2020. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Ten studies (6 cohorts and 4 case control) that enrolled a total of 23,892 patients and 853,369 controls were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. One study was excluded from the analysis because of high risk of bias. Prior use of ACEIs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease, odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval (0.91-1.05), I2 = 15%. Similarly, prior use of ARBs was not associated with an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2, odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval (0.98-1.10), I2 = 0%. CONCLUSION: Cumulative evidence suggests that prior use of ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 or hospitalization due to COVID-19 disease. Our results provide a reassurance to the public not to discontinue prescribed ACEIs/ARBs because of fear of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare systems worldwide have stepped up their infection prevention and control efforts in order to reduce the spread of the infection. Behaviours, such as hand hygiene, screening and cohorting of patients, and the appropriate use of antibiotics have long been recommended in surgery, but their implementation has often been patchy. METHODS: The current crisis presents an opportunity to learn about how to improve infection prevention and control and surveillance (IPCS) behaviours. The improvements made were mainly informal, quick and stemming from the frontline rather than originating from formal organizational structures. The adaptations made and the expertise acquired have the potential for triggering deeper learning and to create enduring improvements in the routine identification and management of infections relating to surgery. RESULTS: This paper aims to illustrate how adopting a human factors and ergonomics perspective can provide insights into how clinical work systems have been adapted and reconfigured in order to keep patients and staff safe. CONCLUSION: For achieving sustainable change in IPCS practices in surgery during COVID-19 and beyond we need to enhance organizational learning potentials.

AB  - COVID-19 has highlighted the responsibilities of states under the International Health Regulations (IHR), as well as state accountability in case of a breach. These approaches and dimensions are valuable, as many COVID responses have breached human rights. We should also look beyond this crisis and address country preparedness for effective and equitable responses to future infectious disease outbreaks. This paper assesses countries' international legal obligations to be prepared to respond to this and future public health emergencies. It does so from the perspective of the right to health, in interaction with the IHR. We analyze the functional relationship between the right to health and the IHR, focusing in particular on "core obligations" under the right to health and "core capacities" under the IHR. We find considerable parallels between the two regimes and argue in favor of more cross-fertilization between them. This regime interaction may enrich both frameworks from a normative perspective while also enhancing accountability and public health and human rights outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, recovery, and mortality have been identified as critically important core outcomes by more than 9300 patients, health professionals, and the public from 111 countries in the global coronavirus disease 2019 core outcome set initiative. The aim of this project was to establish the core outcome measures for these domains for trials in coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Three online consensus workshops were convened to establish outcome measures for the four core domains of respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, and recovery. SETTING: International. PATIENTS: About 130 participants (patients, public, and health professionals) from 17 countries attended the three workshops. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory failure, assessed by the need for respiratory support based on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale, was considered pragmatic, objective, and with broad applicability to various clinical scenarios. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was recommended for multiple organ failure, because it was routinely used in trials and clinical care, well validated, and feasible. The Modified Medical Research Council measure for shortness of breath, with minor adaptations (recall period of 24 hr to capture daily fluctuations and inclusion of activities to ensure relevance and to capture the extreme severity of shortness of breath in people with coronavirus disease 2019), was regarded as fit for purpose for this indication. The recovery measure was developed de novo and defined as the absence of symptoms, resumption of usual daily activities, and return to the previous state of health prior to the illness, using a 5-point Likert scale, and was endorsed. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 core outcome set recommended core outcome measures have content validity and are considered the most feasible and acceptable among existing measures. Implementation of the core outcome measures in trials in coronavirus disease 2019 will ensure consistency and relevance of the evidence to inform decision-making and care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an avalanche of information, much of it false or misleading. Social media posts with misleading or dangerous opinions and analyses are often amplified by celebrities and social media influencers; these posts have contributed substantially to this avalanche of information. An emerging force in this information infodemic is public physicians, doctors who view a public presence as a large segment of their mission. These physicians bring authority and real-world experience to the COVID-19 discussion. To investigate the role of public physicians, we interviewed a convenience cohort of physicians who have played a role in the infodemic. We asked the physicians about how their roles have changed, how their audience has changed, what role politics plays, and how they address misinformation. The physicians noted increased audience size with an increased focus on the pandemic. Most avoided confronting politics, but others found it unavoidable or that even if they tried to avoide it, it would be brought up by their audience. The physicians felt that confronting and correcting misinformation was a core part of their mission. Public physicians on social media are a new occurrence and are an important part of fighting online misinformation.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Drastic and rapid changes to medical education are uncommon due to regulations and restrictions designed to ensure consistency amongst medical school curriculums and to safeguard student wellbeing. As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical education had to break away from its conventions and transition from time-honored teaching methods to innovative solutions. This paper explores the anticipated and actual efficacy of the swift conversion of a specialty elective from a traditional in-person format to a fully virtual clerkship. In addition, it includes a non-inferiority study to determine where a virtual classroom may excel or fall short in comparison to conventional clinical rotations.

AB  - During air travel, flight crew (flight attendants, pilots) can be exposed to numerous flight-related environmental DNA damaging agents that may be at the root of an excess risk of cancer and other diseases. This already complex mix of exposures is now joined by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The complex exposures experienced during air travel present a challenge to public health research, but also provide an opportunity to consider new strategies for understanding and countering their health effects. In this article, we focus on threats to genomic integrity that occur during air travel and discuss how these threats and our ability to respond to them may influence the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of range of severity of the symptoms. We also discuss how the virus itself may lead to compromised genome integrity. We argue that dauntingly complex public health problems, such as the challenge of protecting flight crews from COVID-19, must be met with interdisciplinary research teams that include epidemiologists, engineers, and mechanistic biologists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of social media assists in the distribution of information about COVID-19 to the general public and health professionals. Alternative-level metrics (Altmetrics) and PlumX metrics are new methods that can assess the amount of sharing and spreading of a scientific article in social media platforms. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize and compare traditional bibliometrics (citation-count and impact factors) with newer metrics (Altmetric Attention Score and PlumX Score) of the top 100 Altmetric scored COVID-19 articles. METHODS: The 100 highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) articles were identified utilizing the Altmetric explorer in May 2020. AAS, journal name, and mentions from various social media databases of each article were collected. Citation-counts and PlumX Weighted Citation Impact scores were collected from the Scopus database. Additionally, AAS, PlumX scores, and citation-counts were log-transformed and adjusted by +1 for linear regression, and Spearman correlation coefficients were utilized to determine correlations. RESULTS: The median AAS, PlumX score, and citation-count were 4922.50, 37.92, and 24.00, respectively. Of 100 articles, New England Journal of Medicine published the most articles at 18% (18/100). Twitter was the most frequently used social media platform with 96.3% of the mentions (985,429/1,022,975). Positive correlations were seen between AAS and citation-count (r2=.0973; P=.002), and PlumX score and citation-count (r2=.8911; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrates that citation-count is weakly correlated with AAS, but strongly correlated with PlumX scores regarding COVID-19 articles at this point in time. Altmetrics and PlumX metrics should be utilized in complement with traditional citation-count when assessing the dissemination and impact of an article regarding COVID-19. CLINICALTRIAL:

AB  - The placenta is a temporary organ that is discarded after birth and is one of the most promising sources of various cells and tissues for use in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, both in experimental and clinical settings. The placenta has unique, intrinsic features because it plays many roles during gestation: it is formed by cells from two individuals (mother and fetus), contributes to the development and growth of an allogeneic fetus, and has two independent and interacting circulatory systems. Different stem and progenitor cell types can be isolated from the different perinatal tissues making them particularly interesting candidates for use in cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The primary source of perinatal stem cells is cord blood. Cord blood has been a well-known source of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells since 1974. Biobanked cord blood has been used to treat different hematological and immunological disorders for over 30 years. Other perinatal tissues that are routinely discarded as medical waste contain non-hematopoietic cells with potential therapeutic value. Indeed, in advanced perinatal cell therapy trials, mesenchymal stromal cells are the most commonly used. Here, we review one by one the different perinatal tissues and the different perinatal stem cells isolated with their phenotypical characteristics and the preclinical uses of these cells in numerous pathologies. An overview of clinical applications of perinatal derived cells is also described with special emphasis on the clinical trials being carried out to treat COVID19 pneumonia. Furthermore, we describe the use of new technologies in the field of perinatal stem cells and the future directions and challenges of this fascinating and rapidly progressing field of perinatal cells and regenerative medicine.

AB  - In the setting of the coronavirus pandemic, medical schools across the world transitioned to a remote learning curriculum with the challenge of developing innovative methods to teach clinical skills. During the pandemic, we designed a 2-week remote clinical skills mini-course for third year medical students. The focus was on clinical reasoning, counseling, and the following the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs): 1 (history and physical exam), 2 (prioritize a differential diagnosis), 3 (recommend and interpret diagnostic tests), and 5 (document a clinical encounter). A multi-modal approach included large and small group virtual case-based discussions, a teaching TeleOSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination), and feedback on patient note skills. Students were asked to self-assess their skills before and after the course based on the core EPAs, counseling skills, and overall preparedness for United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skills exam. Students demonstrated statistically significant increases in mean self-rated scores in all areas except interpreting results of basic studies. They found the teaching TeleOSCE and feedback on their notes the most useful. Future curricula will consider integration of peer-peer remote OSCE practice sessions as well as faculty feedback for individualized learning plans. Lessons learned will be useful for remote structured clinical skills courses in the setting of the pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the global health emergency. Here, we explore the diverse mechanisms of SARS-CoV-induced inflammation. We presume that SARS-CoV-2 likely contributes analogous inflammatory responses. Possible therapeutic mechanisms for reducing SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses comprise FcR inactivation. Currently, there is no specific remedy available against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, recognizing efficacious antiviral leads to combat the virus is crucially desired. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (Mpro also called 3CLpro), which plays an indispensable role in viral replication and transcription, is an interesting target for drug design. This review compiles the latest advances in biological and structural research, along with development of inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros. It is anticipated that inhibitors targeting CoV Mpros could be advanced into wide-spectrum antiviral drugs in case of COVID-19 and other CoV-related diseases. The crystal structural and docking results have shown that Ebselen, N3, TDZD-8 and α-ketoamide (13b) inhibitors can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 Mpro. α-ketoamide-based inhibitor 13b inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu3 lung cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the treatment with Ebselen, TDZD-8 and N3 reduced the amounts of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, 20.3-, 10.19- and 8.4-fold compared to the treatment in the absence of inhibitor. Moreover, repurposing of already present drugs to treat COVID-19 serves as one of the competent and economic therapeutic strategies. Several anti-malarial, anti-HIV and anti-inflammatory drugs as mentioned in Table 2 were found effective for the COVID-19 treatment. Further, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was found more potent than chloroquine (CQ) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Furthermore, convalescent plasma from patients who have recuperated from viral infections can be employed as a therapy without the appearance of severe adverse events. Hence, it might be valuable to examine the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed. Methods: We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10-40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. Results: Combined IgG+IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9% to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6% to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG+IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG+IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 μg/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 μg/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek. Conclusion: We provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.Competing Interest StatementD.R.W. has a financial interest in Quanterix Corporation, a company that develops an ultra-sensitive digital immunoassay platform.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gaining further insights into SARS-CoV-2 routes of infection and the underlying pathobiology of COVID-19 will support the design of rational treatments targeting the life cycle of the virus and/or the adverse effects (e.g., multi-organ collapse) that are triggered by COVID-19-mediated adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or other pathologies. MAIN BODY: COVID-19 is a two-phase disease being marked by (phase 1) increased virus transmission and infection rates due to the wide expression of the main infection-related ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L human genes in tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, as well as by (phase 2) host- and probably sex- and/or age-specific uncontrolled inflammatory immune responses which drive hyper-cytokinemia, aggressive inflammation and (due to broad organotropism of SARS-CoV-2) collateral tissue damage and systemic failure likely because of imbalanced ACE/ANGII/AT1R and ACE2/ANG(1-7)/MASR axes signaling. CONCLUSION: Here we discuss SARS-CoV-2 life cycle and a number of approaches aiming to suppress viral infection rates or propagation; increase virus antigen presentation in order to activate a robust and durable adaptive immune response from the host, and/or mitigate the ARDS-related "cytokine storm" and collateral tissue damage that triggers the severe life-threatening complications of COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 epidemics quickly propagated worldwide, sorting virus genomic variants in newly established propagules of infections. Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries or an actual selective advantage could explain the global high frequency reached by some genomic variants. Using statistical analyses, demographic reconstructions, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the globally invasive G614 spike variant i) underwent a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects nor by overrepresentation in clinical samples; ii) increases the spike S1/S2 furin-like site conformational plasticity (short-range effect), and iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect). Our results support the hypothesis of a selective advantage at the basis of the spread of the G614 variant, which we suggest may be due to structural modification of the spike protein at the S1/S2 proteolytic site, and provides structural information to guide the design of variant-specific drugs.

AB  - The importance of balanced dietary habits, which include appropriate amounts of antioxidants to maintain the immune system, has become increasingly relevant during the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, because viral infections are characterized by high oxidative stress. Furthermore, the measures taken by governments to control the pandemic have led to increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which affect physical and mental health, all of which are influenced by nutritional status, diet, and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet (MD), Atlantic diet (AD), and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds needed to activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses. However, viral pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis entail high oxidative damage caused by both the infection and the resultant social stresses within populations, which increases the probability and severity of infection. Balanced dietary patterns such as the MD and the AD are characterized by the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and whole grains with low intakes of processed foods and red meat. For a healthy lifestyle in young adults, the MD in particular provides the required amount of antioxidants per day for vitamins D (0.3-3.8 μg), E (17.0 mg), C (137.2-269.8 mg), A (1273.3 μg), B-12 (1.5-2.0 μg), and folate (455.1-561.3 μg), the minerals Se (120.0 μg), Zn (11.0 mg), Fe (15.0-18.8 mg), and Mn (5.2-12.5 mg), and polyphenols (1171.00 mg) needed to maintain an active immune response. However, all of these diets are deficient in the recommended amount of vitamin D (20 μg/d). Therefore, vulnerable populations such as elders and obese individuals could benefit from antioxidant supplementation to improve their antioxidant response. Although evidence remains scarce, there is some indication that a healthy diet, along with supplemental antioxidant intake, is beneficial to COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global healthcare emergency. Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiographs and CT chest play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated dataset has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR) collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multi-national expert annotated COVID-19 imaging dataset. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations were performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID positive thoracic CTs. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID data annotation efforts, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics (EUSOMII), the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). Study level COVID classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists with majority vote adjudication by board certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1,000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. We anticipate that the RICORD database will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and healthcare systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many countries aiming to suppress SARS-CoV-2 recommend the use of face masks by the general public. The social meanings attached to masks may influence their use, but remain underinvestigated. METHODS: We systematically searched eight databases for studies containing qualitative data on public mask use during past epidemics, and used meta-ethnography to explore their social meanings. We compared key concepts within and across studies, then jointly wrote a critical synthesis. RESULTS: We found nine studies from China (n=5), Japan (n=1), Mexico (n=1), South Africa (n=1) and the USA (n=1). All studies describing routine mask use during epidemics were from East Asia. Participants identified masks as symbols of solidarity, civic responsibility and an allegiance to science. This effect was amplified by heightened risk perception (eg, during SARS in 2003), and by seeing masks on political leaders and in outdoor public spaces. Masks also acted as containment devices to manage threats to identity at personal and collective levels. In China and Japan, public and corporate campaigns framed routine mask use as individual responsibility for disease prevention in return for state- or corporate-sponsored healthcare access. In most studies, mask use waned as risk perception fell. In contexts where masks were mostly worn by patients with specific diseases (eg, for patients with tuberculosis in South Africa), or when trust in government was low (eg, during H1N1 in Mexico), participants described masks as stigmatising, uncomfortable or oppressive. CONCLUSION: Face masks can take on positive social meanings linked to solidarity and altruism during epidemics. Unfortunately, these positive meanings can fail to take hold when risk perception falls, rules are seen as complex or unfair, and trust in government is low. At such times, ensuring continued use is likely to require additional efforts to promote locally appropriate positive social meanings, simplifying rules for use and ensuring fair enforcement.

AB  - Increased risk of cardiovascular complications during and post-COVID-19 infection is more and more recognized-including myocarditis, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarctions (MIs). The mechanisms leading to these complications are direct virus-induced injuries, as well as potential thrombotic and inflammatory-induced mechanisms. To the latter, inflammatory plaque instability and plaque rupture are discussed entities contributing to MI-induced post-COVID-19 complications. Our case report describes the first time, when a temporary impairment of LVEF in the COVID-19-convalescence phase unmasks a silent MI due to coronary plaque rupture by using invasive (OCT) and non-invasive (CMR) modalities. Myocardial infarction might be an important differential diagnosis to consider in deteriorating patients with COVID-19, especially if dyspnoea persists after acute infection.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets/aerosols and it causes COVID-19. The virus infects epithelial cells by using the spike protein on its surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the cells. Thus, candidate vaccines targeting the spike protein are currently being developed to prevent against infections. Approximately 44 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials (phase I-III) and an additional 164 candidates are in preclinical stages. The efficacy data from phase I/II trials of lead candidate vaccines look very promising with virus-neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers in the range of 16.6-3906. Most recently, two SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been granted the first emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S.; BNT162b2 has also been granted an EUA in the United Kingdom, Canada, and in the European Union. This review assesses whether SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines (with approved EUA or in phase III trials) meet the criteria for an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The review concludes with expectations from phase III trials and recommendations for phase IV studies (post-vaccine approval).

AB  - We aim to investigate the factors enabling the accurate implementation of the patient-assisted teledermatology model during the pandemic in our country. This single-center, a prospective-survey study was enrolled consecutively 468 patients aged 13 years and older. The patients were asked about their attitudes towards teledermatology. After the dermatological examinations, the diagnosis and management of the diseases, and classification of diseases according to lesion locations were recorded. The physician's and the patient's opinions on whether it was possible to manage properly the current medical condition through teledermatology were recorded. The patients stated that 81.2% have been keen to use teledermatology for any complaints during the pandemic. 53.7% of the patients who are positive to use teledermatology expressed that they would never use this method unless it is fully reimbursed. Although it was thought that 49.8% of the current complaints according to the patients and 56.6% to the dermatologists could be resolved appropriately by teledermatology, for 24.8% either the patient's or the physician's opinion was contrary. Being woman, high-income level, and the presence of facial dermatosis favorably affected the patients' and physicians' evaluations regarding the suitability of the complaint to teledermatology. Factors such as low education level, insufficient technical skills to be examined alone, and the necessity of undressing for examination caused patients to consider teledermatology unsuitable for their current complaints. Priority should be given to the development of an appropriate reimbursement system and reducing potential medicolegal risks to encourage patients to participate in high-quality teledermatology.

AB  - Healthy eating is an important issue affecting a large part of the world population, so human diets are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the devastating consequences of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19). A realistic and sustainable diet plan can help us to have a healthy eating habit since it considers most of the expectations from a diet without any restriction. In this study, the classical diet problem has been extended in terms of modelling, data sets and solution approach. Inspired by animals' hunting strategies, it was re-modelled as a many-objective optimisation problem. In order to have realistic and applicable diet plans, cooked dishes are used. A well-known many-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the diet problem. Results show that our approach can optimise specialised daily menus for different user types, depending on their preferences, age, gender and body index. Our approach can be easily adapted for users with health issues by adding new constraints and objectives. Our approach can be used individually or by dietitians as a decision support mechanism.

AB  - Though it has been 8 months since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, number of cases and deaths are still seriously increasing. We still don't have enough evidence about the prognosis of patients who had COVID-19 pneumonia. In long term follow up we wonder if they will have rapid FVC decline, widespread fibrosis in computed tomography, loss in quality of life or increased mortality that we experience in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia or autoimmune interstitial lung diseases. However, in elderly patients less severe dysfunction or non-progressive-fibrosis can cause morbidity and mortality. Therefore, if we consider millions of people who are affected by COVID-19, even a rare complication can cause serious health problem in social scale. Because of the importance of this issue randomized controlled trials should be rapidly planned on post-COVID fibrosis, COVID associated thrombosis, risk factors, prevention and treatment (1). In this review, the frequency, clinical importance, prevention and treatment of possible long-term sequels of COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension) will be discussed.

AB  - The present study investigates the air pollution pattern over India during the COVID-19 lockdown period (24 March-31 May 2020), pre-lockdown (1-23 March 2020) and the same periods from 2019 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra aerosol optical depth (AOD) with level 2 (10 km × 10 km) and level 3 (1° × 1° gridded) collection 6.1 Dark Target Deep Blue (DT-DB) aerosol product the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 and SO2 data with a spatial resolution of 7 km × 3.5 km. We also use long-term average (2000-2017) of AOD for March-May to identify existing hotspot regions and to compare the variations observed in 2019 and 2020. The aim of the present work is to identify the pollution hotspot regions in India that existed during the lockdown and understanding the future projection scenarios reported by previous studies in light of the present findings. We have incorporated Menn-Kendall trend analysis to understand the AOD trends over India and percentage change in AOD, NO2 and SO2 to identify air pollution pattern changes during the lockdown. The results indicate higher air pollution levels over eastern India over the coal-fired power plants clusters. By considering the earlier projected studies, our results suggest that eastern India will have higher levels of air pollution, making it a new hotspot region for air pollution with highest magnitudes.

AB  - Coagulation activation has been reported in several cohorts of patients Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the true burden of systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 remains unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database to identify studies that reported the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy using established criteria in patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] and/or sepsis-induced coagulopathy [SIC]). Pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using random-effects model. A total of 5 studies including 1210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of systemic coagulopathy was 7.1% (95%CI: 3.2%,15.3%, I2 = 93%). The pooled prevalence of DIC (N = 721) and SIC (N = 639) were 4.3% (95%CI 1.7%, 10.4%, I2 = 84%) and 16.2% (95%CI: 9.3%, 26.8%, I2 = 74%), respectively. Only 2 studies reported the prevalence of elevated D-dimer levels with the pooled prevalence of 84.6% (95%CI: 52.0%,96.5%, I2 = 94%). Average D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were remarkably increased, while platelet counts, PT, and aPTT ratios were minimally affected in COVID-19. The estimated prevalence of systemic coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 was low despite D-dimer elevation in most patients. Relatively low systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 may contribute to the high incidence of thrombosis rather than bleeding in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The aberrant expression level of SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene ACE2 was reported in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) comorbidity of COVID-19. However, the association of ACE2 expression levels with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming in LUAD remains lacking. We investigated the expression level of ACE2, an association of ACE2 expression level with various types of immune signatures, immune ratios, and pathways. We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package to identify the gene modules and investigated prognostic roles of hub genes in LUAD. Overexpression of ACE2 level was found in LUAD and ACE2 expression was negatively associated with various types of immune signatures including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ regulatory T cells, NK cells, and T cell activation. Besides, ACE2 upregulation was not only associated with CD8+ T cell/CD4+ regulatory T cell ratios but also linked with downregulation of immune-markers including CD8A, KLRC1, GZMA, GZMB, NKG7, CCL4, and IFNG. Moreover, the ACE2 expression level was found to be associated with the enrichment level of various metabolic pathways and it was also found that the metabolic pathways are directly positively correlated with the increased expression levels of ACE2, indicating that the overexpression of ACE2 is associated with metabolic reprogramming in LUAD. Furthermore, WGCNA based analysis revealed the gene modules in the high-ACE2-expression-level group of LUAD and identified GCLC and SLC7A11 hub genes which are not only highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma but also correlated with the poor survival prognosis. Our analysis of ACE2 in LUAD tissues suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also associated with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming. This study underlines the clue for understanding the clinical significance of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients with LUAD comorbidity.

AB  - Basing on scientific evidence and discussions with many people about COVID-19, an outline of the Three Cs Strategy is presented as an alternative to lockdown. The suggested solutions - eg encouraging regular physical activity outdoors (also for symptomless quarantined people), frequent ventilation with fresh air, and more careful use of antipyretics - can markedly help to reduce the rate of transmission of this disease. The new strategy is also likely to lower the risk of mental disorders and various diseases, thanks to promotion of a healthy lifestyle. The outline should be discussed and refined in the future, to improve public health worldwide.

AB  - An ongoing pandemic, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening the nations of the world regardless of health infrastructure conditions. In the age of digital electronic information and telecommunication technology, scalable telehealth services are gaining immense importance by helping to maintain social distances while providing necessary healthcare services. This paper aims to review the various types of scalable telehealth services used to support patients infected by COVID-19 and other diseases during this pandemic. Recently published research papers collected from various sources such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases using the terms "Telehealth", "Coronavirus", "Scalable" and "COVID-19" are reviewed. The input data and relevant reports for the analysis and assessment of the various aspects of telehealth technology in the COVID-19 pandemic are taken from official websites. We described the available telehealth systems based on their communication media such as mobile networks, social media, and software based models throughout the review. A comparative analysis among the reviewed systems along with necessary challenges and possible future directions are also drawn for the proper selection of affordable technologies. The usage of scalable telehealth systems improves the quality of the healthcare system and also reduces the infection rate while keeping both patients and doctors safe during the pandemic.

AB  - Objectives: Over the years, Azadirachta indica, Mangifera indica, and Moringa oleifera have been shown to possess some antiviral characteristics. This study applies molecular docking techniques to assess inhibitory effects of some bioactive compounds from the plants mentioned above against the main protease (Mpro), a key protein involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles for screened compounds were predicted in silico. Methods: The crystal structure of Mpro was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, while the plant bioactive compounds were retrieved from Pubchem. Drug-likeness of the selected compounds and a control drug (hydroxychloroquine) were assessed, and the compounds that satisfied the drug-likeness rule were docked against Mpro. The docked complexes were analyzed using LigPlot and the protein-ligand profiler server. The top five compound hits were subjected to ADMET screening using the ADMETSar server. Results: A total of 17 out of 22 screened compounds passed Lipinski's assessment. Additionally, the most active compounds from the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro compared with hydroxychloroquine, which alludes to their possible involvement in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease replication process. Conclusions: In our study, most of the active phytocomponents of the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and preferred pharmacological features when compared with hydroxychloroquine. These findings indicate these compounds are potentially antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading across the globe, so the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents is urgently needed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a human receptor that facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2, serves as a prominent target for drug discovery. In the present study, we have applied the bioinformatics approach for screening of a series of bioactive chemical compounds from Himalayan stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) as potent inhibitors of ACE-2 receptor (PDB ID: 1R4L). The molecular docking was applied to dock a set of representative compounds within the active site region of target receptor protein using 0.8 version of the PyRx virtual screen tool and analyzed by using discovery studio visualizer. Based on the highest binding affinity, 23 compounds were shortlisted as a lead molecule using molecular docking analysis. Among them, β-sitosterol was found with the highest binding affinity - 12.2 kcal/mol and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of the ACE-2 receptor. Similarly, luteoxanthin and violaxanthin followed by rutin also displayed stronger binding efficiency. We propose these compounds as potential lead candidates for the development of target-specific therapeutic drugs against COVID-19.

AB  - AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spate of studies showing a close connection between inequitable access to health care, welfare services and adverse outcomes from the pandemic. Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently, diabetes mellitus (DM) as well as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are major public health issues worldwide. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that patients with DM are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suffer from more severe forms of the disease. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Google search engines. RESULTS: Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in the human host. The differential expression of ACE2 in the lungs of patients with DM makes them more susceptible to COVID-19. Additionally, acute or chronic hyperglycemia renders individuals in an immune-suppressive state, with impaired innate and adaptive immunity function, contributing also to the severity of COVID-19 infection among patients with DM. Other factors contributing to a more severe course of COVID-19 include the co-existence of obesity in T2DM; the endothelial inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which aggravates the endothelial dysfunction observed in both T1DM and T2DM; and the hypercoagulability presented in COVID-19 infection that increases the thrombotic tendency in DM. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the co-existence of both pandemics as well as the current recommendations and future perspectives regarding optimal treatment of inpatients and outpatients with DM in the era of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the current recommended drugs for the treatment of severe COVID-19, dexamethasone and remdesivir, may cause hyperglycemia, an adverse effect that physicians should bear in mind, when caring for patients with DM and COVID-19.

AB  - In 2020, due to the Nightingale year and COVID-19 crisis, nursing is in the public eye more than ever. Nurses often are being seen as compassionate helpers. The public image of nursing, however, also consists of stereotypes such as nursing being a 'doing' profession and care being a 'female' characteristic. Next to that, nursing is associated with images from the past, such as 'the lady with the lamp'. Therefore, in the public eye at least, the nursing identity seems a simple and straightforward enough construct, but nothing less is true. Looking at what a professional identity consists of, historic and social developments influence a group identity as a construct. In addition, individual, professional and contemporary societal moralities, including stereotypes, play its role. Nurses themselves reinforce stereotypes in order to fit into what is expected, even when they believe professional behaviour encompasses other features. They may do so individually as well as in a group context. But nursing actually seems to be better off when viewed upon as a diverse, autonomous profession. Moral values such as compassion motivate nurses to enter the profession. Research shows that if such values are addressed in daily practice, nursing could perhaps be saved from nurses leaving the profession because of feeling unfulfilled. Another aspect concerns the huge nursing body of knowledge. If seen as the ground on which nursing behaviour is standing, it would contribute to a different image of nursing than simplified stereotypes, which do not acknowledge the complex nature of the profession. This paper challenges the idea that the nursing identity is unchangeable and the notion that 'a nurse will always be a nurse'. By doing so, the paper contributes to a debate on the supposed 'true' nature of the nursing identity and opens a discussion on the need for it to change.

AB  - Background: There is a trend towards decentralisation of laboratory tests by means of Point-of-Care testing (POCT). Within hospitals, Belgian law requires a POCT policy, coordinated by the clinical laboratory. There is however no legal framework for POCT performed outside the hospital: no reimbursement, no compulsory quality monitoring and no limits nor control on the prices charged to the patient. Uncontrolled use of POCT can have negative consequences for individual and public health. Proposal: We propose that POCT outside hospitals would only be reimbursed for tests carried out within a legal framework, requiring evidence-based testing and collaboration with a clinical laboratory, because clinical laboratories have procedures for test validation and quality monitoring, are equipped for electronic data transfer, are familiar with logistical processes, can provide support when technical issues arise and can organise and certify training. Under these conditions the government investment will be offset by health benefits, e.g. fall in antibiotic consumption with POCT for CRP in primary care, quick response to SARS-CoV2-positive cases in COVID-19 triage centres. Priorities:1° extension of the Belgian decree on certification of clinical laboratories to decentralised tests in primary care; 2° introduction of a separate reimbursement category for POCT; 3° introduction of reimbursement for a limited number of specified POCT; 4° setup of a Multidisciplinary POCT Advisory Council, the purpose of which is to draw up a model for reimbursement of POCT, to select tests eligible for reimbursement and to make proposals to the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI).

AB  - Restricted human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic raised global attention to the presence of wildlife in cities. Here, we analyzed iNaturalist observations of prominent wildlife species around North-American urban centers, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We suggest that the popular notion of 'wildlife reclaiming cities' may have been exaggerated. We found that while pumas ventured deeper into urban habitats during the COVID-19 pandemic, bears, bobcats, coyotes, and moose did not. Species differential behavioral responses may highlight their evolutionary history cohabiting human habitats. Nevertheless, our results highlight the importance of urban nature for people during the pandemic. Our insights could help manage urban wildlife, better plan greenspaces, and promote positive nature engagements.

AB  - Emergency surgical treatment has been challenging and the risk of blood contamination has been high, which is a concern among the medical and dental fraternity. The risk outweighs the benefits in these unprecedented times if proper screening and inactivation of blood products are not performed. Pathogen reduction technologies incorporate various modalities for the inactivation of blood products mainly related to blood transfusion. Oral surgical procedures and periodontal surgeries use platelet-rich fibrin for various regenerative procedures that amplify the prognosis positively. The use of blood products for various treatments could result in contamination, a factor which should be significant attention. The objective of this study was to review the role of pathogen reduction technology in inactivating pathogens in blood products and its use in oral and periodontal surgical procedures. The literature presented in the study is from original studies from a period of 2000 to 2020 which was sourced from Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane central databases. Relevant published papers and in-press papers that provided information were identified and selected. The studies presented have shown data related to implementation of pathogen reduction technologies in relation to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and its possible implementation in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The paper reviews the various technologies offered and the possibility to eradicate pathogens found in routine blood products, used in oral and periodontal surgical procedures. In all probability, the use of pathogen reduction technology might offer a ray of light to contain the spread among dental treatment procedures.

AB  - A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to genus beta-coronavirus has been associated with an acute respiratory disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of September 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had caused 867,219 fatalities in 188 nations across the globe. Rapid progression to bronchopneumonia manifesting with severe hypoxemia and eventual evolution into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating mechanical ventilation is the hallmark of this disease. The novel nature of COVID-19 pneumonia and the high morbidity and mortality associated with the same has vexed the critical care community. A cultural shift away from evidence-based medicine, and the impetus to attempt newer unproven therapies like awake proning, interleukin receptor 6 antagonists, inhaled nitric oxide, empiric anticoagulation etc. over modalities that have been tested over the decades is slowly gaining ground. The suggestions to delay intubations and liberalize tidal volumes have polarized the medical field like never before. The lack of consistency in management practices and establishing practices based on anecdotes and experiences can lead to devastating outcomes in the patients affected by this deadly virus. In this narrative review, we attempt to re-emphasize the need for an evidence-based approach to the management of COVID-19 related ARDS and review treatment strategies that have been established after rigorous trials and have stood the test of time.

AB  - Coagulopathy has recently been recognized as a recurring complication of COVID-19, most typically associated with critical illness. There are epidemiological, mechanistic and transcriptomic evidence that link Selenium with SARS-CoV-2's intracellular latency. Taking into consideration the vital role of selenoproteins in maintaining an adequate immune response, endothelial homeostasis and a non-prothrombotic platelet activation status, we propose that impairment in selenocysteine synthesis, via perturbations in the aforementioned physiological functions, potentially constitutes a mechanism of coagulopathy in COVID 19 patients other than those developed in critical illness.

AB  - This paper introduces the model of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. In modern Western medicine, during non-crisis times, principlism provides the four guiding principles in biomedical ethics-autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice; autonomy typically emerges as the decisive principle. The physician-patient relationship is a deontological construct in which the physician's primary duty is to the individual patient and the individual patient is paramount. For this reason, we term the non-crisis ethical framework that guides modern medicine Deontological Principlism. During times of crisis, resources become scarce, standards of care become dynamic, and public health ethics move to the forefront. Healthcare providers are forced to work in non-ideal conditions, and interactions with individual patients must be considered in the context of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare to shift to a more utilitarian framework with a greater focus on promoting the health of communities and populations. This paper puts forth the notion of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. We discuss each of the four principles from a utilitarian perspective and use clinical vignettes, based on real cases from the COVID-19 pandemic, for illustrative purposes. We explore how Deontological Principlism and Utilitarian Principlism are two ends of a spectrum, and the implications to healthcare as we emerge from the pandemic.

AB  - Social Media usage has been shown to increase in situations of natural disaster and other crises. It is crucial for the scientific community to understand how social media works in order to enhance our capabilities and make a more resilient community. Through social media communication, the scientific community can collaborate around the globe in a faster way the most important findings of a disease, with a decreased knowledge transition time to other healthcare providers (HCPs). This is greatly important to coordinate research and knowledge during a time of uncertainty and protentional fake news. During the 2020 global pandemic, social media has become an ally but also a potential threat. High volumes of information compressed into a short period can result in overwhelmed HCPs trying to discern fact from noise. A major limitation of social media currently is the ability to quickly disseminate false information which can confuse and distract. Society relies on educated scientists and physicians to be leaders in delivering fact-based information to the public. For this reason, in times of crises it is important to be leaders in the conversation of social media to guide correct and helpful information and knowledge to the masses looking for answers.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has exacted an enormous toll on healthcare systems worldwide. The cytokine storm that follows pulmonary infection is causally linked to respiratory compromise and mortality in the majority of patients. The sparsity of viable treatment options for this viral infection and the sequelae of pulmonary complications have fueled the quest for new therapeutic considerations. One such option, the long-forgotten idea of using low-dose radiation therapy, has recently found renewed interest in many academic centers. We outline the scientific and logistical rationale for consideration of this option and the mechanistic underpinnings of any potential therapeutic value, particularly as viewed from an immunological perspective. We also discuss the preliminary and/or published results of prospective trials examining low-dose radiation therapy for COVID-19.

AB  - Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) responsible for viral pneumonia which emerged in late 2019 has badly affected the world. No clinically proven drugs are available yet as the targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease. The viral main protease which helps in replication and transcription inside the host can be an effective drug target. In the present study, we aimed to discover the potential of β-adrenoceptor agonists and adenosine deaminase inhibitors which are used in asthma and cancer/inflammatory disorders, respectively, as repurposing drugs against protease inhibitor by ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening using COVID-19 protease-N3 complex. The AARRR pharmacophore model was used to screen a set of 22,621 molecules to obtain hits, which were subjected to high-throughput virtual screening. Extra precision docking identified four top-scored molecules such as +/--fenoterol, FR236913 and FR230513 with lower binding energy from both categories. Docking identified three major hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Glu166 and Gln189 residues. 100 ns MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, molecular mechanism and energy requirements. MM/PBSA energy calculation suggested that van der Waals and electrostatic energy components are the main reasons for the stability of complexes. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between protein-ligand and flexibility of the ligand are found to be responsible for providing extra stability to the complexes. The insights gained from this combinatorial approach can be used to design more potent and bio-available protease inhibitors against novel coronavirus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - When initial reports emerged in early 2020 that people in the United States were testing positive for the novel coronavirus, physiatrists began to worry about the effects it could have on persons with disabilities and health disparities. To date, little has been reported on the intersectionality between disability, race and ethnicity and its effect on the health and healthcare of affected people. With widespread use and forced adoption of telemedicine to serve their rehabilitative healthcare needs during this pandemic, this novel information on the intersection of two vulnerable and inter-related populations that have been overlooked during COVID-19, is of major health importance.

AB  - The rapidly growing body of structural and biochemical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has revealed a variety of distinct functional states with radically different arrangements of the receptor-binding domain, highlighting a remarkable function-driven conformational plasticity and adaptability of the spike proteins. In this study, we examined molecular mechanisms underlying conformational and dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike mutant trimers through the lens of dynamic analysis of allosteric interaction networks and atomistic modeling of signal transmission. Using an integrated approach that combined coarse-grained molecular simulations, protein stability analysis, and perturbation-based modeling of residue interaction networks, we examined how mutations in the regulatory regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can differentially affect dynamics and allosteric signaling in distinct functional states. The results of this study revealed key functional regions and regulatory centers that govern collective dynamics, allosteric interactions, and control signal transmission in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We found that the experimentally confirmed regulatory hotspots that dictate dynamic switching between conformational states of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein correspond to the key hinge sites and global mediating centers of the allosteric interaction networks. The results of this study provide a novel insight into allosteric regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins showing that mutations at the key regulatory positions can differentially modulate distribution of states and determine topography of signal communication pathways operating through state-specific cascades of control switch points. This analysis provides a plausible strategy for allosteric probing of the conformational equilibrium and therapeutic intervention by targeting specific hotspots of allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.

Intending biological activities and SAR we propose replacements of fluorine, methyl and methoxy of synthetic compounds for noteworthy antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer and anti-tuberculosis activities. Among these compounds 3a, 4a and 5e were progressively strong against E. coli and K. pneumonia. Whereas, compounds 4a, 5a and 6a with addition of various functional groups (OCH3, CH3) were excellent against S. aureus and B. subtilis. Compound 5c exhibited strong RSA and dynamic ferrous ion (Fe2+) metal chelating impact with IC50 of 7.88 ± 0.93 and 4.06 ± 0.31 µg/mL, respectively. Compound 5e was considerably cytotoxic against all cancer cells displaying activity better than the standard drug. Compounds 6b and 6e inhibited M. tuberculosis (MIC 1.0 mg/L) considerably. Molecular docking studies indicate that compounds 4d, 5a, 5b, 6b and 6f exhibited good interactions with 6LZE (COVID-19) and 6XFN (SARS-CoV-2) at active sites. The structure of the synthesized compounds were elementally analyzed using IR, 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectral information.

AB  - The innate immune response is nonspecific and constitutes the first line of defense against infections by pathogens, mainly by enabling their elimination by phagocytosis or apoptosis. In immune cells, this response is characterized, amongst others, by the synthesis of restriction factors, a class of proteins whose role is to inhibit viral replication. Among them, the proteins of the APOBEC3 (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide-like 3 or A3) family are major antiviral factors that target a wide range of viruses. One of their targets is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1): the deaminase activity of some A3 proteins converts a fraction of cytidines of the viral genome into uridines, impairing its expression. Nevertheless, HIV-1 counteracts A3 proteins thanks to its Vif protein, which inhibits them by hijacking several cellular mechanisms. Besides, APOBEC3 proteins help maintaining the genome integrity by inhibiting retroelements but they also contribute to carcinogenesis, as it is the case for A3A and A3B, two major factors in this process. The large range of A3 activities, combined with recent studies showing their implication in the regulation of emerging viruses (Zika, SARS-CoV-2), allow A3 and their viral partners to be considered as therapeutic areas.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Navy Medicine's Role 2 Light Maneuver (R2LM) Emergency Resuscitative Surgical Systems (ERSS) are austere surgical teams manned, trained, and equipped to provide life-saving damage control resuscitation and surgery in any environment on land or sea. Given the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the previously established pre-deployment training pipeline for was modified to prepare a new R2LM team augmenting a Role 1 shipboard medical department. METHODS: The modified curriculum created in response to COVID-19 related restriction is compared and contrasted to the established pre-deployment R2LM ERSS curriculum. Subject Matter Experts and currently deployed R2LM members critically evaluate the two curricula. RESULTS: Both curricula included the team R2LM platform training and exposure to cadaver based team trauma skills training. The modified curriculum included didactics on shipboard resuscitation, anesthesia and surgery, shipboard COVID-19 management, and prolonged field care in austere maritime environments. CONCLUSIONS: We describe Navy Medicines R2LM ERSS capability and compare and contrast the standard R2LM pre-COVID-19 curriculum to the modified curriculum. Central to both curricula, the standard R2LM platform training is important for developing and honing team dynamics, communication skills and fluid leadership; important for the successful function austere surgical teams. Several opportunities for improvement in the pre-deployment training were identified for R2LM teams augmenting shipboard Role 1 medical departments.

AB  - Older adults (OA) prefer positive over negative information in a lab setting, compared to young adults (YA; i.e., positivity effects). The extent to which OA avoid negative events or information relevant for their health and safety is not clear. We first investigated age differences in preferences for fear-enhancing vs. fear-reducing news articles during the Ebola Outbreak of 2014. We were able to collect data from 15 YA and 13 OA during this acute health event. Compared to YA, OA were more likely to read the fear-enhancing article, select hand-sanitizer over lip balm, and reported greater fear of Ebola. We further investigated our research question during the COVID-19 pandemic with 164 YA (18-30 years) and 171 OA (60-80 years). Participants responded to an online survey about the COVID-19 pandemic across 13 days during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States (U.S.). Both YA and OA preferred to read positive over negative news about the coronavirus, but OA were even more likely than YA to prefer the positive news article. No age differences in the fear of contraction were found, but OA engaged in more health-protective behaviors compared to YA. Although OA may not always report greater fear than YA or seek out negative information related to a health concern, they still engage in protective health behaviors. Thus, although positivity effects were observed in attention and emotional reports (in the COVID-19 study), OA still modified their behaviors more than YA (giveaway in both studies, and health-protective behavior change in the COVID-19 study), suggesting that positivity effects did not hamper OA ability to respond to a health crisis.

AB  - Respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 has caused widespread mortality, creating an urgent need for effective treatments and a long-term need for antivirals for future emergent coronaviruses. Pharmacotherapy for respiratory viruses has largely been unsuccessful with the exception of early treatment of influenza viruses, which shortens symptom duration and prevents infection in close contacts. Under the rapidly evolving circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, most clinical trials of experimental treatments in the United States have focused on later stages of the disease process. Worldwide, the clinical studies of the most impactful drugs, remdesivir and dexamethasone in ACTT-1, RECOVERY, and Solidarity, have studied hospitalized patients. Less than half of clinical trials in the U.S. have investigated oral agents, and the majority have taken place in hospitals at a disease stage where the viral load is already decreasing. The limited success of treatments for respiratory viruses and the viral dynamics of COVID-19 suggest that an antiviral therapy with the greatest impact against pandemic coronaviruses would be orally administered, well-tolerated, target a highly conserved viral protein or host-coronavirus interaction and could be used effectively throughout the world, including resource-poor settings. We examine the treatment of respiratory viral infections and current clinical trials for COVID-19 to provide a framework for effective antiviral therapy and prevention of future emergent coronaviruses and call attention to the need for continued preclinical drug discovery.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a high environmental stable virus. It is predominantly a respiratory pathogen that also affects the gastrointestinal tract. The ACE 2 receptor is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, with evidence of its high presence in the intestine, colon and cholangiocytes, and, in smaller proportion, in hepatocytes. SARS-CoV-2 has a gastrointestinal tropism that explains digestive symptoms and viral spread in stools. The characteristics of this virus include the S (Spike) protein that binds very stably to the ACE-2 receptor and, at the same time, SARS-CoV-2 produces dysbiosis and alterations in the gut-lung axis. It produces a clear T-cell response and a cytokines storm in the intestine and liver that would produce inflammatory bowel damage. Intestinal manifestations by order of frequency are loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain, where the latter could be a severity marker. In children, diarrhea is the most frequent symptom, usually mild and self-limiting. In the liver, hypertransaminasemia occurs in severe patients ranging from 40 to 60%. SARS-CoV-2 can re main in stools longer than in respiratory secretions, which would influence the spread of disease. This article highlights the importance of an early diagnosis of gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations, increase the index of suspicion, make a timely diagnosis, and recognize eventual complications of the disease. The potential oral-fecal route of transmission may influence the disease spread. Recognizing this finding is important to define isolation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to demonstrate the use of concept mapping as a method for analyzing pharmacy students' qualitative perceptions of their expectations of elective courses and to thus help guide delivery methods and course content. A survey containing demographic, Likert scale, and open-ended questions was administered to second-year pharmacy students prior to the start of elective courses and an innovative methodology, concept mapping, was used to identify major themes relating to student expectations. The association between preferred class delivery method (online versus in person) with student gender and English-as-a-second-language status (ESL) was also assessed. Note that this study was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-eight out of 133 students (74%) completed the survey. Overall, 56% students stated that they preferred online delivery of courses (68% of these students were female, 36% were male). ESL status did not impact preference. The most common themes relating to student course expectations were the desire to learn about the elective course topic as well "real-world" utility. Our combined data indicate that delivery method is a key factor contributing to students' choice of elective course and that concept mapping is an effective and efficient way to help identify student expectations of elective courses.

AB  - The COVID-19 has now been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. No approved drug is currently available; therefore, an urgent need has been developed for any antiviral therapy for COVID-19. Main protease 3CLpro of this novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) play a critical role in the disease propagation, and hence represent a crucial target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied a bioinformatics approach for drug repurposing to identify the possible potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main proteases 3CLpro (6LU7). In search of the anti-COVID-19 compound, we selected 145 phyto-compounds from Kabasura kudineer (KK), a poly-herbal formulation recommended by AYUSH for COVID-19 which are effective against fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath (similar to SARS-CoV2-like symptoms). The present study aims to identify molecules from natural products which may inhibit COVID-19 by acting on the main protease (3CLpro). Obtained results by molecular docking showed that Acetoside (-153.06), Luteolin 7 -rutinoside (-134.6) rutin (-133.06), Chebulagic acid (-124.3), Syrigaresinol (-120.03), Acanthoside (-122.21), Violanthin (-114.9), Andrographidine C (-101.8), myricetin (-99.96), Gingerenone -A (-93.9), Tinosporinone (-83.42), Geraniol (-62.87), Nootkatone (-62.4), Asarianin (-79.94), and Gamma sitosterol (-81.94) are main compounds from KK plants which may inhibit COVID-19 giving the better energy score compared to synthetic drugs. Based on the binding energy score, we suggest that these compounds can be tested against Coronavirus and used to develop effective antiviral drugs.

AB  - In addition to a number of scientific and medical questions about SARS-CoV-2 infection that still need to be answered, there is also the question of how this highly virulent virus and COVID-19 disease affect gametogenesis in humans. Even more important is the question of whether the virus can also enter and infect oocytes and possibly alter them in an unknown way, which could also affect the development and status of the human embryo. The answers to these questions are still poorly known, so we reviewed the human oocyte transcriptome and proteome obtained in our previous studies and found that human oocytes from the in vitro fertilization program expressed both the ACE2 and BSG genes and the corresponding ACE2 and BSG proteins. This means that human oocytes possess the molecular 'machinery' to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entrance and infection. According to various studies, especially in animal models, different viruses can infect oocytes, so infection of the oocyte with SARS-Cov-2 cannot be completely ruled out. A hypothetical model of human oocyte infection with this virus has been proposed.

AB  - The first evidence of individual targeting medicine appeared in ancient times thousands of years ago. Various therapeutic approaches have been established since then. However, even nowadays, conventional therapies do not take into consideration individuals' idiosyncrasy and genetic make-up, failing thus to be effective in some cases. Over time, the necessity of a more precise and effective treatment resulted in the development of a scientific field currently known as "personalized medicine." The numerous technological breakthroughs in this field have acknowledged personalized medicine as the next generation of diagnosis and treatment. Although personalized medicine has attracted a lot of attention the last years, there are still several obstacles hindering its application in clinical practice. These limitations have come to light recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This review describes the "journey" of personalized medicine over time, emphasizing on important milestones achieved through time. Starting from the treatment of malaria, as a first more personalized therapeutic approach, it highlights the need of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens based on individuals' genetic background. Furthermore, it aims at raising global awareness regarding the current limitations and the necessity of a personalized strategy to overpass healthcare problems and hence, the current crisis.

AB  - Declining life expectancy and increasing all-cause mortality in the United States have been associated with unhealthy behaviors, socioecological factors, and preventable disease. A growing body of basic science, clinical research, and population health evidence points to the benefits of healthy behaviors, environments and policies to maintain health and prevent, treat, and reverse the root causes of common chronic diseases. Similarly, innovations in research methodologies, standards of evidence, emergence of unique study cohorts, and breakthroughs in data analytics and modeling create new possibilities for producing biomedical knowledge and clinical translation. To understand these advances and inform future directions research, The Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit was convened at the University of Pittsburgh on December 4-5, 2019. The Summit's goal was to review current status and define research priorities in the six core areas of lifestyle medicine: plant-predominant nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, addictive behaviors, and positive psychology/social connection. Forty invited subject matter experts (1) reviewed existing knowledge and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many cancers, inflammatory- and immune-related disorders and other conditions; and (2) discussed the potential for applying cutting-edge molecular, cellular, epigenetic and emerging science knowledge and computational methodologies, research designs, and study cohorts to accelerate clinical applications across all six domains of lifestyle medicine. Notably, federal health agencies, such as the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration have begun to adopt "whole-person health and performance" models that address these lifestyle and environmental root causes of chronic disease and associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Recommendations strongly support leveraging emerging research methodologies, systems biology, and computational modeling in order to accelerate effective clinical and population solutions to improve health and reduce societal costs. New and alternative hierarchies of evidence are also be needed in order to assess the quality of evidence and develop evidence-based guidelines on lifestyle medicine. Children and underserved populations were identified as prioritized groups to study. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacts people with chronic diseases that are amenable to effective lifestyle medicine interventions, makes the Summit's findings and recommendations for future research particularly timely and relevant.

AB  - In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A (E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples. This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during the second wave of infections.Article Summary Line We identified a novel circulating lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Rio de Janeiro Brazil originated from B.1.1.28 lineage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was developed in the frameworks of Corona-omica-RJ (FAPERJ = E-26/210.179/2020) and Rede Corona-omica BR MCTI/FINEP (FINEP = 01.20.0029.000462/20, CNPq = 404096/2020-4).

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During virus infection, several pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced, leading to the "cytokine storm." Among these, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-1β seem to have a central role in the progression and exacerbation of the disease, leading to the recruitment of immune cells to infection sites. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway involved in different aspects of lymphocytes functionality. The involvement of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in autophagy modulation has recently been demonstrated. Moreover, preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect lymphocytes, playing a role in the modulation of autophagy. Several anti-rheumatic drugs, now proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, could modulate autophagy in lymphocytes, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with viral respiratory infections on acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Humans with viral respiratory infections, exposed to systemic NSAIDs. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. RESULTS: We screened 10 999 titles and abstracts and 738 full texts, including 87 studies. No studies addressed COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; none examined inpatient healthcare utilisation, quality of life or long-term survival. Effects of NSAIDs on mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with viral respiratory infections are unclear (three observational studies; very low certainty). Children with empyema and gastrointestinal bleeding may be more likely to have taken NSAIDs than children without these conditions (two observational studies; very low certainty). In patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory infections, ibuprofen is associated with a higher rate of reconsultations with general practitioners than paracetamol (one randomised controlled trial (RCT); low certainty). The difference in death from all causes and hospitalisation for renal failure and anaphylaxis between children with fever receiving ibuprofen versus paracetamol is likely to be less than 1 per 10 000 (1 RCT; moderate/high certainty). Twenty-eight studies in adults and 42 studies in children report adverse event counts. Most report that no severe adverse events occurred. Due to methodological limitations of adverse event counts, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of severe adverse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence for the absence of such risk. This is a rapid review with a number of limitations. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020176056.

AB  - Socioeconomic reasons post-COVID-19 demand unsupervised home-based rehabilitation and, specifically, artificial ambient intelligence with individualisation to support engagement and motivation. Artificial intelligence must also comply with accountability, responsibility, and transparency (ART) requirements for wider acceptability. This paper presents such a patient-centric individualised home-based rehabilitation support system. To this end, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Five Time Sit To Stand (FTSTS) tests evaluate daily living activity performance in the presence or development of comorbidities. We present a method for generating synthetic datasets complementing experimental observations and mitigating bias. We present an incremental hybrid machine learning algorithm combining ensemble learning and hybrid stacking using extreme gradient boosted decision trees and k-nearest neighbours to meet individualisation, interpretability, and ART design requirements while maintaining low computation footprint. The model reaches up to 100% accuracy for both FTSTS and TUG in predicting associated patient medical condition, and 100% or 83.13%, respectively, in predicting area of difficulty in the segments of the test. Our results show an improvement of 5% and 15% for FTSTS and TUG tests, respectively, over previous approaches that use intrusive means of monitoring such as cameras.

AB  - Understanding the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 progression and the impact of various pharmaceutical interventions is crucial for the clinical management of the disease. We developed a comprehensive mathematical framework based on the known mechanisms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, incorporating the renin-angiotensin system and ACE2, which the virus exploits for cellular entry, key elements of the innate and adaptive immune responses, the role of inflammatory cytokines, and the coagulation cascade for thrombus formation. The model predicts the evolution of viral load, immune cells, cytokines, thrombosis, and oxygen saturation based on patient baseline condition and the presence of comorbidities. Model predictions were validated with clinical data from healthy people and COVID-19 patients, and the results were used to gain insight into identified risk factors of disease progression including older age; comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension; and dysregulated immune response. We then simulated treatment with various drug classes to identify optimal therapeutic protocols. We found that the outcome of any treatment depends on the sustained response rate of activated CD8+ T cells and sufficient control of the innate immune response. Furthermore, the best treatment-or combination of treatments-depends on the preinfection health status of the patient. Our mathematical framework provides important insight into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and could be used as the basis for personalized, optimal management of COVID-19.

AB  - Efforts to address misinformation on social media have special urgency with the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In one effort, the World Health Organization (WHO) designed and publicized shareable infographics to debunk coronavirus myths. We used an experiment to test the efficacy of these infographics, depending on placement and source. We found that exposure to a corrective graphic on social media reduced misperceptions about the science of 1 false COVID-19 prevention strategy but did not affect misperceptions about prevention of COVID-19. Lowered misperceptions about the science persisted >1 week later. These effects were consistent when the graphic was shared by the World Health Organization or by an anonymous Facebook user and when the graphics were shared preemptively or in response to misinformation. Health organizations can and should create and promote shareable graphics to improve public knowledge.

AB  - Aim: To compare different pooling methods in an attempt to improve the COVID-19 PCR diagnostic capacities. Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios. Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times. Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand. Singular testing in situations of low prevalence should be systematically discouraged.

AB  - There are 22 different degree courses related to the Healthcare Professions in the Italian university system, which are divided into four areas. "Healthcare Professions of Prevention" is the fourth area and it is fundamental for the National Health Service. In particular, in this pandemic emergency situation, the contribution of the Prevention Technicians in the Environment and Workplaces (PTEW) is essential in the field and workplace management. The "Core Competence" of the PTEW is to carry out, with professional autonomy, prevention, verification, and control activities in the field of hygiene and safety of living and working environments. In the hospitals, the indications provided by national and/or regional authorities are implemented through procedures on good hygiene practices developed by PTEW (e.g., hand hygiene, "respiratory tract hygiene," environmental hygiene, social distancing, and use of Personal Protective Equipment). One of the activities is the health surveillance on the field by population monitoring. The protocols foreseen for the "in-flow of workers" involve a wider control between social life and work. The PTEW will use a Check List divided into 3 macro phases: Entry, Activity Context, and Exit, defining each behavior of the work phases with a constant presence of verification of the procedures. The PTEW will be a Leader on the topics of education, training, and persuasion, considering a New Principle that "transforms the worker as active part in the application and diffusion of the safety measures".

AB  - Most of what we know about adaptive immunity has come from inbred mouse studies, using methods that are often difficult or impossible to confirm in humans. In addition, vaccine responses in mice are often poorly predictive of responses to those same vaccines in humans. Here we use human tonsils, readily available lymphoid organs, to develop a functional organotypic system that recapitulates key germinal center features in vitro, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, plasmablast differentiation and class-switch recombination. We use this system to define the essential cellular components necessary to produce an influenza vaccine response. We also show that it can be used to evaluate humoral immune responses to two priming antigens, rabies vaccine and an adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine, and to assess the effects of different adjuvants. This system should prove useful for studying critical mechanisms underlying adaptive immunity in much greater depth than previously possible and to rapidly test vaccine candidates and adjuvants in an entirely human system.

AB  - Despite vast improvements in global vaccination coverage during the last decade, there is a growing trend in vaccine hesitancy and/or refusal globally. This has implications for the acceptance and coverage of a potential vaccine against COVID-19. In the United States, the number of children exempt from vaccination for "philosophical belief-based" non-medical reasons increased in 12 of the 18 states that allowed this policy from 2009 to 2017 (1). Meanwhile, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, especially in young children, have led to increasing rates of drug resistance that threaten our ability to treat infectious diseases. Vaccine hesitancy and antibiotic overuse exist side-by-side in the same population of young children, and it is unclear why one modality (antibiotics) is universally seen as safe and effective, while the other (vaccines) is seen as potentially hazardous by some. In this review, we consider the drivers shaping the use of vaccines and antibiotics in the context of three factors: individual incentives, risk perceptions, and social norms and group dynamics. We illustrate how these factors contribute to the societal and individual costs of vaccine underuse and antimicrobial overuse. Ultimately, we seek to understand these factors that are at the nexus of infectious disease epidemiology and social science to inform policy-making.

Its control is challenging because there is no effective vaccine or drug available for Coronavirus disease. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously named as 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), primarily targets the human respiratory system to lung lesions and lethal pneumonia. Natural products have always shown a crucial role in the process of drug development against various diseases. They could be leads for further drug development to combat emergent mutants of the coronavirus. In this review, the current status of natural compounds and their derivatives acting against different species of CoV are discussed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has had profound effects on global health, healthcare, and public health policy. It has also impacted education. Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an "unpurposed space" of exchange about the pandemic's challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into "purposed space" of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic's challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students' moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression-not only but especially in times of pandemic.

AB  - Internet and communication technologies enable the creation of tremendous amounts of textual, graphic, and pictorial information. User-generated content published through personal web pages, blogs, and social media platforms has not only increased the amount of information available, but also expanded its reach. However, this ubiquity of information and empowerment of its creators leads to potentially controversial, futile, and inaccurate content circulating throughout the world. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, this can create false hope, fear, anxiety, harm, and confusion amongst information stakeholders. The World Health Organization recently applied the term "infodemic" to the COVID-19 pandemic. This commentary briefly discusses the current infodemic, its potential consequences, and the role of libraries-specifically health sciences, biomedical, and medical libraries-to help counter the COVID-19 infodemic. The discussion also has relevance for infodemics relating to other health and non-health affairs.

AB  - Introduction School closures are associated with significant negative consequences and may exacerbate inequalities. They were implemented worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2 in the first half of 2020, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This review summarises the empirical evidence of their effect on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Methods The study protocol was registered on Prospero (ID:CRD42020213699). On 12 October 2020 we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, the WHO Global COVID-19 Research Database, ERIC, the British Education Index, and the Australian Education Index. We included empirical studies with quantitative estimates of the effect of school closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. We excluded prospective modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative synthesis due to data heterogeneity. Results We identified 3,318 articles, of which ten were included, with data from 146 countries. All studies assessed school closures, and one additionally examined re-openings. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Three studies, including the two at lowest risk of bias, reported no impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission; whilst the other seven reported protective effects. Effect sizes ranged from no association to substantial and important reductions in community transmission. Discussion Studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological interventions implemented close to school closures. Our results are consistent with school closures being ineffective to very effective. This variation may be attributable to differences in study design or real differences. With such varied evidence on effectiveness, and the harmful effects, policymakers should take a measured approach before implementing school closures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding to declare for the submitted work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:n/aAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of a highly pathogenic, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a once-in-a-century pandemic, having already infected over 63 million people worldwide. Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients due to their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and their direct antiviral ability against viruses including coronaviruses, respectively. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE and MedRxiv was conducted by three investigators from inception until July 30th 2020 and included any study type that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with Janus kinase-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clearly indicated risk estimates or those that permitted their back-calculation. Outcomes were synthesized using RevMan. RESULTS: Of 733 searched studies, we included four randomized and eleven non-randomized trials. Five of the studies were unpublished. Those who received Janus kinase-inhibitor had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39, p< 0.001) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26, p< 0.001), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95% CI, 10.68-48.54, p< 0.00001) when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.85, p< 0.05), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.00-3.59, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Janus kinase-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes in terms of mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes in regard to mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional well-conducted RCTs are needed to further elucidate the relationship between clinical outcomes and Janus kinase-inhibitors and Type I interferons in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Corona virus disease 2019 has spread worldwide, and appropriate drug design and screening activities are required to overcome the associated pandemic. Using computational simulation, blockade mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was clarified based on interactions between RBD and hesperidin. Interactions between anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and therapy were investigated based on the binding energy and druggability of the compounds, and they exhibited negative correlations; the compounds were classified into eight common types of structures with highest activity. An anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug screening strategy based on blocking S RBD/hACE2 binding was established according to the first key change (interactions between hesperidin and S RBD/hACE2) vs the second key change (interactions between anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and RBD/hACE2) trends. Our findings provide valuable information on the mechanism of RBD/hACE2 binding and on the associated screening strategies for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs based on blocking mechanisms of pockets.

AB  - The cell surface protein TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is an androgen-responsive serine protease important for prostate cancer progression and therefore an attractive therapeutic target. Besides its role in tumor biology, TMPRSS2 is also a key player in cellular entry by the SARS-CoV viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in huge losses in socio-economy, culture, and human lives for which safe and effective cures are highly demanded. The main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical enzyme for viral propagation in host cells and, like TMPRSS2, has been exploited for treatment of the infectious disease. Numerous natural compounds abundant in common fruits have been suggested with anti-coronavirus infection in the previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV. Here we show that screening of these compounds identified tannic acid a potent inhibitor of both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and TMPRSS2. Molecular analysis demonstrated that tannic acid formed a thermodynamically stable complex with the two proteins at a KD of 1.1 mM for Mpro and 1.77 mM for TMPRSS2. Tannic acid inhibited the activities of the two proteases with an IC50 of 13.4 mM for Mpro and 2.31 mM for TMPRSS2. Mpro protein. Consistently, functional assays using the virus particles pseudotyped (Vpp) of SARS-CoV2-S demonstrated that tannic acid suppressed viral entry into cells. Thus, our results demonstrate that tannic acid has high potential of developing anti-COVID-19 therapeutics as a potent dual inhibitor of two independent enzymes essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The role of skeletal muscle mass in modulating immune response and supporting metabolic stress has been increasingly confirmed. Patients with sarcopenia, characterized by reduced muscle mass and muscle strength, were reported to have poor immune response and metabolic stress when facing acute infection, major surgeries, and other attacks. Based on empirical data, patients with sarcopenia are speculated to have increased infection rates and dismal prognoses amid the current 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. COVID-19 infection also aggravates sarcopenia because of the increased muscle wasting caused by systematic inflammation and the reduced physical activity and inadequate nutrient intake caused by social isolation. Notably, the interventions targeting skeletal muscle are anticipated to break the vicious circle and benefit the treatment of both conditions. We recommend sarcopenia assessment for populations with advanced age, inactivity, chronic disease, cancers, and nutritional deficiency. Patients with sarcopenia and COVID-19 infection need intensive care and aggressive treatments. The provision of at-home physical activities together with protein supplementation is anticipated to reverse sarcopenia and promote the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The recommended protocols on nutritional support and physical activities are provided in detail.

AB  - This chapter discusses the current state of hospital-based simulation, including the unprecedented events of 2020's global COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital-based simulation training requires a new approach. The realities of social distancing and the operational demands of hospital staffing ratios warrant creative adaptations of traditional simulation training methods. Hospitals used simulation to improve patient outcomes by training healthcare staff and students through telesimulation, and tested systems and equipment using in situ simulation (ISS). Latent safety threats (LSTs) were identified and corrected to improve patient outcomes. Hospital-based simulation has been incorporated into newly licensed registered nurses (NLRNs) residency programs to prepare them for competent practice. Simulations are also used for preparing staff for low-incidence, high-risk medical emergencies or disasters, such as active shooter events. Hospital-based simulation training adds value to healthcare systems, but requires more evidence of its quantitative and qualitative impacts.

AB  - Loneliness is a pervasive problem recognised as a serious social issue, and the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated loneliness to greater prominence and concern. We expect a rise of a massive group of 'lonely' consumers who are deeply entrenched in the social isolation caused by COVID-19. There is an urgent need to revisit the phenomenon of lonely consumers to better prepare academic researchers, public policy makers and commercial managers in the post-COVID-19 era. Thus, this study conducts a synthesised review on past studies of lonely consumers. Based on an inductive analysis of 56 articles, 74 key themes are identified. These key themes are further categorised into five major clusters by way of a co-occurrence network analysis. Respectively, the five clusters address the psychological implications related to the dynamics between nonhuman attachment and consumers' loneliness, the commercial implications related to the paradoxical motivations of affiliation and self-affirmation in product selection and the dual information processing mechanism in response to advertisement appeals, and the social implications related to consumers' well-being in an ageing society and the anthropomorphic companionship in a virtual world. A list of research questions is proposed that concludes the review study.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global public health challenge. The viral pathogen responsible, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to the host receptor ACE2 through its spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates membrane fusion and viral entry. Although the role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is clear, studies have shown that ACE2 expression is extremely low in various human tissues, especially in the respiratory tract. Thus, other host receptors and/or co-receptors that promote the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells of the respiratory system may exist. In this study, we found that the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) specifically interacts with the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 S. Using both a SARS-CoV-2 virus pseudotype and authentic SARS-CoV-2, we found that overexpression of AXL in HEK293T cells promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry as efficiently as overexpression of ACE2, while knocking out AXL significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in H1299 pulmonary cells and in human primary lung epithelial cells. Soluble human recombinant AXL blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells expressing high levels of AXL. The AXL expression level is well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 S level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that AXL is a novel candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 which may play an important role in promoting viral infection of the human respiratory system and indicate that it is a potential target for future clinical intervention strategies.

AB  - Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in spreading COVID-19. To protect public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for applications in personal protective equipment and indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers (~300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size compared to the surgical mask and cloth masks (a couple of microns versus tens to hundreds of microns). A coronavirus strain was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV-2 than other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, since NaCl aerosols have been widely used in filtration tests, we compared the filtration efficiency obtained from the coronavirus aerosols and the NaCl aerosols. The NaCl aerosols were demonstrated as an eligible surrogate for the coronavirus aerosols in the filtration tests, when air filters and face masks with diverse pore sizes, morphologies, and efficiencies were used. Our work paves a new avenue for advancing air filtration by developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission. Moreover, the removal efficiency of the NaCl aerosols can be reasonably translated into understanding how air filters capture the coronavirus aerosols.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge the NSF RAPID grants (CBET-2029411 and CBET-2029330) for supporting our research.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study did not require IRB approval.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the SARS epidemic in 2003, the Chinese government has increased inputs to bolster the health care system. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the geographic maldistribution of health resources in China. We examine the spatial and temporal variation of the SARS epidemic using a difference-in-differences strategy. Our empirical results show that, compared with cities without SARS case reports, exogenous health shocks significantly increased the affected cities' medical resources supply. We provide multiple robustness tests to examine the validity of the main findings. Further study shows that the mechanism is because the SARS event increased the financial autonomy of the epidemic-affected cities, thus providing an incentive for local governments to increase health resources. Meanwhile, health shocks have little influence on the regions with only imported cases than the infected area. These findings provide a possible explanation for the inequality in the distribution of health resources.

AB  - Aggressive air pollution control in China since 2013 has achieved sharp decreases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with increased ozone (O3) concentrations. Due to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), China imposed nationwide restriction, leading to large reductions in economic activities and associated emissions. In particular, large decreases were found in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions (>50%) from transportation. However, O3 increased in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), which cannot be fully explained by changes in NOx and volatile organic compound (VOCs) emissions. In this study, the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was used to investigate O3 increase in the YRD. Our results show a significant increase of atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) indicated by enhanced oxidants levels (up to +25%) especially in southern Jiangsu, Shanghai and northern Zhejiang, inducing the elevated O3 during lockdown. Moreover, net P(HOx) of 0.4 to 1.6 ppb h-1 during lockdown (Case 2) was larger than the case without lockdown (Case 1), mainly resulting in the enhanced AOC and higher O3 production rate (+12%). This comprehensive analysis improves our understanding on AOC and associated O3 formation, which helps to design effective strategies to control O3.

AB  - Elucidating virus-cell interactions is fundamental to understanding viral replication and identifying targets for therapeutic control of viral infection. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has been shown to regulate pathogenesis during many viral infections, but its role during coronavirus infection is undetermined. Infectious bronchitis virus is the representative strain of Gammacoronavirus, which causes acute and highly contagious diseases in the poultry farm. In this study, we investigated the role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway in IBV infection. We found that IBV infection activated ERK1/2 signaling and the up-regulation of phosphatase DUSP6 formed a negative regulation loop. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling suppressed the expression of DUSP6, promoted cell death, and restricted virus replication. In contrast, suppression of DUSP6 by chemical inhibitor or siRNA increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, protected cells from apoptosis, and facilitated IBV replication. Overexpression of DUSP6 decreased the level of phospho-ERK1/2, promoted apoptosis, while dominant negative mutant DUSP6-DN lost the regulation function on ERK1/2 signaling and apoptosis. In conclusion, these data suggest that MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway facilitates IBV infection, probably by promoting cell survival; meanwhile, induction of DUSP6 forms a negative regulation loop to restrict ERK1/2 signaling, correlated with increased apoptosis and reduced viral load. Consequently, components of the ERK pathway, such as MEK1/2 and DUSP6, represent excellent targets for the development of antiviral drugs.

There has been a rapid increase in cases and deaths since it was identified in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019, with over 4,000,000 cases of COVID-19 including at least 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 2020. However, limited data about the clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 have been reported. Given the maternal physiologic and immune function changes during pregnancy, pregnant women may be at a higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and developing more complicated clinical events. Information on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) may provide insights into the effects of COVID-19's during pregnancy. Even though SARS and MERS have been associated with miscarriage, intrauterine death, fetal growth restriction and high case fatality rates, the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women has been reported to be similar to that in non-pregnant women. In addition, pregnant women do not appear to be at a higher risk of catching COVID-19 or suffering from more severe disease than other adults of similar age. Moreover, there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy or during childbirth. Babies and young children are also known to only experience mild forms of COVID-19. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy.

AB  - ApoE4, a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, has been associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether ApoE4 alters COVID-19 susceptibility or severity, and the role of direct viral infection in brain cells remains obscure. We tested the neurotropism of SARS-CoV2 in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models and observed low-grade infection of neurons and astrocytes that is boosted in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures and organoids. We then generated isogenic ApoE3/3 and ApoE4/4 hiPSCs and found an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ApoE4/4 neurons and astrocytes. ApoE4 astrocytes exhibited enlarged size and elevated nuclear fragmentation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we show that remdesivir treatment inhibits SARS-CoV2 infection of hiPSC neurons and astrocytes. These findings suggest that ApoE4 may play a causal role in COVID-19 severity. Understanding how risk factors impact COVID-19 susceptibility and severity will help us understand the potential long-term effects in different patient populations.

AB  - During COVID-19, diagnostic serological tools and vaccines have been developed. To inform control activities in a post-vaccine surveillance setting, we have developed an online "immuno-analytics" resource that combines epitope, sequence, protein and SARS-CoV-2 mutation analysis. SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins are both vaccine and serological diagnostic targets. Using the tool, the nucleocapsid protein appears to be a sub-optimal target for use in serological platforms. Spike D614G (and nsp12 L314P) mutations were most frequent (> 86%), whilst spike A222V/L18F have recently increased. Also, Orf3a proteins may be a suitable target for serology. The tool can accessed from: http://genomics.lshtm.ac.uk/immuno (online); https://github.com/dan-ward-bio/COVID-immunoanalytics (source code).

AB  - Treatment of patients with cancer in hospitals or clinics is resource-intensive and imposes a burden on patients. 'Flexible care' is a term that can be used to describe treatment administered outside the oncology ward, oncological outpatient clinic or office-based oncologist setting. Programmes that reduce travel burden by bringing cancer treatment to the patient's home, workplace or closer to the patient's home, in the form of satellite clinics or mobile cancer units, expand treatment capacity and are well received. Clinical trial data show that, compared with intravenous administration, subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of trastuzumab is preferred by patients with breast cancer (BC), saves healthcare professionals' (HCPs) time, reduces drug preparation and administration time and reduces direct and indirect costs. As such, s.c. trastuzumab is well suited to flexible care. The results of a Belgian study (BELIS) show that home administration of s.c. trastuzumab is feasible and preferred by patients with BC. Numerous programmes and pilot studies in Europe show that s.c. trastuzumab can be administered effectively in the patient's home, in primary care settings or local hospitals. Such programmes require planning, training, careful patient selection and technology to link patients, caregivers and specialists in oncology clinics. Once these elements are in place, flexible care offers patients with BC a choice of how treatment may be delivered and lead to improved quality of life, while reducing pressure on HCPs and hospitals. The concept of flexible care is particularly relevant amid the COVID-19 pandemic where guidelines have been developed encouraging remote care.

AB  - Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69 and V70 in the virus S gene. This includes strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK. Here, we analyze 2 million RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at Helix to identify the rate of S gene dropout, which has been recently shown to occur in tests from individuals infected with strains of SARS-CoV-2 that carry the H69del/V70del mutation. We observe a rise in S gene dropout in the US starting in early October, with 0.25% of our daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the first week. The rate of positive samples with S gene dropout has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the highest level yet, at 0.5%. Focusing on the 14 states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event (n&gt;1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the Eastern part of the US, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL. However, we cannot say from these data whether the S gene dropout samples we observe here represent the B.1.1.7. strain. Only with an expansion of genomic surveillance sequencing in the US will we know for certain the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 strain in the US.Competing Interest StatementAll authors are employees of Helix.Funding StatementNoneAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:WCG Institutional Review Board (WCGIRB) approved a request for a waiver for this study under protocol 20203438.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic forced a rapid transition of in-class residency conferences to online residency conferences; little is known about learners' perceptions of this new didactic environment. Understanding learners' perceptions of virtual classrooms can help inform current and future best practices for online, synchronous, graduate medical education. METHODS: We surveyed emergency medicine and internal medicine residency programs at a large urban academic medical center about their perceptions of synchronous online residency conferences. RESULTS: Residents reported a preference for in-class interactions with peers (85%) and lecturers (80%), with 62% reporting decreased levels of engagement with lecturers during online conferences. Residents reported performing nearly twice as many non-conference-related activities (eg, email, exercise) during online conferences vs in-class conferences. Residents felt that the following methods improved engagement during online conferences: lecturers answering chat questions; small group sessions; and gamification of lectures. CONCLUSION: Synchronous online residency conferences were associated with decreased engagement and attention by learners. Simple methods to increase interactivity may help improve the online classroom experience and cultivate novel teaching environments that better support current learning styles.

AB  - We read with interest the paper by Coll et al. that reported a mortality rate of 27% in a large series of transplant recipients with concurrent COVID-19; with nosocomial acquisition in 13% of cases.1 Outside the pandemic setting, however, solid-organ-transplant (SOT) recipients are more likely to experience prolonged and severe illness from common respiratory-viral-infections (RVIs), and healthcare-associated-RVI (HA-RVI) is a significant issue. The impetus for implementation of aggressive infection-prevention measures against COVID-19 on transplant units may reduce HA-RVI as a positive consequence.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic required rapid curriculum adaptation to online delivery. Given the importance of accurate clinical patient handoffs, we adapted simulation-based medical student training in clinical patient handoffs. We scored the accuracy of the information students presented. We also elicited student feedback to determine their perceptions of the event and their evaluations of the effectiveness of the training. Methods: Twenty-six third-year medical students participated online via Zoom. Students participated in groups of three or four students. They sequentially encountered a standardized patient. Clinical information and physical exam findings were handed off from student to student until the encounter was complete. The student group then debriefed with faculty. Students were evaluated based on the proportion of clinical information handed off to the following student. Students also evaluated the training session. Results: The first student handoff included 73.4% of the available information. In subsequent handoffs, the percentage fell to 43%. All students said they felt the training was helpful in practicing patient handoffs and interactions with colleagues. Negative student comments focused on perceived deficiencies in session planning and standardized patient training. Conclusions: This rapidly developed simulation session demonstrated that clinical training in patient handoffs can be adapted to an online environment. In order to ensure success, faculty should carefully consider logistical adjustments required to transition from a patient contact setting to an online environment. Meticulous preparation and attention to detail will ensure that training is successful.

AB  - Patients affected by pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) benefit from intensive, continuous clinical monitoring to guide escalation of treatments that carry the potential to improve survival and quality of life. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the need for physical distancing has fueled the expeditious expansion of various telehealth modalities, which may apply in a unique manner to individuals with PAH. Performance of objective risk assessments in patients with PAH remotely via telemedical visits and other telehealth mechanisms is unprecedented and not yet rigorously validated. The uniquely high risk for rapid deterioration in patients with PAH demands a high degree of sensitivity to detect changes in functional assessments. In this review, several telehealth modalities for potential utilization in risk assessment and treatment titration in patients with PAH are explored, yet additional study is needed for their validation with the pre-pandemic care paradigm.

AB  - On March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 The pandemic evolved rapidly, forcing providers to face previously unconsidered health care delivery scenarios. Medical and dental professionals sought guidance. This article presents an overview of the questions, concerns, and requests physicians and dentists shared with patient safety risk management consultants (PSRMs) at a large medical professional liability company. During the first 5 months of the pandemic, PSRMs handled more than 1200 calls related to COVID-19. Analysis of call data provides insight into front line provider concerns as the pandemic evolved.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented change throughout society.1 As the articles in this supplement outline, all segments of the broader cardiovascular community have been forced to adapt, to change models of care delivery, and to evolve and innovate in order to deliver optimal management for cardiovascular patients. The medtech/device industry has not been exempt from such change and has been forced to navigate direct and indirect COVID-associated disruption, with effects felt from supply chain logistics to the entire product lifecycle, from the running of clinical trials to new device approvals and managing training, proctoring and congresses in an increasingly-online world. This sea-change in circumstances itself has enforced the industry, in effect, to disrupt its own processes, models and activities. Whilst some of these changes may be temporary, many will endure for some time and some will doubtless become permanent; one thing is for sure: the healthcare ecosystem, including the medical device industry, will never look quite the same again. Although the pandemic has brought a short- to medium-term medical crisis to many countries, its role as a powerful disruptor cannot be underestimated, and may indeed prove to be a force for long-term good, given the accelerated innovation and rapid adaptation that it has cultivated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Communication in healthcare has influenced and been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this position paper, we share observations based on the latest available evidence and experiential knowledge that have emerged during the pandemic, with a specific focus on policy and practice. METHODS: This is a position paper that presents observations relating to policy and practice in communication in healthcare related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Through our critical observations as experts in the field of healthcare communication, we share our stance how healthcare communication has occured during the pandemic and suggest possible ways of improving policy and professional practice. We make recommendations for policy makers, healthcare providers, and communication experts while also highlighting areas that merit further investigation regarding healthcare communication in times of healthcare crises. CONCLUSION: We have witnessed an upheaval of healthcare practice and the development of policy on-the-run. To ensure that policy and practice are evidence-based, person-centred, more inclusive and equitable, we advocate for critical reflection on this symbiotic relationship between COVID-19 and the central role of communication in healthcare. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This paper provides a summary of the key areas for development in communication in healthcare during COVID-19. It offers recommendations for improvement and a call to review policies and practice to build resilience and inclusive and equitable responsiveness in communication in healthcare.

AB  - At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, high hopes were put on digital contact tracing, using mobile phone apps to record and immediately notify contacts when a user reports as infected. Such apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as second waves of COVID-19 are raging, these apps are playing a less important role than anticipated. We argue that this is because most countries have opted for app configurations that cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Mathematical modelling suggests that differently configured apps have the potential to do this. These require, however, that some pseudonymised data be stored on a central server, which privacy advocates have cautioned against. We contend that their influential arguments are subject to two fallacies. First, they have tended to one-sidedly focus on the risks that centralised data storage entails for privacy, while paying insufficient attention to the fact that inefficient contact tracing involves ethical risks too. Second, while the envisioned system does entail risks of breaches, such risks are also present in decentralised systems, which have been falsely presented as 'privacy preserving by design'. When these points are understood, it becomes clear that we must rethink our approach to digital contact tracing in our fight against COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess whether ventricular longitudinal strain can be used as a prognostication tool in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC databases were performed on 16 November 2020. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) refers to LV contraction measurement using the speckle tracking-based method refers to the mean of strain values of the RV free wall (three segments) measured using echocardiography. The main outcome was poor outcome, defined as a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Seven studies comprising of 612 patients were included in meta-analysis. Six studies have mortality as their outcome, and 1 study has severity as their outcome. Patients with poor outcome have lower LV-GLS (SMD 1.15 (0.57, 1.72), p < 0.001; I2 70.4%). Each 1% decrease in LV-GLS was associated with 1.4x increased risk of poor outcome (OR 1.37 (1.12, 1.67), p = 0.002; I2 48.8%). Patients with poor outcome have lower RV-LS (SMD 1.18 (0.91, 1.45), p < 0.001; I2 0%). Each 1% decrease in RV-LS was associated with 1.3x increased risk of poor outcome (OR 1.25 (1.15, 1.35), p < 0.001; I2 11.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that for every 1% decrease in LV-GLS and RV-LS is increased mortality with OR of 1.30 (1.12, 1.50) and OR of 1.24 (1.14, 1.35), respectively. CONCLUSION: This study shows that lower LV-GLS and RV-LS measurements were associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020221144.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global pandemic. The case number has increased since December 31, 2019. It has been reported that COVID-19 patients have been giving pain complaints, one of which is muscular pain. Other types of pain that have also been reported by COVID-19 patients are joint pain, stomach pain, and testicular pain. Neuropathic pain is the rarest case among others. COVID-19 mechanisms in the nerve and musculoskeletal damage are believed to be caused by the expression and distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). Patients with pain, especially neuropathic pain, normally do not respond well to various therapies, and experience psychiatric disorders such as depression, which leads to a decrease in the patient's quality of life. Important considerations for health professionals in terms of pain management during this pandemic include ensuring treatment continuity, painkillers, utilization of telemedicine, biopsychosocial management approach, and modifying therapy needs to reduce the risks of COVID-19 complications.

AB  - Nowadays, it is common for people to look for health care information on the internet. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is commonly used to measure eHealth literacy. As of the publication of this study, the Indonesian version for eHEALS has not been published even though eHealth literacy is necessary, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Indonesian version of eHEALS (I-eHEALS). A total of 100 respondents in East Java were involved in this cross-sectional study. Pearson-product moment correlation method and construct validity were used to validate the results. The reliability was determined based on the Cronbach's alpha internal consistency measurement and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The Pearson correlation analysis results are significantly higher (r > 0.254, p < 0.01) compared to the critical value table. Single factors accounting for 57.66% variance in the scales exhibit a unidimensional latent structure. The internal consistency between items is excellent as shown by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.91). The ICC analysis shows an acceptable result (0.552, p < 0.01). The I-eHEALS is valid and reliable to be used for evaluating the eHealth literacy of the Indonesian population.

AB  - Vaccination plays an important role in pandemic planning and response. The possibility of developing an effective vaccine for a novel pandemic virus is not assured. However, as we have seen with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, with sufficient resources and global focus, successful outcomes can be achieved in a relatively short period. However even when vaccine is available it will initially be scarce. When one becomes available, how should it be distributed? In this paper we explicate how ethical thinking that is carefully attuned to context is essential to decisions about how we should conduct vaccination in a pandemic where demand exceeds supply. We focus on two key issues. First, setting the aims for a pandemic vaccination programme. Second, thinking about the means of delivering a chosen aim. We outline how pandemic vaccine distribution strategies can be implemented with distinct aims, e.g. protecting groups at greater risk of harm, saving the most lives, or ensuring societal benefit. Each aim will result in a focus on a different priority population and each strategy will have a different benefit-harm profile. Once we have decided our aim, we still have choices to make about delivery. We may achieve at least some ends via direct or indirect strategies. Such policy decisions are not merely technical, but necessarily involve ethics. One important general issue is that such planning decisions about distribution will always be made under conditions of uncertainty about vaccine safety and effectiveness. However, planning how to distribute vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is even harder because we understand relatively little about the virus, transmission, and its immunological impact in the short and long term.

AB  - BACKGROUND In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care decision-makers in North Carolina needed information about the available health workforce in order to conduct workforce surge planning and to anticipate concerns about professional or geographic workforce shortages.METHOD Descriptive and cartographic analyses were conducted using licensure data held by the North Carolina Health Professions Data System to assess the supply of respiratory therapists, nurses, and critical care physicians in North Carolina. Licensure data were merged with population data and numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) beds drawn from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS).RESULTS The pandemic highlighted how critical data infrastructure is to public health infrastructure. Respiratory therapists and acute care, emergency, and critical care nurses were diffused broadly throughout the state, with higher concentrations in urban areas. Critical care physicians were primarily based in areas with academic health centers.LIMITATIONS Data were unavailable to capture the rapid changes in supply due to clinicians reentering or exiting the workforce. County-level analyses did not reflect individual, facility-level supply, which was needed to plan organizational responses.CONCLUSIONS Health care decision-makers in North Carolina were able to access information about the supply of clinicians critical to caring for COVID-19 patients due to the state's long-standing investments in health workforce data infrastructure. Ability to respond was made easier due to strong working relationships between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, the North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Program, the health professional licensure boards, and state government health care agencies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the perception of the initial ASRM COVID-19 recommendations for infertility treatment held by women's health providers within varying subspecialties, as well as their attitudes toward pregnancy and fertility during this time. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to all women's healthcare providers, including physicians, mid-level providers and nurses, in all subspecialties of obstetrics and gynaecology (Ob/Gyn) at a large tertiary care university-affiliated hospital. RESULTS: Of the 278 eligible providers, the survey response rate was 45% (n = 127). Participants represented 8 Ob/Gyn subspecialties and all professional levels. Participants age 18-30 years were significantly more likely to feel that women should have access to infertility treatment despite the burden level of COVID-19 in respective community/states (p = 0.0058). Participants within the subspecialties of general Ob/Gyn, maternal foetal medicine and gynecologic oncology were significantly more likely to disagree that all women should refrain from planned conception during the COVID-19 pandemic, in comparison to those in urogynecology and reproductive endocrinology and infertility (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the immediate and unknown long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility care delivery, a better understanding of perceptions regarding infertility management during this time is important. Our study shows overall support for the initial ASRM recommendations, representing a wide spectrum of women's health providers.

AB  - In this paper we explore whether countries led by women have fared better during the COVID-19 pandemic than those led by men. Media and public health officials have lauded the perceived gender-related influence on policies and strategies for reducing the deleterious effects of the pandemic. We examine this proposition by analyzing COVID-19-related deaths globally across countries led by men and women. While we find some limited support for lower reported fatality rates in countries led by women, they are not statistically significant. Country cultural values offer more substantive explanation for COVID-19 outcomes. We offer several potential explanations for the pervasive perception that countries led by women have fared better during the pandemic, including data selection bias and Western media bias that amplified the successes of women leaders in OECD countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for two novel virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab, and REGN-COV2 (casirivimab plus imdevimab), for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adolescents and adults in specified high-risk groups. This has challenged clinicians to determine the best approach to use of these products. METHODS: A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacy, pediatric intensive care medicine, and pediatric hematology from 29 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a guidance statement was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is typically mild and there is no high-quality evidence supporting any high risk groups. There is no evidence for safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, limited evidence of modest benefit in adults, and evidence for potential harm associated with infusion reactions or anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence available as of December 20, 2020, the panel suggests against routine administration of monoclonal antibody therapy (bamlanivimab, or casirivimab and imdevimab), for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, including those designated by the FDA as at high risk of progression to hospitalization or severe disease. Clinicians and health systems choosing to use these agents on an individualized basis should consider risk factors supported by pediatric-specific evidence, and ensure implementation of a system for safe and timely administration that does not exacerbate existing healthcare disparities.

AB  - Hong Kong, Singapore, and Beijing have some of the highest numbers of international arrivals and densest living spaces globally, yet these cities have reported low numbers of deaths amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Primary care has played different roles in each of the health systems in combatting the pandemic. Both Hong Kong and Singapore have a 2-tiered health system with the majority of primary care provided in the private sector. The primary care system in Beijing consists of community health facilities, township health centers, and village clinics. The role of primary care in Hong Kong includes using the public primary care clinics as part of an enhanced surveillance program together with accident and emergency departments, as well as triaging patients with suspected infection to hospitals. Singapore's response to COVID-19 has included close cooperation between redeveloped polyclinics and private and public health preparedness clinics to provide screening with swab tests for suspected cases in the primary care setting. Beijing's unique response has consisted of using online platforms for general practitioners to facilitate monitoring among community residents, as well as public health education and a mobilized pharmacy refill program to reduce risk of transmission. Established challenges, however, include shortages of personal protective equipment and the heavy workload for health care staff. Regardless, all 3 cities have demonstrated enhanced preparedness since experiencing the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, and the responses of their primary care systems therefore may offer learning points for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has inflicted a serious health crisis globally. This virus is associated with a spectrum of respiratory illness ranging from asymptomatic, mild to severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Accumulating evidence supports that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory illness per se, but potentially affects other organ systems including the placenta. SARS-CoV-2 gains access to human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). The abundance of ACE-2 on the placental cell surface, especially the syncytiotrophoblasts, could potentially contribute to vertical transplacental transmission to the fetus following maternal COVID-19 infection. Intriguingly, despite the placentas being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, there are very few newborns that manifest virus-induced diseases. The protective effects of the placental barrier to viral infection, limiting the spread of the virus to newborn infants, remain a mystery. The detrimental role of COVID-19 in pregnancies is largely debatable, although COVID-19 maternal infection has been implicated in unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. In this review, we summarize the pathological features manifested in placenta due to COVID-19 maternal infection that have been previously reported, and relate them to the possible disease manifestation. The potential mechanistic pathways associated with transplacental viral transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes are also discussed.

AB  - Viral infections may cause neurological disorders by directly inducing oxidative stress and interrupting immune system function, both of which contribute to neuronal death. Several reports have described the neurological manifestations in Covid-19 patients where, in severe cases of the infection, brain inflammation and encephalitis are common. Recently, extensive research-based studies have revealed and acknowledged the clinical and preventive roles of melatonin in some viral diseases. Melatonin has been shown to have antiviral properties against several viral infections which are accompanied by neurological symptoms. The beneficial properties of melatonin relate to its properties as a potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory molecule and its neuroprotective effects. In this review, what is known about the therapeutic role of melatonin in virus-induced neuropathogenesis is summarized and discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Public health responses often lack the infrastructure to capture the impact of public health emergencies on pregnant women and infants, with limited mechanisms for linking pregnant women with their infants nationally to monitor long-term effects. In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in close collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments, began a 5-year initiative to establish population-based mother-baby linked longitudinal surveillance, the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an expanded surveillance approach that leverages and modernizes existing surveillance systems to address the impact of emerging health threats during pregnancy on pregnant women and their infants. METHODS: Mother-baby pairs are identified through prospective identification during pregnancy and/or identification of an infant with retrospective linking to maternal information. All data are obtained from existing data sources (e.g., electronic medical records, vital statistics, laboratory reports, and health department investigations and case reporting). RESULTS: Variables were selected for inclusion to address key surveillance questions proposed by CDC and health department subject matter experts. General variables include maternal demographics and health history, pregnancy and infant outcomes, maternal and infant laboratory results, and child health outcomes up to the second birthday. Exposure-specific modular variables are included for hepatitis C, syphilis, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The system is structured into four relational datasets (maternal, pregnancy outcomes and birth, infant/child follow-up, and laboratory testing). DISCUSSION: SET-NET provides a population-based mother-baby linked longitudinal surveillance approach and has already demonstrated rapid adaptation to COVID-19. This innovative approach leverages existing data sources and rapidly collects data and informs clinical guidance and practice. These data can help to reduce exposure risk and adverse outcomes among pregnant women and their infants, direct public health action, and strengthen public health systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, infecting millions of people. A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed and remains a global health priority. Subunit vaccines are used successfully against other viruses when administered in the presence of an effective adjuvant. METHODS: We evaluated three different clinically tested adjuvant systems in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilized (S-2P) spike protein using a one-dose regimen in mice. FINDINGS: Whilst spike protein alone was only weakly immunogenic, the addition of either Aluminum hydroxide, a squalene based oil-in-water emulsion system (SE) or a cationic liposome-based adjuvant significantly enhanced antibody responses against the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Kinetics of antibody responses differed, with SE providing the most rapid response. Neutralizing antibodies developed after a single immunization in all adjuvanted groups with ID50 titers ranging from 86-4063. Spike-specific CD4 T helper responses were also elicited, comprising mainly of IFN-γ and IL-17 producing cells in the cationic liposome adjuvanted group, and more IL-5- and IL-10-secreting cells in the AH group. INTERPRETATION: These results demonstrate that adjuvanted spike protein subunit vaccine is a viable strategy for rapidly eliciting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and CD4 T cell responses of various qualities depending on the adjuvant used, which can be explored in further vaccine development against COVID-19. FUNDING: This work was supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 101003653.

AB  - There has been concern about possible long-term sequelae resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying such a "post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome" is essential for the development of preventive and early treatment methods for this syndrome. In the present paper, by integrating insights pertaining to the glymphatic system and the nasal cerebrospinal fluid outflow pathway with findings in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and COVID-19, I provide a coherent conceptual framework for understanding the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. According to this hypothesis, this syndrome may result from damage to olfactory sensory neurons, causing reduced outflow of cerebrospinal fluid through the cribriform plate, and further leading to congestion of the glymphatic system with subsequent toxic build-up within the central nervous system. I further postulate that patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid drainage by restoring glymphatic transport and waste removal from the brain. Obviously, further research is required to provide further evidence for the presence of this post-viral syndrome, and to provide additional insight regarding the relative contribution of the glymphatic-lymphatic system to it. Other mechanisms may also be involved. If confirmed, the glymphatic-lymphatic system could represent a target in combating post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. Moreover, further research in this area could also provide new insights into the understanding of chronic fatigue syndrome.

AB  - Despite the tremendous success of X-ray cryo-crystallography in recent decades, the transfer of crystals from the drops in which they are grown to diffractometer sample mounts remains a manual process in almost all laboratories. Here, the Shifter, a motorized, interactive microscope stage that transforms the entire crystal-mounting workflow from a rate-limiting manual activity to a controllable, high-throughput semi-automated process, is described. By combining the visual acuity and fine motor skills of humans with targeted hardware and software automation, it was possible to transform the speed and robustness of crystal mounting. Control software, triggered by the operator, manoeuvres crystallization plates beneath a clear protective cover, allowing the complete removal of film seals and thereby eliminating the tedium of repetitive seal cutting. The software, either upon request or working from an imported list, controls motors to position crystal drops under a hole in the cover for human mounting at a microscope. The software automatically captures experimental annotations for uploading to the user's data repository, removing the need for manual documentation. The Shifter facilitates mounting rates of 100-240 crystals per hour in a more controlled process than manual mounting, which greatly extends the lifetime of the drops and thus allows a dramatic increase in the number of crystals retrievable from any given drop without loss of X-ray diffraction quality. In 2015, the first in a series of three Shifter devices was deployed as part of the XChem fragment-screening facility at Diamond Light Source, where they have since facilitated the mounting of over 120 000 crystals. The Shifter was engineered to have a simple design, providing a device that could be readily commercialized and widely adopted owing to its low cost. The versatile hardware design allows use beyond fragment screening and protein crystallography.

AB  - Outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 occurred in Wuhan and has rapidly spread to almost all parts of world. GB-1, the herbal formula from Tian Shang Sheng Mu of Chiayi Puzi Peitian Temple, is used for the prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan. In this study, we investigated that the effect of GB-1 and the index compounds of GB-1 on the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression through in vitro and in vivo study. In our result, GB-1 can inhibit ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression in HepG2 cells, 293T cells, and Caco-2 cells without cytotoxicity. For the mouse model, GB-1 treatment could decrease ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of the lung and kidney tissue without adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. In the compositions of GB-1, 0.5-1 mg/ml of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC. extract could not inhibit ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in HepG2 cells. In addition, theaflavin-3-gallate could inhibit protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 without significant cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that GB-1 and theaflavin-3-gallate could act as potential candidates for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection through inhibiting protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the further study.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has become a global crisis. As of November 9, COVID-19 has already spread to more than 190 countries with 50,000,000 infections and 1,250,000 deaths. Effective therapeutics and drugs are in high demand. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved with those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV. Enzymes, including RdRp, Mpro /3CLpro , and PLpro , which play important roles in viral transcription and replication, have been regarded as key targets for therapies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The identification of readily available drugs for repositioning in COVID-19 therapy is a relatively rapid approach for clinical treatment, and a series of approved or candidate drugs have been proven to be efficient against COVID-19 in preclinical or clinical studies. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and the targets involved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has become a common threat to global human health and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Some asymptomatic patients with early-stage lung cancer who have COVID-19 receive surgical treatment but develop severe pneumonia and other complications or even experience postoperative death, and they may have a worse prognosis compared with healthy individuals infected with COVID-19. However, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 in lung cancer patients and provide evidence-based medical support for clinical treatment. METHODS: We will search 6 medical databases to identify eligible studies published from the establishment of the database to the present. The quality of the included literature will be evaluated using the bias risk assessment tool in Cochrane 5.1.0, and a meta-analysis will be performed using Stata 14.0. Heterogeneity will be statistically assessed using χ2 tests. RESULTS: The study will integrate existing research findings to investigate the prevalence and severity rate of patients with lung cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the prognosis and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with or without COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence to support whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for lung cancer and provide guidance for clinical prevention and treatment based on the evidence obtained in light of the unpredictable threat posed by COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review as it will involve the collection and analysis of secondary data. The results of the review will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals. PRORPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020195967.

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 disease due to SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 was rapidly associated with the isolation of the strain from co-culture onto VERO cells. These isolations quickly made it possible to carry out the first tests for antiviral agents' susceptibility and drug repurposing. However, it seems important to make an inventory of all the cells that can support the growth of this virus and evaluate possible differences between isolates. In the present work, we tested 4 strains of SARS-CoV-2 locally isolated on a panel of 34 cell lines present in our laboratory and commonly used for the isolation of human pathogenic microorganism. After inoculation, cells were observed for cytopathic effects and quantitative real-time polymerase reaction was used to measure the virus replication on the cells. We were able to obtain growth on 7 cell lines, 6 simian, and the human Caco-2. The cytopathogenic effects are variable, ranging from lysis of the cell monolayer in 48-72 h to no cytopathic effect in spite of intense multiplication, as in Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, effect and multiplication varied widely according to the strain tested. In this paper, we explored the species specificity and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro on a panel of cells available in our laboratory and identified human and animal cell lines susceptible to support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our work highlights the importance of testing multiple strains when testing antiviral molecules and performing patho-physiological analyzes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted all aspects of health care, including nursing education. Senior nursing students saw the elimination of in-person clinical opportunities in the final months prior to graduation as health care facilities restricted access to essential personnel in an effort to minimize transmission of the virus and conserve personal protective equipment. METHOD: To fulfill course requirements, faculty created a COVID-19 assignment that implored students to research the most current infection control recommendations for COVID-19 and to describe the impacts of the virus on nursing care, patients, families, interdisciplinary collaboration, and public safety. RESULTS: The COVID-19 assignment fostered clinical reasoning and encouraged personal reflection with application to practice. Students reported that the assignment greatly enhanced knowledge and awareness of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This assignment was beneficial for transition to practice in the midst of a pandemic, and it can be easily replicated for any future emerging health care topic that may affect nursing education.

AB  - Any crisis (personal or collective) brings along an in-built stress. It cripples people from living a normal life; sometimes it leads people to the extreme condition of permanent damage. The COVID-19 situation has brought in unexpected misery - victimizing millions of people. It has been an equalizer as both the rich and the poor have been affected; both the affluent and the developing countries have become a prey to the pandemic. For nearly one year the world is wondering which way to turn for comfort or solution, as the fear of the second and third waves looms over. Science has not given the timely preventive medication; world leaders are not able to lead the people with effective insight; financial system is on the brink of collapse; and even the faith of people seems to become a question mark. But any problem should have a solution, with often multiple aspects of solutions. Apart from medicine, one could become strengthened to face the situation. Starting with the analysis of the cause and the effect of Coronavirus Pandemic, this talk explores the intellectual and emotional aspects of the situation with the focus on the psychological and spiritual solutions to face the crisis; how to get reconciled with the reality; and how to thrive in his situation. The ultimate goal is to come out of the crisis with a spirit of creativity. If the pandemic is a period of cocoon, the butterfly-joy would be the hope to come out soon. And we need to stay energized to realize the fullness of life with peace of the mind, health of the body, and joy of the heart. Practical suggestions are put forward to face, encounter, and overcome the situation.

AB  - Telogen effluvium (TE), a common hair disease, is supposed to be related to stress, which could be secondary to poor sleep. We call attention to the current COVID-19 pandemic, that is leading to an increase in the prevalence of sleep disturbances, and as a consequence, higher states of stress and anxiety, which are possible triggers for TE. In parallel, trichodynia is a sensorial symptom that is commonly related with hair diseases, including TE. We argue that substance P, a neuropeptide that has participation in the neuroinflammation and also in the sleep regulation, may play a possible role in this scalp paresthesia. We suggest that there may be an association between this substrate and sleep, which can aggravate trichodynia and TE. Further studies on this subject could provide more evidence on these relationships, and help to improve the patients' quality of life and management of the condition.

AB  - The coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to all corners of the word, in a very complex manner. A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9-7 days, 4.41-8.4 days, 2.3-10 days and 4.4-7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread. Therefore, prevention and control institutions should be cautious when formulating public health strategies by based on the prediction results of mathematical models.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 epidemic is still expanding around the world and poses a serious threat to human life and health, it is necessary for us to carry out epidemic transmission prediction, whole genome sequence analysis, and public psychological stress assessment for 2019-nCoV. However, transmission prediction models are insufficiently accurate and genome sequence characteristics are not clear, and it is difficult to dynamically assess the public psychological stress state under the 2019-nCoV epidemic. Therefore, this study develops a 2019nCoVAS web service (http://www.combio-lezhang.online/2019ncov/home.html) that not only offers online epidemic transmission prediction and lineage-associated underrepresented permutation (LAUP) analysis services to investigate the spreading trends and genome sequence characteristics, but also provides psychological stress assessments based on such an emotional dictionary that we built for 2019-nCoV. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings and further study of the 2019nCoVAS web service.

AB  - The pandemic of COVID-19 has caused global social impact and high health risk. Clinical observations have suggested that elevated levels of inflammatory mediators are associated with disease severities in COVID-19 patients, in which the immunological profiles indicate the hyperactivation of innate immune cells and dysregulated adaptive immune responses. The increasing prevalence and disease progression of COVID-19 has emerged as a pressing challenge for the management of rheumatic patients with immune dysregulations. Here we review the immune dysregulations in COVID-19 and discuss the management of COVID-19 patients with rheumatic diseases.

AB  - Effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase that forms a dimer and serves as the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 is also a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates vascular functions. We report here the properties of a trimeric ACE2 ectodomain variant, engineered using a structure-based approach. The trimeric ACE2 variant has a binding affinity of ~60 pM for the spike protein of SARS‑CoV‑2 (compared with 77 nM for monomeric ACE2 and 12-22 nM for dimeric ACE2 constructs), and its peptidase activity and the ability to block activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 in the renin-angiotensin system are preserved. Moreover, the engineered ACE2 potently inhibits SARS‑CoV‑2 infection in cell culture. These results suggest that engineered, trimeric ACE2 may be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for treating COVID-19.

AB  - Background: It is of paramount importance to understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools, which could support the decision-making about educational facilities closure or re-opening with effective prevention and control measures in place. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: 2178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included. Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3345 contacts with 18 transmissions (overall infection attack rate (IAR): 0.08%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.00%-0.86%). IARs for students and school staff were 0.15% (95% CI = 0.00%-0.93%) and 0.70% (95% CI = 0.00%-3.56%) respectively. Six cross-sectional studies reported 639 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 6682 study participants tested [overall SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate: 8.00% (95% CI = 2.17%-16.95%). SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was estimated to be 8.74% (95% CI = 2.34%-18.53%) among students, compared to 13.68% (95% CI = 1.68%-33.89%) among school staff. Gender differences were not found for secondary infection (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.50-4.14, P = 0.49) and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.72-1.13, P = 0.36) in schools. Fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, rhinitis, sore throat, headache, myalgia, asthenia, and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (based on two studies). Overall, study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias, limiting the confidence in the results. Conclusions: There is limited high-quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission. Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff. Future prospective and adequately controlled cohort studies are necessary to confirm this finding.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to health care globally, and individuals with bipolar disorder are likely disproportionally affected. Based on review of literature and collective clinical experience, we discuss that without special intervention, individuals with bipolar disorder will experience poorer physical and mental health outcomes due to interplay of patient, provider and societal factors. Some risk factors associated with bipolar disorder, including irregular social rhythms, risk-taking behaviours, substantial medical comorbidities, and prevalent substance use, may be compounded by lockdowns, social isolation and decrease in preventive and maintenance care. We further discuss implications for clinical research of bipolar disorders during the pandemic. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies on working with individuals with bipolar disorder in a clinical and research context, focusing on digital medicine strategies to improve quality of and accessibility to service.

AB  - Epidemic outbreak (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) is an exceptional scenario of agri-food supply chain (AFSC) risk at the globalised level which is characterised by logistics' network breakdown (ripple effects), demand mismatch (uncertainty), and sustainable issues. Thus, the aim of this research is the modelling of the sustainable based multi-tier system for AFSC, which is managed through the different emerging application of Internet of things (IoT) technology. Different IoT technologies, viz., Blockchain, robotics, Big data analysis, and cloud computing, have developed a competitive AFSC at the global level. Competitive AFSC needs cautious incorporation of multi-tiers suppliers, specifically during dealing with globalised sustainability issues. Firms have been advancing towards their multi suppliers for driving social, environments and economical practices. This paper also studies the interrelationship of 14 enablers and their cause and effect magnitude as contributing to IoT-based food secure model. The methodology used in the paper is interpretative structural modelling (ISM) for establishing interrelationship among the enablers and Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to provide the magnitude of the cause-effect strength of the hierarchical framework. This paper also provides some theoretical contribution supported by information processing theory (IPT) and dynamic capability theory (DCT). This paper may guide the organisation's managers in their strategic planning based on enabler's classification into cause and effect groups. This paper may also encourage the mangers for implementing IoT technologies in AFSC.

AB  - The whole world is battling through coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is a fatal pandemic. In the early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global health emergency without definitive treatments and preventive approaches. In the absence of definitive therapeutic agents, this thorough review summarizes and outlines the potency and safety of all molecules and therapeutics which may have potential antiviral effects. A number of molecules and therapeutics licensed or being tested for some other conditions were found effective in different in vitro studies as well as in many small sample-sized clinical trials and independent case studies. However, in those clinical trials, there were some limitations which need to be overcome to find the most promising antiviral against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In conclusion, many of above-mentioned antivirals seems to have some therapeutic effects but none of them have been shown to have a strong evidence for their proper recommendation and approval in the treatment of COVID-19. Constantly evolving new evidences, exclusive adult data, language barrier, and type of study (observational, retrospective, small-sized clinical trials, or independent case series) resulted to the several limitations of this review. The need for multicentered, large sample-sized, randomized, placebo-controlled trials on COVID-19 patients to reach a proper conclusion on the most promising antiviral agent is warranted.

AB  - Most clinical research stopped during COVID due to possible impact on data quality and personnel safety. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID on acute stroke clinical trial conduct at sites that continued to enroll patients during the pandemic. BEST-MSU is an ongoing study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) vs standard management of tPA-eligible acute stroke patients in the pre-hospital setting. MSU personnel include a vascular neurologist via telemedicine, and a nurse, CT technologist, paramedics and emergency medicine technicians on-board. During COVID, consent, 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and EQ5D were obtained by phone instead of in-person, but other aspects of management were similar to the pre-COVID period. We compared patient demographics, study metrics, and infection of study personnel during intra- vs pre-COVID eras. Five of 6 BEST-MSU sites continued to enroll during COVID. There were no differences in intra- (n = 57) vs pre- (n = 869) COVID enrolled tPA eligible patients' age, sex, race (38.6% vs 38.0% Black), ethnicity (15.8% vs 18.6% Hispanic), or NIHSS (median 11 vs 9). The percent of screened patients enrolled and adjudicated tPA eligible declined from 13.6% to 6.6% (p < .001); study enrollment correlated with local stay-at-home and reopening orders. There were no differences in alert to MSU arrival or arrival to tPA times, but MSU on-scene time was 5 min longer (p = .01). There were no differences in ED door to CT, tPA treatment or thrombectomy puncture times, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or remote vs in-person 90-day mRS or EQ5D. One MSU nurse tested positive but did not require hospitalization. Clinical research in the pre-hospital setting can be carried out accurately and safely during a pandemic. tPA eligibility rates declined, but otherwise there were no differences in patient demographics, deterioration of study processes, or serious infection of study staff. Trial registration: NCT02190500.

AB  - Background: Previous researches on the association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use and the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 have generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this Meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the outcome in patients who take PPIs. Methods: We carried out a systematic search to identify potential studies until November 2020. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses and tests for publication bias were also performed. Results: Eight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95%CI = 0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11). While it can add risk of severe disease (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.20-1.99, P&lt;0.001;) and secondary infection (OR=4.33, 95% CI=2.57-7.29). No publication bias was detected. Conclusions: PPI use is not associated with increased risk infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection. However, more original studies to further clarify the relationship between PPI and COVID-19 are still urgently needed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding support for this workAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This is a meta-analysis and ethics committee approvals are not applicable here.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - As the situation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still deteriorating, there has been a huge increase in the demand and use of disinfectants. Electrolyzed water (EW), as a novel broad-spectrum disinfectant and cleaner, has been widely used for several years. EW can be produced in an electrolysis chamber which contains dilute salt and tap water. It is an effective antimicrobial and antibiofilm agent, with several advantages such as on-the-spot, cheap, environmentally friendly and safe for human beings. Therefore, EW holds potential significance for high-risk settings in hospitals and other clinical facilities. EW can also be applied for wound healing, advanced tissue care, and dental clinics. The present review article highlights the latest developments and new perspectives of EW, especially in clinical fields. Furthermore, the main action modes of antibiofilm and antimicrobial will be summarized.

AB  - The symptoms of the COVID-19 range from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe disease that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and eventually death. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the progression from mild to severe disease is the key to decreasing the mortality of COVID-19. Compared to mild cases, severe cases of the COVID-19 have decreased interferon (IFN) α, β, λ production. Type I (IFN α/β) and III IFNs (λ) work coordinately to induce inhibition of viral reproduction through the stimulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Failure to mount an IFN response leads to suboptimal activation of adaptive immune response and increased viral load. The increased viral load causes severe tissue damage, inducing a late wave of IFNs and an exacerbated inflammatory response. There are two known risk factors associated with severe disease- obesity and aging. Both lead to the activation of inflammasome NLRP3, which stimulates transcription factor NFκB and the production of inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFNs inhibit activation of NRLP3. Taken together, an early deficient IFN response and the following hyperinflammatory state are the hallmarks of severe COVID-19. This suggests that both type I and III IFNs could potentially be beneficial as prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 at the early stage of infection. Indeed, clinical studies have shown benefit of IFN Is, and there are ongoing trials testing type III IFNs for the treatment of COVID-19. Another strategy is to use hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to inhibit the viral entry into the cells. Our reanalysis of the results from two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) has concluded that use of HCQ is beneficial in postexposure prophylaxis. These two strategies can have great potential in the current pandemic of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world. In addition to common respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever, some patients also have cardiac injury, however, the mechanism of cardiac injury is not clear. In this study, we analyzed the RNA expression atlases of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin L (CTSL) in the human embryonic heart at single-cell resolution. RESULTS: The results showed that ACE2 was preferentially enriched in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, serine protease transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) had less expression in cardiomyocytes, but CTSB and CTSL, which belonged to cell protease, could be found to be enriched in cardiomyocytes. The results of enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ACE2-positive cardiomyocytes were mainly enriched in the processes of cardiac muscle contraction, regulation of cardiac conduction, mitochondrial respiratory chain, ion channel binding, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and viral transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that both atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes are potentially susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), and SARS-CoV-2 may enter ventricular cardiomyocytes using CTSB/CTSL for S protein priming. This may be the partial cellular mechanism of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has so far affected more than 45 million people and has caused over 1 million deaths worldwide. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic agent, which is associated with an imbalanced redox status, causes hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm, leading to cell death. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient individuals may experience a hemolytic crisis after being exposed to oxidants or infection. Individuals with G6PD deficiency are more susceptible to coronavirus infection than individuals with normally functioning G6PD. An altered immune response to viral infections is found in individuals with G6PD deficiency. Evidence indicates that G6PD deficiency is a predisposing factor of COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the ongoing global pandemic. Although most patients experience no or only mild symptoms, some patients can develop severe illness, such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and multiple organ failure caused by cytokine release syndrome. A majority of COVID-19 patients also develop gastrointestinal symptoms. These can present special challenges to the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to potential interactions between the immune response related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and dysregulated immunity associated with IBD. In this context, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is reviewed in order to address these questions regarding immune interactions between COVID-19 and IBD.

AB  - Microbes play important roles in human health and disease. The interaction between microbes and hosts is a reciprocal relationship, which remains largely under-explored. Current computational resources lack manually and consistently curated data to connect metagenomic data to pathogenic microbes, microbial core genes, and disease phenotypes. We developed the MicroPhenoDB database by manually curating and consistently integrating microbe-disease association data. MicroPhenoDB provides 5677 non-redundant associations between 1781 microbes and 542 human disease phenotypes across more than 22 human body sites. MicroPhenoDB also provides 696,934 relationships between 27,277 unique clade-specific core genes and 685 microbes. Disease phenotypes are classified and described using the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO). A refined score model was developed to prioritize the associations based on evidential metrics. The sequence search option in MicroPhenoDB enables rapid identification of existing pathogenic microbes in samples without running the usual metagenomic data processing and assembly. MicroPhenoDB offers data browsing, searching, and visualization through user-friendly web interfaces and web service application programming interfaces. MicroPhenoDB is the first database platform to detail the relationships between pathogenic microbes, core genes, and disease phenotypes. It will accelerate metagenomic data analysis and assist studies in decoding microbes related to human diseases. MicroPhenoDB is available through http://www.liwzlab.cn/microphenodb and http://lilab2.sysu.edu.cn/microphenodb.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The testes are suspected target organs of SARS-CoV-2. However, the results of studies on the effect of COVID-19 on male reproduction are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current research on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproduction. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was performed using PubMed and Ovid Embase up to August 18, 2020. Research articles on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, the effects of the virus on semen parameters, and any pathological changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Six of 176 survivors (3.4%) and 1 of 13 decedents (7.7%) in 2 of 12 studies were positive for viral RNA in semen and testicular tissue, respectively. After stratification of patient groups, we found that the virus was detected in the relatively early stage of infection, 6-16 days after disease onset, in semen from survivors. Two of 3 studies reported that some participants had substandard semen quality after COVID-19, and 1 study found that COVID-19 may impair semen quality in a severity-related manner. Pathological analyses showed that injuries to the seminiferous tubule occurred in all decedents (N=11). Another study found that orchitic and testis fibrin microthrombi occurred in patients with fatal disease (100%, N=2). Scrotal discomfort of orchiepididymitis or spermatic cord inflammation has also been reported in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Current studies suggest that semen is rarely considered a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material during the infection period but not in the semen of recovered patients. Fatal COVID-19 may cause testicular structure damage without the presence of virus.

AB  - Ocular complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) do not essentially cause serious visual loss. However, due to the characteristics of this disease, delays in diagnosis and treatment in hospitalized patients may leave them with serious visual impairment. If conjunctivitis is suspected, ophthalmological follow-up is needless because it is expected spontaneous healing. Diplopia is often complicated for extra-ocular neurological findings and need neurological consults. Ophthalmologists should be consulted for ocular surface disease, high intraocular pressure, and ocular inflammation that may cause visual loss if patients complain of blurred vision, visual loss, and ocular pain. The problem is unconscious patients with risk of developing high intraocular pressure or keratitis. An ophthalmologist should be consulted as soon as possible if eye redness or pupil abnormalities appear in these patients. We developed a flowchart for ophthalmic consultations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, for facilities where an ophthalmologist is not always present, and for third or fourth waves or, a pandemic of another infectious disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 has been increasingly recognized. However, the clinical features of MIS-C and the differences from Kawasaki disease remain unknown. The study aims to investigate the epidemiology and clinical course of MIS-C. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched through August 30, 2020. Observational studies describing MIS-C were included. Data regarding demographic features, clinical symptoms, laboratory, echocardiography and radiology findings, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were identified including 917 MIS-C patients. The mean age was 9.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-10.1). The pooled proportions of Hispanic and Black cases were 34.6% (95% CI, 28.3-40.9) and 31.5% (95% CI, 24.8-38.1), respectively. The common manifestations were gastrointestinal symptoms (87.3%; 95% CI, 82.9-91.6) and cardiovascular involvement such as myocardial dysfunction (55.3%; 95% CI, 42.4-68.2), coronary artery aneurysms (21.7%; 95% CI, 12.8-30.1) and shock (65.8%; 95% CI, 51.1-80.4), with marked elevated inflammatory and cardiac markers. The majority of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (81.0%; 95% CI, 75.0-86.9), aspirin (67.3%; 95% CI, 48.8-85.7), and corticosteroids (63.6%; 95% CI, 53.4-73.8) with a variety of anti-inflammatory agents. Although myocardial dysfunction improved in 55.1% (95% CI, 33.4-76.8) at discharge, the rate of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was 6.3% (95% CI, 2.8-9.8) and the mortality was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.0-2.8). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C leads to multiple organ failure, including gastrointestinal manifestations, myocardial dysfunction and coronary abnormalities, and has distinct features from Kawasaki disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the USA continues to rise, so does the popularity of diabetes management devices such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps. The use of this technology has been shown to improve outpatient glycemic outcomes and quality of life and oftentimes may be continued in the hospital setting. Our aim is to review the current guidelines and available evidence on the continuation of insulin pumps and CGMs in the inpatient setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with diabetes are at higher risk for hospitalizations and complications due to hyper- or hypoglycemia, metabolic co-morbidities, or as seen recently, more severe illness from infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The maintenance of euglycemia is important to decrease both morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting. There is consensus among experts and medical societies that inpatient use of diabetes technology in carefully selected patients with proper institutional protocols is safe and can improve inpatient glycemic outcomes and reduce hypoglycemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGMs played a vital role in managing hyperglycemia in some hospitalized patients. Insulin pumps and CGMs have the potential to transform glycemic management in hospitalized patients. In order for institutions to safely and effectively incorporate these technologies on their inpatient units, hospital-based providers will need to be able to understand how to manage and utilize these devices in their practice in conjunction with diabetes experts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic underscored our healthcare system's unpreparedness to manage an unprecedented pandemic. Heart failure (HF) physicians from 14 different academic and private practice centers share their systems' challenges and innovations to care for patients with HF, heart transplantation, and patients on LVAD support during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss measures implemented to alleviate the fear in seeking care, ensure continued optimization of guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT), manage the heart transplant waiting list, continue essential outpatient monitoring of anticoagulation in LVAD patients and surveillance testing post-heart transplant, and prevent physician burnout. This collaborative work can build a foundation for better preparation in the face of future challenges.

AB  - Breast complaints are a very common cause of healthcare visits in the female population. They range in severity from benign to malignant, and treatment options vary from simple observation to mastectomy. As healthcare facilities are overburdened with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, properly triaging patients diagnosed with breast disorders is necessary for the optimal use of limited resources in developing countries. We are proposing a concise triage system for timely intervention among patients with breast disorders during the havoc of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is one of the beta-coronaviruses with the spike protein. It invades host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This newly discovered virus can result in excessive inflammation and immune pathological damage, as shown by a decreased number of peripheral lymphocytes, increased levels of cytokines, and damages of lung, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs. Effective therapeutic modalities such as new antiviral drugs and vaccines against this emerging virus need to be thoroughly studied and developed. However, so far the only recognized but mild progress in this area is the screening of old drugs for new uses. Therefore, rapid and accurate laboratory SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches are the important basis of identification and blockage of COVID-19 transmission. For COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications (mild, common, severe, and critically severe), dynamic monitoring of functional indicators of susceptible and vital organs is an important strategy for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. In this review, we summarized SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic schemes, pathophysiological indices of tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, and laboratory diagnostic strategies for distinct disease stages. Further, we discussed the importance of hierarchical management and dynamic observation in SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics. We then summed up the advance in SARS-CoV-2 testing technology and described the prospect of intelligent medicine in the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: China is at the forefront of global efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines and has five fast-tracked candidates in the final-stage, large scale human clinical trials tests. Layered on top of public engagement, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the context of COVID-19 vaccination promotion. OBJECTIVE: In this study, public opinions in China are analyzed via public dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which the views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination of Chinese netizens are investigated. We recommend strategies for promoting vaccination programs in the most populous country based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilizations. METHODS: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model SRS/I to analyze the opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with meta-analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinion is examined in contexts. RESULTS: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October in 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R_0), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three-stage: the Ferment period (R_0,1.1360), the Evolution period (R_0, 2.8278) and the Transmission period (R_0, 3.0729). Significantly, the topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China are emerging from the landscape of public opinion transmissions, such as price, side effects, and the like. From September to October, the Weibos claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, occupied 18.3%, and received 38.1% Likes in Weibo's relevant topics. On the contrary, the number of Weibos which considered the vaccine reasonably priced is twice that of the former, but it received less amount of Likes, accounting for 25.0%. The emotional polarity of netizens in terms of side effects is another aspect of our research. We obtained 47.7% positive and 31.9% negative Weibos about side effects, respectively. One intriguing phenomenon we also captured in this research is that the inactivated vaccines aroused much more heated discussion than any other vaccine type. The Discussions, Forwards, Comments, and Likes from the topics of inactivated vaccines respectively account for 53%, 42%, 56%, and 49% of those from the five types of vaccine development in China. CONCLUSIONS: Most Chinese believe that the vaccine is cheaper than previously thought, while some claim they could not afford it for their entire family. The Chinese are inclined to be positive to side effects over time and proud of China's development regarding vaccines. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. Reflecting on those collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policy-makings.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis, and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from smokers, non-smokers, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer. An exhaustive search of the GEO database was performed to identify eligible data on 1st June 2020. In total, 46 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3,053 samples were identified as eligible data for further analysis. All meta-analysis were performed using RStudio. Standardized mean difference was utilized to assess the effect size of a factor on the expression of targeted genes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. This study revealed that (i) cigarette smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; (ii) significant alternations in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L were observed between current smokers and former smokers, but not between former smokers and never smokers; (iii) when compared with healthy controls with identical smoking status, patients with COPD or lung cancer showed negligible changes in expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. Therefore, this study implicates cigarette smoking might contribute to the development of COVID-19 by affecting the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes, while smoking cessation could be effective to reduce the potential risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a worldwide public health emergency that has put great pressure on medical workers and the medical system. General Practitioners (GPs) played an important role in controlling the epidemic, and GP trainees also took an active part in this approach. This study was to explore Chinese GP trainees' career perspectives after COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study which included 12 GP trainees from three teaching hospitals in China. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted. Grounded theory and thematic analysis were used to code the data and identify categories and factors. RESULTS: Eleven participants chose to continue a GP career after COVID-19, and nearly half of the participants strengthened their determination to dedicate themselves to this career. Only one participant decided to change the career choice because of interest in another specialty. Four main themes influencing GP trainees' perceptions of career development after COVID-19 emerged from the interviews: changes of GPs' work content in COVID-19, challenges of being a GP, psychological changes of the career, how to provide better primary care. Although some negative psychological changes existed, most of participants were inspired by role models and medical colleagues. They had more in-depth understanding of GPs' role and responsibility during COVID-19, and exhibited intensions for self-improvement in career development, especially in public health education and self-protection in preventing infectious diseases. In addition, the wide use of telemedicine provided a new work way for GP trainees. However, challenges, such as increased workloads, low income, lack of resources in primary medical institutions, and distrust of GPs are faced by trainees during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no substantial changes were seen in the career choice of GP trainees after COVID-19 outbreak. However, they were inspired and had an in-depth understanding about the GP's work and responsibility during an epidemic. Owing to the challenges faced by the GPs, measures are needed to improve the GP education and work environment in the training phase.

AB  - Recent studies have profiled the innate immune signatures in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and suggest that cellular responses to viral challenge may affect disease severity. Yet the molecular events that underlie cellular recognition and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 replication induces a delayed interferon (IFN) response in lung epithelial cells. By screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing. Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-κB/p65 are the key transcription factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, these findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of the innate immune recognition and signaling response to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Introduction: Vitamin D status is related to risks of influenza and respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D has direct antiviral effects primarily against enveloped viruses, and coronavirus is an enveloped virus. The 2019 coronavirus disease had a high mortality rate and impacted the whole population of the planet, with severe acute respiratory syndrome the principal cause of death. Vitamin D can adequately modulate and regulate the immune and oxidative response to infection with COVID-19. The goal of this systematic review was thus to summarize and decide if there were a link between vitamin D status and COVID-19 infection and prognosis. Methods: The protocol of this study is documented in the Prospero database and can be accessed with the protocol number CRD42020201283. PubMed and Google Scholar were used for a literature search from August 2020 to September 2020. We restricted the year of publication of reviewed articles to 2019-2020, and the selected language was English. Studies that used secondary data, feedback, or analysis of reviews were removed. To assess the standard of studies included, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was used. Results: Of the nine studies reviewed, seven (77.8%) showed that COVID-19 infection, prognosis, and mortality were correlated with vitamin D status. Conclusion: Most of the articles reviewed showed that blood vitamin D status can determine the risk of being infected with COVID-19, seriousness of COVID-19, and mortality from COVID-19. Therefore, maintaining appropriate levels of Vitamin D through supplementation or natural methods, eg, sunlight on the skin, is recommended for the public to be able to cope with the pandemic.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a sense of global panic and the medical community started to search for rapid answers. Pharmaceuticals and research labs across the world are racing to find vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technological ways. With Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is observed that asymptomatic symptoms turn out to be severe and fatal. By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. The aim of this article is to discuss the potential effect of MSCs types in COVID-19 infection without definite treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite having prevented public health center (PHC) dysfunction in response to COVID-19 during the first wave, public health nurses (PHNs) who play a central role in preventing COVID-19 and supporting community people were unable to share practical knowledge with other PHNs immediately. This report aims to introduce the development of novel sustainable public health care systems with regard to COVID-19 in Japan: task sharing, securing staff, and task shifting. METHODS: A descriptive study. The Japan Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare enlisted good practices regarding resource allocation and developing full readiness for sustainable public health care systems in September 2020. RESULTS: Public health center developed systems for office support, infection control, hospital coordination, and outsourced inventory control. To reduce the workload of PHNs, a support team of three to four office workers developed a response manual for residents and a format for telephone consultations regarding COVID-19. Developing an infection control team and web-based system for hospital coordination decreased the workload of PHCs in each community to prepare for the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Public health center should consider managing limited human resources and focus on providing specialized care for COVID-19 patients. Task sharing, securing staff, and task shifting are crucial strategies for developing sustainable public health care systems.

AB  - Despite widespread national, state, and local guidelines for COVID-19 prevention, including social distancing and mask orders, many people continue to not adhere to recommendations, including congregating in groups for non-essential activities, putting themselves and others at risk. A social psychological perspective can be used to understand reasons for lack of adherence to policies and methods for increasing adherence based on successes from other behavior change campaigns. This manuscript seeks to describe some of the social psychological research that may be relevant to COVID-19 prevention and behavior change, describe how these theories have been previously applied in various domains to change behavior, and provide examples of how these approaches might be similarly applied to control the pandemic. We provide concrete examples of actions that can be taken based on social psychological research that might help to increase adherence to COVID-19 recommendations and improve prevention and control of the virus.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the sixth international public health emergency. While COVID-19 classically manifests as a respiratory illness, SARS-CoV-2 may infect multiple organ systems and cause a wide array of presentations. The gastrointestinal tract has become increasingly recognized as a site of SARS-CoV-2 infection with reports of diarrhea, nausea, and liver failure, with or without concomitant respiratory involvement. In this case series and literature review, we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients that presented with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms or laboratory abnormalities such as diarrhea, anorexia, and transaminitis. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as the necessary protease to facilitate viral entry, transmembrane protease serine-2 (TMPRSS2), and to a lesser extent, cathepsins, have been demonstrated to be present throughout the gastrointestinal tract, thus facilitating viral entry and pathogenesis. Furthermore, multiple reports have demonstrated evidence of viral shedding outside the nasopharynx, including the stool, for prolonged time periods even in the absence of detection of viral RNA in the nasopharynx. As such, testing for SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for detection of viral RNA could aid in identifying patients that lack classic respiratory symptoms, present with atypical symptoms, or in those with a high index of suspicion (e.g. elevated inflammatory markers), but test negative on the classic nasopharyngeal swab. Furthermore, this underscores the potential for atypical transmission, with a focus on fecal-oral transmission and the need for strict hand hygiene.

AB  - COVID-19 has widely spread across the world, and much research is being conducted on the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. To help control the infection, we developed the Coronavirus GenBrowser (CGB) to monitor the pandemic. CGB allows visualization and analysis of the latest viral genomic data. Distributed genome alignments and an evolutionary tree built on the existing subtree are implemented for easy and frequent updates. The tree-based data are compressed at a ratio of 2,760:1, enabling fast access and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CGB can effectively detect adaptive evolution of specific alleles, such as D614G of the spike protein, in their early stage of spreading. By lineage tracing, the most recent common ancestor, dated in early March 2020, of nine strains collected from six different regions in three continents was found to cause the outbreak in Xinfadi, Beijing, China in June 2020. CGB also revealed that the first COVID-19 outbreak in Washington State was caused by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To encourage data sharing, CGB credits the person who first discovers any SARS-CoV-2 variant. As CGB is developed with eight different languages, it allows the general public in many regions of the world to easily access pre-analyzed results of more than 132,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. CGB is an efficient platform to monitor adaptive evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by a grant from the National Key Research and Development Project (No. 2020YFC0847000).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:N/AAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began as a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China before spreading to over 200 countries and territories on six continents in less than six months. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts to limit the transmission of the virus, COVID-19 cases and deaths have continued to increase, leaving devastating impacts on the lives of many with far-reaching effects on the global society, economy and healthcare system. With over 43 million cases and 1.1 million deaths recorded worldwide, accurate and rapid diagnosis continues to be a cornerstone of pandemic control. In this review, we aim to present an objective overview of the latest nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 that have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) as of 31 October 2020. We systematically summarize and compare the principles, technologies, protocols and performance characteristics of amplification- and sequencing-based tests that have become alternatives to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. We highlight the notable features of the tests including authorized settings, along with the advantages and disadvantages of the tests. We conclude with a brief discussion on the current challenges and future perspectives of COVID-19 diagnostics.

AB  - Conventional reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technology has struggled to fulfill the unprecedented need for diagnostic testing created by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Complexity and cost hinder access to testing, and long turnaround-time decreases its utility. To ameliorate these issues, we focus on saliva and introduce several advances to colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technology; RT-LAMP offers a minimal equipment alternative to RT-qPCR. First, we validated the use of the novel dye LAMPShade Violet (LSV), which improves the visual clarity and contrast of the colorimetric readout. Second, we compared different inactivation conditions on infectivity and RNA yield from saliva. Third, we developed a ten-minute RNA purification protocol from saliva. We call this magnetic bead protocol SalivaBeads. Finally, we developed a magnetic stick, StickLAMP, which provides reliable bead-based RNA purification as well as simple and low-cost access to scalable testing from saliva.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work is supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRB Protocol #20132R Rosbash: SARS-CoV-2 Testing Initiative The Brandeis IRB, operating under Federalwide Assurance #FWA00004408, has approved the above-referenced human subjects protocol by expedited review in accordance with 45 CFR 46.110 under category (3).All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing global threat. The elderly with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular and lung diseases, diabetes, obesity, are the most vulnerable to this disease. Curing the pre-existing health conditions will greatly increase a person's resilience to COVID-19 and lower the death rate of the old people. Digestion and immunity form an integrated nutrition acquisition process, especially in obtaining essential amino acids and essential fatty acids from living microbial cells. A mature strong immunity coupled with gut dysbiosis in adults is the main cause of nutritional disorders like morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Nutrition disorders in return worsen dysbiosis. Human microbiome has an intrinsic duality. While a diverse microbiome provides a full spectrum of essential nutrients to our body, nutrition disorders fuel overgrowth of microbiota (dysbiosis) at many sites on or inside our body, and are the main causes of chronic inflammation at these sites. In the case of COVID-19, nutritional disorder impairs the immunity, causes hyperinflammation, and leads to the protracted overload of cytokines by the immune system, i.e., the cytokine storm. Autophagy induced by restrictive eating is an ideal inhibitor of microbiota overgrowth, as autophagy deprives microbiota of excessive nutrition for replication. Autophagy also attenuates inflammation. Therefore, as a precaution, the author suggests restoring good health in the elderly with the support from a diverse gut microbiome and daily regular food intake restriction, so as to lower the risk of developing into severe case even if they are infected by COVID-19.

AB  - Carbon-based nanomaterials such as graphene and nanodiamonds have demonstrated impressive physical and chemical properties, such as remarkable strength, corrosion resistance, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, and stability. Because of these unique characteristics, carbon nanomaterials are explored in a wide range of fields, including the diagnosis and treatment of viruses. As there are emerging concerns about the control of virus including Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this review highlights the recent development of carbon based-nanomaterials for the management of viral infections.

AB  - Little is understood of the social and cultural effects of coronaviruses such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). This systematic review aims to synthesize existing findings (both qualitative and quantitative) that focus on the social and cultural impacts of coronaviruses in order to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a predetermined search strategy, we searched CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science to identify existing (qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods) studies pertaining to the coronavirus infections and their intersection with societies and cultures. A narrative synthesis approach was applied to summarize and interpret findings of the study. Stemming from SARS outbreak in 2003, qualitative and quantitative findings (twelve adopted quantitative methods and eight exclusively used qualitative methods) were organized under five topical domains: governance, crisis communication and public knowledge, stigma and discrimination, social compliance of preventive measures, and the social experience of health workers. The selected studies suggest that current societies are not equipped for effective coronavirus response and control. This mixed-methods systematic review demonstrates that the effects of coronaviruses on a society can be debilitating.

AB  - PURPOSE: The physician voice is crucial to shaping health policy and public health guidelines, particularly during COVID-19. However, there are gaps in health policy and advocacy education within graduate medical education. This study sought to characterise the impact of a virtual COVID-19 focused advocacy day among medical trainees in Massachusetts. STUDY DESIGN: The half-day event featured speakers drawn from government relations experts, physician advocates, and state and federal legislators as well as breakout discussions among attendees. A 25-question Redcap survey and list of resources/opportunities for continued advocacy was administered to all participants at event's conclusion on 19 May 2020. RESULTS: There were 60 responses from 141 participants (43% response rate). One-third reported no prior formal health policy instruction, and over half reported getting information from news publications, social media and peers. 58% believed physician involvement in advocacy to be 'extremely important' prior to COVID-19; 83% believed the same after onset of COVID-19 (p<0.0001). The most common barriers to advocacy engagement were lack of time and knowledge. Most attendees felt participation increased their knowledge and likelihood to engage in the COVID-19 response, imparted useful skills/knowledge for continued advocacy, increased their interest in future similar events, and that such events should be available to all trainees. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees recognise the importance of health policy and advocacy and value opportunities to gain the necessary skills/knowledge to effect tangible change. Virtual advocacy days can be replicated nationwide to help trainees learn about advocacy efforts and find their legislative voices during COVID-19 and beyond.

AB  - Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation is a unique post-translational modification that regulates many biological processes, such as DNA damage repair. During DNA repair, ADP-ribosylation needs to be reversed by ADP-ribosylhydrolases. A group of ADP-ribosylhydrolases have a catalytic domain, namely the macrodomain, which is conserved in evolution from prokaryotes to humans. Not all macrodomains remove ADP-ribosylation. One set of macrodomains loses enzymatic activity and only binds to ADP-ribose (ADPR). Here, we summarize the biological functions of these macrodomains in DNA damage repair and compare the structure of enzymatically active and inactive macrodomains. Moreover, small molecular inhibitors have been developed that target macrodomains to suppress DNA damage repair and tumor growth. Macrodomain proteins are also expressed in pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, these domains may not be directly involved in DNA damage repair in the hosts or pathogens. Instead, they play key roles in pathogen replication. Thus, by targeting macrodomains it may be possible to treat pathogen-induced diseases, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AB  - With many employees returning to work after lockdowns and quarantines in the current COVID-19 pandemic, research that seeks to identify effective ways to help them regain focus at work is warranted. However, the small body of applied psychology literature on large-scale disruptive events has paid insufficient attention to this important topic. Further, different from acute events (e.g., disasters), the ongoing pandemic poses an additional challenge for organizations as they seek to effectively protect employees' job engagement from health and safety threats in the workplace. To address these gaps, we drew from job reattachment research and investigated it as an important antecedent of job engagement for employees returning to work. Moreover, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a moderator that can strengthen the effectiveness of job reattachment in enhancing job engagement. We further linked engagement to work withdrawal, use of personal protective equipment (e.g., wearing a mask), and task performance to underscore the downstream implications of job reattachment. To test our research model, we collected multiwave, multisource data from the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic-Wuhan, China-where many employees were returning to work. The results provide strong support for our model. In addition to extending research on large-scale disruptive events, the current study has important implications for organizations and employees in the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) treatment is considered an effective decontamination approach to address the supply shortage of N95 FFRs during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigated the nanomechanical and topographic properties of filtration fibers that have been exposed to different doses of UVC radiation. UVC exposure was shown to decrease both Young's modulus (E), hardness (H) and fiber width, as measured on individual polypropylene (PP) fibers. Our results also show that the PP microfiber layer loses its strength when N95 respirators are exposed to an accumulated UVC dose during the process of decontamination, and the PP fiber width also exhibits a logarithmic decrease during UVC exposure. The nanoscale measurement results on individual fibers suggest that maximum cycles of UVC disinfection treatment should be limited due to excessive accumulated dose, which has the potential to decrease the fiber breaking strength.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has taken a significant toll on people and countries all over the world. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been completely elucidated yet. This includes the interplay between inflammation and coagulation which needs further investigation. The massive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines results in the so-called cytokine storm, leading to plasma leakage, vascular hyperpermeability, and disseminated vascular coagulation. This is usually accompanied by multiorgan failure. The extensive changes in the serum levels of cytokines are thought to play a crucial role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Additionally, the viral load and host inflammation factors are believed to have a significant role in host damage, particularly lung damage, from SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, patients exhibit quantitative and qualitative differences in their immune responses to the virus, which can impact the clinical manifestation and outcomes of COVID-19. There needs to be a better understanding of the dynamic events that involve immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and viral replication in the context of the COVID-19 infection. Here, we discuss the main aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis while supporting the hypothesis that inflammatory immune responses are involved in the progression of the disease to a more critical and fatal phase. We also explore the similarities and differences between severe COVID-19 and sepsis. A deeper understanding of the COVID-19 clinical picture as it relates to better-known conditions such as sepsis can provide useful clues for the management, prevention, and therapy of the disease.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe illness leading to pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. With this study, we performed a systematic review of the literature and ongoing clinical trials on convalescent plasma therapy in pediatric patients with COVID-19. The electronic databases Medline PubMed, Scopus, and Web Of Science were searched. Also, clinical trials registries were searched for potentially eligible studies. A total of 90 records were retrieved after duplicate removal. Eight studies were case reports of children treated with convalescent plasma therapy (14 children, age range, 9 weeks to 18 years); 5 children had a chronic disease. During the hospital stay, 5 received drugs (e.g., remdesivir) in addition to convalescent plasma therapy. No convalescent plasma therapy-related adverse events were reported in 5 studies and 3 made no mention of adverse events. Seven studies concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is or could be a useful therapeutic option; one study made no claims. Only 3 of the 13 retrieved trials underway were planned exclusively for children. This is the first systematic review of the literature regarding convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in children. We found insufficient clinical information on the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in children. Nevertheless, the positive outcomes of the few case reports published to date suggest that convalescent plasma therapy may be of potential benefit. Further research with well-designed and powered clinical trials is needed.

AB  - Waterborne diseases are a major global problem, resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and massive economic costs. The ability to rapidly and reliably detect and monitor the spread of waterborne diseases is vital for early intervention and preventing more widespread disease outbreaks. Pathogens are, however, difficult to detect in water and are not practicably detectable at acceptable concentrations that need to be achieved in treated drinking water (which are of the order one per million litre). Furthermore, current clinical-based surveillance methods have many limitations such as the invasive nature of the testing and the challenges in testing large numbers of people. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which is based on the analysis of wastewater to monitor the emergence and spread of infectious disease at a population level, has received renewed attention in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present review will focus on the application of WBE for the detection and surveillance of pathogens with a focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the waterborne protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The review highlights the benefits and challenges of WBE and the future of this tool for community-wide infectious disease surveillance.

AB  - COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered enveloped virus (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and affected the whole world. The infected individual may develop symptoms such as high fever, cough, myalgia, lymphopenia, respiratory distress syndrome etc. or remain completely asymptomatic after the incubation period of two to fourteen days. As the virus is transmitted by inhaling infectious respiratory droplets that are produced by sneezing or coughing, so early and rapid diagnosis of the disease can prevent infection and transmission. In the current pandemic situation, the medical industry is looking for new technologies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19. In this context, the current review article highlights the Artificial Intelligence methods that are playing an effective role in rapid, accurate and early diagnosis of the disease via pattern recognition, machine learning, expert system and fuzzy logic by improving cognitive behavior and reducing human error. Auto-encoder deep learning method, α-satellite, ACEMod and heterogeneous graph auto-encoder are AI approaches that determine the transfer rate of virus and are helpful in shaping public health and planning. In addition, CT scan, X-ray, MRI, and RT-PCR are some of the techniques that are being employed in the identification of COVID-19. We hope using AI techniques, the world can emerge from COVID-19 pandemic while mitigating social and economic crisis.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, thousands of scientists around the globe have changed research direction to understand better how the virus works and to find out how it may be tackled. The number of manuscripts on preprint servers is soaring and peer-reviewed publications using MS-based proteomics are beginning to emerge. To facilitate proteomic research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, this report presents deep-scale proteomes (10,000 proteins; >130,000 peptides) of common cell line models, notably Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, and ACE2-A549 that characterize their protein expression profiles including viral entry factors such as ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Using the 9 kDa protein SRP9 and the breast cancer oncogene BRCA1 as examples, we show how the proteome expression data can be used to refine the annotation of protein-coding regions of the African green monkey and the Vero cell line genomes. Monitoring changes of the proteome on viral infection revealed widespread expression changes including transcriptional regulators, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in innate immunity. Based on a library of 98 stable-isotope labeled synthetic peptides representing 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we developed PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) assays for nano-flow and micro-flow LC-MS/MS. We assessed the merits of these PRM assays using supernatants of virus-infected Vero E6 cells and challenged the assays by analyzing two diagnostic cohorts of 24 (+30) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 28 (+9) negative cases. In light of the results obtained and including recent publications or manuscripts on preprint servers, we critically discuss the merits of MS-based proteomics for SARS-CoV-2 research and testing.

AB  - Introduction: Zukamu granules may play a potential role in the fight against the Coronavirus, COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanisms of Zukamu granules using network pharmacology combined with molecular docking. Methods: The Traditional Chinese Medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to filter the active compounds and the targets of each drug in the prescription. The Genecards and OMIM databases were used for identifying the targets related to COVID-19. The STRING database was used to analyze the intersection targets. Compound - target interaction and protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape to decipher the anti-COVID-19 mechanisms of action of the prescription. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action. Finally, the interaction between the targets and the active compounds was verified by molecular docking technology. Results: A total of 66 targets were identified. Further analysis identified 10 most important targets and 12 key compounds. Besides, 1340 biological processes, 43 cell compositions, and 87 molecular function items were obtained (P < 0.05). One hundred and thirty pathways were obtained (P < 0.05). The results of molecular docking showed that there was a stable binding between the active compounds and the targets. Conclusion: Analysis of the constructed pharmacological network results allowed for the prediction and interpretation of the multi-constituent, multi-targeted, and multi-pathway mechanisms of Zukamu granules as a potential source for supportive treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, by the World Health Organization. The pandemic has had unprecedented worldwide implications, in particular on marginalized populations. AIMS: The aim of this study is to review the impact of the pandemic on patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: A number of databases were searched for this review, including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Search terms included psychosis and COVID-19, schizophrenia and COVID-19, and severe mental illness and COVID-19. We included all English language papers and preprints. The final search was done on 15 July 2020. RESULTS: Forty-seven relevant studies were identified and included in this review. Studies were summarised into five main subcategories: potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical health outcomes of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, impact on mental health outcomes, review of case reports and case series to date, treatment recommendation guidelines and risk of increased prevalence of psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This patient population has a number of risk factors, including psychosocial adversities and illness related factors. Continuous monitoring and long-term studies of the impact of the pandemic on this patient population are required.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, began in late 2019, has caused a worldwide pandemic and shows no signs of slowing. Glucocorticoids (GCs), including dexamethasone (DEX), have been widely used as effective anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs. In this study, seven GCs had no obvious effect on cell viability of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) high expressed HEK293T cells when concentrations were under 10 μM. Molecular docking results revealed that DEX occupied with active binding site of ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results showed that KD value between DEX and ACE2 was (9.03 ± 0.78) e-6 M. Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) results uncovered that DEX had a chromatographic retention. DEX was found out to inhibiting the viropexis into ACE2h cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. Therefore, DEX inhibits the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus into cell by binding to ACE2.

AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with strong contagion in the crowd, has ravaged worldwide and severely impacts the human health and epidemic prevention system, by producing a series of significant stress reactions in the body to induce further cytokine storm. Transcription factors (TFs) served as essential DNA binding proteins play an integral role in regulating cytokine storm, and the detection of it in the human coronavirus environment provides especially valuable approaches to diagnosis and treatment of 2019-nCoV and development of antiviral drugs. In this work, an entropy-driven electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was constructed for ultra-sensitive bioassay of NF-κB p50. The strategy primarily capitalizing the splendid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding properties of transcription factors, employing GOAu-Ru composite material as ECL emitter, utilizing entropy-driven reactions for signal amplification method, offered a repeatable proposal for TFs detection. In the absence of TFs, the released DNA1 further went in the entropy-driven reaction, contributing to an "ECL off" state. However, in the presence of TFs, the dsDNA avoided being digested, which blocked DNA1 for participating in the entropy-driven reaction, and the system exhibited an "ECL on" state. Most importantly, the ECL bioanalytical method denoted broad application prospects for NF-κB p50 detection with a lower detection limit (9.1 pM).

AB  - Purpose: Communities are central to the practice of public health emergency preparedness and response. This article mainly focuses on COVID-19 and discusses the formation and structure of community disaster resilience, which is an effective method for coping with such a public health emergency. Methods: Based on the management of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, this article uses Shanghai's experience to illustrate how a community disaster resilience was formed for risk management. Resorting to the analytical framework of risk city, principles of community disaster resilience are given. Results: Four actions can be recommended based on Shanghai's experience: 1) Applying a vulnerability analysis matrix for targeted risk governance, 2) empowering volunteer groups for emergency response, 3) policy and action for public health emergency prevention, and 4) risk communication for uncertainty-oriented planning. Conclusion: Shanghai's experience offers a reference to tackle the COVID-19 at the global level. The COVID-19 outbreak highlights that humans still face various unpredictable health risks in the future. Forming a connection-based resilience at the community level is an effective way to risk management.

AB  - Since December 2019, the pneumonia cases infected with 2019 novel coronavirus have appeared, posing a critical threat to global health. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to discover the different clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 to find the potential risk factors and predictors of this disease's severity, as well as to serve as a guidance for subsequent epidemic prevention and control work. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase and other databases were searched to collect studies on the difference of clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, and the funnel plots could be made to evaluate the publication bias. P>0.05 means no statistical significance. Furthermore, a meta-regression analysis was performed by using Stata 15.0 to find the potential factors of the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>50%). Sixteen studies have been included, with 1,172 severe patients and 2,803 non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have the symptoms of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and the complications of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury. Interestingly, the former smokers were more prevalent in severe cases as compared to non-severe cases, but there was no difference between the two groups of 'current smokers'. Except for chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease, the underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, cerebrovascular disease, and HIV can make the disease worse. In terms of laboratory indicators, the decreased lymphocyte and platelet count, and the increased levels of white blood cell (WBC), D-dimer, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were more prevalent in severe patients. Meta-regression analysis showed that patient age, gender, and proportion of severe cases did not significantly impact on the outcomes of any clinical indexes that showed high degree of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, the severity of COVID-19 could be evaluated by, radiologic finding, some symptoms like dyspnea and hemoptysis, some laboratory indicators, and smoking history, especially the ex-smokers. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have complications and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc., which were the risk factors for the disease to be severer, but the chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease were not associated the severity of COVID-19 in China.

AB  - Two outbreaks of severe respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused global pandemics and highlighted the importance of preparedness for respiratory CoVs. Recently, a third highly pathogenic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China and posed a public health crisis worldwide. Here, we focus on the recent advances of the novel CoV, and discuss its genomic similarity with other CoVs, transmission, animal model and clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by SARS-CoV-2, which help epidemic prevention and control, and guide treatment strategies.

AB  - Cryptosporidium parvum is a major zoonotic pathogen responsible for outbreaks of severe diarrhea in humans and calves. Almost all investigations of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks caused by C. parvum have focused on its IIa subtype family in industrialized nations. From December 2018 to April 2019, approximately 200 neonatal calves on a large cattle farm in Hebei Province, China were diagnosed with watery diarrhea and over 40 died. To investigate the cause of the outbreak fecal samples were taken during and after the outbreak from neonatal calves of ≤ 4 weeks of age (n = 40 and n = 56) and older calves of 4 - 24 weeks of age (n = 79 and n = 38). A total of 18 fecal samples collected from ill calves at the peak of the outbreak were analyzed for four common enteric pathogens using an enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In addition, 75 samples from neonatal calves were tested for rotavirus by EIA. All samples were analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp. using PCR and sequencing techniques. Of the initial 18 samples from sick calves, ten were positive for C. parvum, five for rotavirus, and one for coronavirus. The overall prevalence of rotavirus in neonatal calves was 20.0% (15/75), with no significant differences during and after the outbreak. In contrast, Cryptosporidium parvum infections were significantly higher during the outbreak (60.0%, 24/40) than after the outbreak (30.4%, 17/56; P = 0.004). Cryptosporidium parvum infection was associated with the presence of watery diarrhea in neonatal calves (OR = 11.19), while no association was observed between C. bovis infection and diarrhea. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA20G1. This is one of the few reports of outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IId subtypes in calves. More attention should be directed toward the dissemination of C. parvum in China.

AB  - Background: Value of radiomics features from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images for predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 has not been studied.Methods: A total of 1,245 patients(685 moderate and 560 severe patients)were enrolled in a retrospective study.We proposed 3D V-Net to segment adrenal glands in onset CT images automatically and periadrenal fat was obtained using inflation operation around the adrenal gland. Next, we built a clinical model(CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model[AM], periadrenal fat model[PM] and fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model[FM])and radiomics nomogram(RN)after radiomics features extracted to predict disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Results: The auto-segmentation framework yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set. CM, AM, PM, FM and RN obtained AUCs of 0.712, 0.692, 0.763, 0.791 and 0.806, respectively in the training set. FM and RN had better predictive efficacy than CM (P &lt; 0.0001) in the training set. RN showed that there was no significant difference in the validation set(mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.04) and test set (MAE = 0.075) between predictive and actual results. Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3 in the validation set or between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, it could gain more net benefits using RN than FM and CM. Conclusion: Radiomics features extracted from the adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images may predict progression in patients with COVID-19.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical Trial2020, NO.01Funding StatementThis study was supported Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province (QKHZC[2020]4Y002,QKHPTRC[2019]5803), the Guiyang Science and Technology Project (ZKXM[2020]4), Guizhou Science and Technology Department Key Lab.

AB  - Utilizing national migration data regarding the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), this paper employs a difference-in-differences approach to empirically analyze the relationship between human mobility and the transmission of infectious diseases in China. We show that national human mobility restrictions ascribed to the first-level public health emergency response policy effectively reduce both intercity and intracity migration intensities, thus leading to a declining scale of human mobility, which improves the effectiveness in controlling the epidemic. Human mobility restrictions have greater influences on cities with better economic development, denser populations, or larger passenger volumes. Moreover, mobility restriction measures are found to be better implemented in regions with increased public awareness, or with provincial leaders who have healthcare crisis management experience, local administrative experience, or the opportunity to serve a consecutive term.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are an option for drug development for treating COVID-19. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two groups of mouse neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. MAbs 2H2 and 3C1, representing the two antibody groups, respectively, bind distinct epitopes and are compatible in formulating a noncompeting antibody cocktail. A humanized version of the 2H2/3C1 cocktail is found to potently neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 12 ng/mL and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2-infected mice even when administered at as late as 24 h post-infection. We determine an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of 2H2 or 3C1 Fab in complex with the S trimer up to 3.8 A resolution, revealing the conformational space of the antigen-antibody complexes and MAb-triggered stepwise allosteric rearrangements of the S trimer, delineating a previously uncharacterized dynamic process of coordinated binding of neutralizing antibodies to the trimeric S protein. Our findings provide important information for the development of MAb-based drugs for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infections.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic, some patients with severe COVID‑19 exhibited complications such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which was closely associated with a poor prognosis. These patients often had an abnormal coagulation, namely, elevated levels of D‑dimer and fibrinogen, and a low platelet count. Certain studies have suggested that COVID‑19 induces AIS by promoting hypercoagulability. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms through which COVID‑19 leads to a hypercoagulable state in infected patients remain unclear. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of hypercoagulability is of utmost importance for the effective treatment of these patients. The present review aims to summarize the current status of research on COVID‑19, hypercoagulability and ischemic stroke. The present review also aimed to shed light into the underlying mechanisms through which COVID‑19 induces hypercoagulability, and to provide therapies for different mechanisms for the more effective treatment of patients with COVID‑19 with ischemic stroke and prevent AIS during the COVID‑19 pandemic.

AB  - Since December 2019, COVID-19 has aroused global attention. Studies show the link between obesity and severe outcome of influenza and COVID-19. Thus, we aimed to compare the impacts of obesity on the severity and mortality of influenza and COVID-19 by performing a meta-analysis. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science from January 2009 to July 2020. The protocol was registered onto PROSPERO (CRD42020201461). After selection, 46 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed. We found obesity was a risk factor for the severity and mortality of influenza (ORsevere outcome = 1.56, CI: 1.28-1.90; ORmortality = 1.99, CI: 1.15-3.46). For COVID-19, obesity was a significant risk factor only for severe outcome (OR = 2.07, CI: 1.53-2.81) but not for mortality (OR = 1.57, CI: 0.85-2.90). Compared with obesity, morbid obesity was linked with a higher risk for the severity and mortality of both influenza (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.10-1.79) and COVID-19 (OR = 3.76, CI: 2.67-5.28). Thus, obesity should be recommended as a risk factor for the prognosis assessment of COVID-19. Special monitoring and earlier treatment should be implemented in patients with obesity and COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerged coronavirus, and has been pandemic since March 2020 and led to many fatalities. Vaccines represent the most efficient means to control and stop the pandemic of COVID-19. However, currently there is no effective COVID-19 vaccine approved to use worldwide except for two human adenovirus vector vaccines, three inactivated vaccines, and one peptide vaccine for early or limited use in China and Russia. Safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 are in urgent need. Researchers around the world are developing 213 COVID-19 candidate vaccines, among which 44 are in human trials. In this review, we summarize and analyze vaccine progress against SARS-CoV, Middle-East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, including inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus like particles, nucleic acid vaccines, and viral vector vaccines. As SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV share the common genus, Betacoronavirus, this review of the major research progress will provide a reference and new insights into the COVID-19 vaccine design and development.

AB  - Following outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third highly pathogenic emerging human coronavirus (hCoV). SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CoV infections in target cells may stimulate the formation of numerous double-membrane autophagosomes and induce autophagy. Several studies provided evidence that hCoV infections are closely related to various cellular aspects associated with autophagy. Autophagy may even promote hCoV infection and replication. However, so far it is unclear how hCoV infections induce autophagy and whether the autophagic machinery is necessary for viral propagation. Here, we summarize the most recent advances concerning the mutual interplay between the autophagic machinery and the three emerging hCoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and the model system mouse hepatitis virus. We also discuss the applicability of approved and well-tolerated drugs targeting autophagy as potential treatment against COVID-19.

AB  - Many countries have enacted a quick response to the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing existing technologies. For example, robotics, artificial intelligence, and digital technology have been deployed in hospitals and public areas for maintaining social distancing, reducing person-to-person contact, enabling rapid diagnosis, tracking virus spread, and providing sanitation. In this paper, 163 news articles and scientific reports on COVID-19-related technology adoption were screened, shortlisted, categorized by application scenario, and reviewed for functionality. Technologies related to robots, artificial intelligence, and digital technology were selected from the pool of candidates, yielding a total of 50 applications for review. Each case was analyzed for its engineering characteristics and potential impact on the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, challenges and future directions regarding the response to this pandemic and future pandemics were summarized and discussed.

AB  - For prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, an effective vaccine is critical. Herein, several potential peptide epitopes from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been synthesized and covalently linked with the cross-reactive material (CRM197). Immunization of mice with the resulting conjugates induced high titers of IgG antibodies against the spike protein. Importantly, the post-immune sera effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, suggesting the epitopes identified are protective, and these conjugates are promising leads for anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virus neutralization by antibodies is an important prognostic factor in many viral diseases. To easily and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal murine leukemia virus genome encoding firefly luciferase. This assay design is intended for use in laboratories with biocontainment level 2 and therefore circumvents the need for the biocontainment level 3 that would be required for replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus. To validate the pseudovirion assay, we set up comparisons with other available antibody tests including those from Abbott, Euroimmun and Siemens, using archived, known samples. RESULTS: 11 out of 12 SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum samples showed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudotyped MLV viruses, with neutralizing titers-50 (NT50) that ranged from 1:25 to 1:1,417. Five historical samples from patients hospitalized for severe influenza infection in 2016 tested negative in the neutralization assay (NT50 < 25). Three serum samples with high neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2/MLV pseudoviruses showed no detectable neutralizing activity (NT50 < 25) against SARS-CoV-1/MLV pseudovirions. We also compared the semiquantitative Siemens SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which measures binding of IgG to recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the neutralization titers obtained in the pseudovirion assay and the results show high concordance between the two tests (R2 = 0.9344). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 spike/MLV pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing neutralizing activity of antibodies in serum or plasma from infected patients under laboratory conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2. This assay offers promise also in evaluating immunogenicity of spike glycoprotein-based candidate vaccines in the near future.

AB  - In any 'omics study, the scale of analysis can dramatically affect the outcome. For instance, when clustering single-cell transcriptomes, is the analysis tuned to discover broad or specific cell types? Likewise, protein communities revealed from protein networks can vary widely in sizes depending on the method. Here, we use the concept of persistent homology, drawn from mathematical topology, to identify robust structures in data at all scales simultaneously. Application to mouse single-cell transcriptomes significantly expands the catalog of identified cell types, while analysis of SARS-COV-2 protein interactions suggests hijacking of WNT. The method, HiDeF, is available via Python and Cytoscape.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 can affect various organ systems including the skin. Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in infected patients are poorly characterized. Objective: To summarize retrospectively the skin features of COVID-19 infection and to analyze the skin rash incidence rate, clinical onset time, cutaneous manifestations, pathological characteristics and relationship with the novel coronavirus pneumonia severity. Methods: The literature up to Sep 20, 2020, were searched and analyzed. Information on clinical features including skin manifestations, disease severity, stage and onset day, and cutaneous pathological characteristics was extracted. Data were analyzed using descriptive non-parametric statistics. For categorical data, the number and percentage of patients are presented. A Spearman correlation test was used to analyze the associations between rash type, rash onset and severity of COVID-19. All statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software (version 20) using two-tailed tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Twenty-three cases of COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations from seven reports were collected. Inflammatory dermatosis, skin vasculitis and vascular dermatosis were the main lesion types of COVID-19 patients. Microvascular and endothelial cell injury, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, thrombosis, extremely dilated vessels and prominent deposits of C5b-9 were the main dermatologic pathological changes. The onset day analysis showed that out of 19 patients, 63.2% of cutaneous manifestations were within 10 days, 21.1% in 10-20 days and 15.8% were 20 days after the time the patient presented with COVID-19 main symptoms. Spearman rho analysis found no correlation between skin rash type, onset day and COVID-19 severity. Conclusion: COVID-19 induced skin changes are one of the manifestations of immune responses to the novel coronavirus. Clinical and pathological characteristics were identified as dermal inflammatory reactions and/or skin vascular injury. External or systematic use of anti-inflammatories, protection of blood vessels and circulation-improving medicines should be considered in the skin treatments for novel coronavirus pneumonia patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first discovered at the end of 2019. It has led to more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths across 219 countries as of 11 November 2020, according to WHO statistics. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are similar. They are highly pathogenic and threaten public health, impair the economy, and inflict long-term impacts on society. No drug or vaccine has been approved as a treatment for these viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral measures have been hampered by the insufficient understanding of how the human body responds to viral infections at the cellular and molecular levels. RESULTS: In this study, journal articles and transcriptomic and proteomic data surveying coronavirus infections were collected. Response genes and proteins were then identified by differential analyses comparing gene/protein levels between infected and control samples. Finally, the H2V database was created to contain the human genes and proteins that respond to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: H2V provides molecular information about the human response to infection. It can be a powerful tool to discover cellular pathways and processes relevant for viral pathogenesis to identify potential drug targets. It is expected to accelerate the process of antiviral agent development and to inform preparations for potential future coronavirus-related emergencies. The database is available at: http://www.zhounan.org/h2v .

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 infection has been recognised as one important complication associated with in-hospital mortality. The potential dose-response effect of cardiac troponin (cTn) concentrations on adverse clinical outcomes has not been systematically studied. Hence, we will conduct a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between elevated cTn concentrations and in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and ISI Knowledge via Web of Science databases, as well as preprint databases (medRxiv and bioRxiv), from inception to October 2021, to identify all retrospective and prospective cohorts and randomised controlled studies using related keywords. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality during hospitalisation. The secondary outcome will be major adverse event (MAE). To conduct a dose-response meta-analysis of the potential linear or restricted cubic spline regression relationship between elevated cTn concentrations and all-cause mortality or MAE, studies with three or more categories of cTn concentrations will be included. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be conducted to compare elevated and non-elevated categories of cTn concentration. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of our results by removing each included study at one time to obtain and evaluate the remaining overall estimates of all-cause mortality or MAE. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: In accordance with the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of Fuwai Hospital, ethical approval was waived for this systematic review protocol. This meta-analysis will be disseminated through a peer-reviewing process for journal publication and conference communication. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020216059.

AB  - In order to control the spread of COVID-19, China had implemented strict lockdown measures. The closure of cities had had a huge impact on human production and consumption activities, which had greatly reduced population mobility. This article used air pollutant data from 341 cities in mainland China and divided these cities into seven major regions based on geographic conditions and climatic environment. The impact of urban blockade on air quality during COVID-19 was studied from the perspectives of time, space, and season. In addition, this article used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to systematically analyze the characteristics of air pollution in the country and used the Pearson correlation coefficient to explore the relationship between NDVI and the air pollutant concentrations during the COVID-19 period. Then, linear regression was used to find the quantitative relationship between NDVI and AQI, and the fitting effect of the model was found to be significant through t test. Finally, some countermeasures were proposed based on the analysis results, and suggestions were provided for improving air quality. This paper has drawn the following conclusions: (1) the concentration of pollutants varied greatly in different regions, and the causes of their pollution sources were also different. The region with the largest decline in AQI was the Northeast China (60.01%), while the AQI in the southwest China had the smallest change range, and its value had increased by 1.72%. In addition, after the implementation of the city blockade, the concentration of NO2 in different regions dropped the most, but the increase in O3 was more obvious. (2) Higher vegetation coverage would have a beneficial impact on the atmospheric environment. Areas with higher NDVI values have relatively low AQI. There is a negative correlation between NDVI and AQI, and an average increase of 0.1 in NDVI will reduce AQI by 3.75 (95% confidence interval). In the case of less human intervention, the higher the vegetation coverage, the lower the local pollutant concentration will be. Therefore, the degree of vegetation coverage would have a direct or indirect impact on air pollution.

AB  - We describe the trend of antibiotic prescribing in out-of-hours (OOH) general practices (GP) before and during England's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed practice-level prescribing records between January 2016 to June 2020 to report the trends for the total prescribing volume, prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics and key agents included in the national Quality Premium. We performed a time-series analysis to detect measurable changes in the prescribing volume associated with COVID-19. Before COVID-19, the total prescribing volume and the percentage of broad-spectrum antibiotics continued to decrease in-hours (IH). The prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics was higher in OOH (OOH: 10.1%, IH: 8.7%), but a consistent decrease in the trimethoprim-to-nitrofurantoin ratio was observed OOH. The OOH antibiotic prescribing volume diverged from the historical trend in March 2020 and started to decrease by 5088 items per month. Broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing started to increase in OOH and IH. In OOH, co-amoxiclav and doxycycline peaked in March to May in 2020, which was out of sync with seasonality peaks (Winter) in previous years. While this increase might be explained by the implementation of the national guideline to use co-amoxiclav and doxycycline to manage pneumonia in the community during COVID-19, further investigation is required to see whether the observed reduction in OOH antibiotic prescribing persists and how this reduction might influence antimicrobial resistance and patient outcomes.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, attacks multiple organs of the human body by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter cells. More than 20 million people have already been infected by the virus. ACE2 is not only a functional receptor of COVID-19 but also an important endogenous antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). A large number of studies have shown that ACE2 can reverse myocardial injury in various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as well as is exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anticardiomyocyte fibrosis effects by regulating transforming growth factor beta, mitogen-activated protein kinases, calcium ions in cells and other major pathways. The ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis plays a decisive role in the cardiovascular system to combat the negative effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II type 1 receptor axis. However, the underlying mechanism of ACE2 in cardiac protection remains unclear. Some approaches for enhancing ACE2 expression in CVDs have been suggested, which may provide targets for the development of novel clinical therapies. In this review, we aimed to identify and summarize the role of ACE2 in CVDs.

AB  - The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus initiated a pneumonia outbreak (COVID-19) that rapidly spread worldwide and quickly became a public health emergency of international concern; However to date, except Remdesivir, there are no clinically approved specific or effective medicines to prevent or treat COVID-19. Therefore, the development of novel treatments against coronavirus infections caused by the current SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, represents an urgent unmet need. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a central role in host defense mechanisms against microbial infections. STING activation leads to the induction of both type I interferon and autophagy responses, which elicit strong inhibitory effect against the infections caused by a broad range of microbial pathogens. However, whether STING activation can impact infections from SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-coronavirus activity triggered by STING activation. We discovered that dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI), a synthetic small molecule STING receptor agonist, showed potent anti-coronavirus activity against both the common cold human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture systems. In addition, we demonstrated that the antiviral activity of diABZI was dependent on the interferon pathway in HCoV-229E infected normal human fibroblast lung cells (MRC-5) and reconstituted primary human airway air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Furthermore, low-dose of diABZI treatment at 0.1 μM effectively reduced the SARS-CoV-2 viral load at the epithelial apical surface and prevented epithelial damage in the reconstituted primary human bronchial airway epithelial ALI system. Our findings have thus revealed the therapeutic potential of STING agonists, such as diABZI, as treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections.

AB  - Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) has long been at the forefront of the battle with cancer that began last century with the therapeutic application of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against melanoma. The development of novel ACT approaches led researchers and clinicians to highly efficient technologies based on genetically engineered T lymphocytes, with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells as the most prominent example. CARs consist of an extracellular domain that represents the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) responsible for target recognition and the intracellular domain, which was built from up to several signaling motifs that mediated T cell activation. The number of potential targets amenable for CAR-T cell therapy is expanding rapidly, which means that the tremendous success of this approach in oncology could be further translated to treating other diseases. In this review, we outlined modern trends and recent developments in CAR-T cell therapy from an unusual point of view by focusing on diseases beyond cancer, such as autoimmune disorders and viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microlaryngoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure. This paper presents a novel approach for better protecting staff during microlaryngoscopy. METHODS: A clear plastic microscope drape is attached to the objective lens. Instead of using the drape to cover the microscope, it is pulled down to cover the patient's head and torso. The holes designated for the binoculars of the microscope are used for the surgeon hands, forming protective clear plastic sleeves. CONCLUSION: The proposed technique, which is simple, relatively inexpensive and technically feasible for any hospital to perform during microlaryngoscopy procedures, can increase safety and minimise droplet and aerosol exposure in the operating theatre.

AB  - Gastrointestinal disorders caused by enteric viruses are frequently reported in dogs worldwide, with significant mortality rates in unvaccinated individuals. This study reports the identification and molecular characterization of Canine parvovirus (CPV-2), Canine coronavirus (CcoV), Canine astrovirus (AstV), and Canine calicivirus (CcaV) in a panel of dogs showing severe enteric clinical signs sampled in a typical Mediterranean environment (Sardinia, Italy). At least one of these viral species was detected in 92.3% samples. CPV-2 was the most frequently detected virus (87.2%), followed by AsTv (20.5%), CCoV-IIa (18%), and CCoV-I (10.3%). CCoV-IIb and CaCV were not detected in any sample. Single infection was detected in 24 samples (66.7%), mainly related to CPV-2 (91.7%). Coinfections were present in 33.3% samples with constant detection of CPV-2. Canine coronavirus was present only in coinfected animals. The VP2 sequence analysis of CPV-2 positive samples confirmed the presence of all variants, with CPV-2b most frequently detected. Phylogeny based on the CcoV-IIa spike protein (S) gene allowed to identify 2 different clades among Sardinian isolates but failed to distinguish enteric from pantropic viruses. Study on presence and prevalence of enteroviruses in dogs increase our knowledge about the circulation of these pathogens in the Mediterranean area and highlight the need for dedicated routine vaccine prophylaxis. Molecular analyses of enteric viruses are fundamental to avoid failure of vaccines caused by frequent mutations observed in these enteroviruses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes the occurrence of a silent mutation in the RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N protein) coding gene from SARS-CoV-2 that may consequence to a missense mutation by onset of another single nucleotide mutation. RESULTS: In the DNA sequence isolated from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Iran, a coding sequence for the RNA binding domain of N protein was detected. The comparison of Chinese and Iranian DNA sequences displayed that a thymine (T) was mutated to cytosine (C), so "TTG" from China was changed to "CTG" in Iran. Both DNA sequences from Iran and China have been encoded for leucine. In addition, the second T in "CTG" in the DNA or uracil (U) in "CUG" in the RNA sequences from Iran can be mutated to another C by a missense mutation resulting from thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) of human and base excision repair mechanism to produce "CCG" encoding for proline, which consequently may increase the affinity of the RNA binding domain of N protein to viral RNA and improve the transcription rate, pathogenicity, evasion from human immunity system, spreading in the human body, and risk of human-to-human transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - We recognise that people lie to health professionals for several reasons. However, these incidents endanger the well-being of the professionals and bring us to the question of whether people have an exclusive moral duty to always profess the truth about their health and other facts, particularly in a pandemic crisis. This review argues that an honest patient is a key to undertaking their roles as health professionals and delivering the best services possible to meet the needs of the patient. Greater awareness and comprehension of the potential ramifications of dishonesty, not only helps establish the moral obligation, to tell the truth, particularly in a pandemic situation, but also translates into a better relationship with health professionals. It also enforces an ethical solidarity on every single of us to show tangible moral response to ensure that those most vulnerable to risks from the pandemic illness such as health professionals are protected as far as possible.
